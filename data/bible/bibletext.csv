"1","Genesis","1","1","In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.  "
"2","Genesis","1","2","Now the earth was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters. "
"3","Genesis","1","3","And God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light.  "
"4","Genesis","1","4","God saw that the light was good, and he separated the light from the darkness.  "
"5","Genesis","1","5","God called the light “day,” and the darkness he called “night.” And there was evening, and there was morning—the first day. "
"6","Genesis","1","6","And God said, “Let there be a vault between the waters to separate water from water.”  "
"7","Genesis","1","7","So God made the vault and separated the water under the vault from the water above it. And it was so.  "
"8","Genesis","1","8","God called the vault “sky.” And there was evening, and there was morning—the second day. "
"9","Genesis","1","9","And God said, “Let the water under the sky be gathered to one place, and let dry ground appear.” And it was so.  "
"10","Genesis","1","10","God called the dry ground “land,” and the gathered waters he called “seas.” And God saw that it was good. "
"11","Genesis","1","11","Then God said, “Let the land produce vegetation: seed-bearing plants and trees on the land that bear fruit with seed in it, according to their various kinds.” And it was so.  "
"12","Genesis","1","12","The land produced vegetation: plants bearing seed according to their kinds and trees bearing fruit with seed in it according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good.  "
"13","Genesis","1","13","And there was evening, and there was morning—the third day. "
"14","Genesis","1","14","And God said, “Let there be lights in the vault of the sky to separate the day from the night, and let them serve as signs to mark sacred times, and days and years,  "
"15","Genesis","1","15","and let them be lights in the vault of the sky to give light on the earth.” And it was so.  "
"16","Genesis","1","16","God made two great lights—the greater light to govern the day and the lesser light to govern the night. He also made the stars.  "
"17","Genesis","1","17","God set them in the vault of the sky to give light on the earth,  "
"18","Genesis","1","18","to govern the day and the night, and to separate light from darkness. And God saw that it was good.  "
"19","Genesis","1","19","And there was evening, and there was morning—the fourth day. "
"20","Genesis","1","20","And God said, “Let the water teem with living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the vault of the sky.”  "
"21","Genesis","1","21","So God created the great creatures of the sea and every living thing with which the water teems and that moves about in it, according to their kinds, and every winged bird according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.  "
"22","Genesis","1","22","God blessed them and said, “Be fruitful and increase in number and fill the water in the seas, and let the birds increase on the earth.”  "
"23","Genesis","1","23","And there was evening, and there was morning—the fifth day. "
"24","Genesis","1","24","And God said, “Let the land produce living creatures according to their kinds: the livestock, the creatures that move along the ground, and the wild animals, each according to its kind.” And it was so.  "
"25","Genesis","1","25","God made the wild animals according to their kinds, the livestock according to their kinds, and all the creatures that move along the ground according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good. "
"26","Genesis","1","26","Then God said, “Let us make mankind in our image, in our likeness, so that they may rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky, over the livestock and all the wild animals,  and over all the creatures that move along the ground.” "
"27","Genesis","1","27","So God created mankind in his own image, in the image of God he created them; male and female he created them. "
"28","Genesis","1","28","God blessed them and said to them, “Be fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it. Rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky and over every living creature that moves on the ground.” "
"29","Genesis","1","29","Then God said, “I give you every seed-bearing plant on the face of the whole earth and every tree that has fruit with seed in it. They will be yours for food.  "
"30","Genesis","1","30","And to all the beasts of the earth and all the birds in the sky and all the creatures that move along the ground—everything that has the breath of life in it—I give every green plant for food.” And it was so. "
"31","Genesis","1","31","God saw all that he had made, and it was very good. And there was evening, and there was morning—the sixth day."
"32","Genesis","2","1","Thus the heavens and the earth were completed in all their vast array. "
"33","Genesis","2","2","By the seventh day God had finished the work he had been doing; so on the seventh day he rested from all his work.  "
"34","Genesis","2","3","Then God blessed the seventh day and made it holy, because on it he rested from all the work of creating that he had done. "
"35","Genesis","2","4","This is the account of the heavens and the earth when they were created, when the  Lord  God made the earth and the heavens. "
"36","Genesis","2","5","Now no shrub had yet appeared on the earth  and no plant had yet sprung up, for the  Lord  God had not sent rain on the earth and there was no one to work the ground,  "
"37","Genesis","2","6","but streams  came up from the earth and watered the whole surface of the ground.  "
"38","Genesis","2","7","Then the  Lord  God formed a man  from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living being. "
"39","Genesis","2","8","Now the  Lord  God had planted a garden in the east, in Eden; and there he put the man he had formed.  "
"40","Genesis","2","9","The  Lord  God made all kinds of trees grow out of the ground—trees that were pleasing to the eye and good for food. In the middle of the garden were the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. "
"41","Genesis","2","10","A river watering the garden flowed from Eden; from there it was separated into four headwaters.  "
"42","Genesis","2","11","The name of the first is the Pishon; it winds through the entire land of Havilah, where there is gold.  "
"43","Genesis","2","12","(The gold of that land is good; aromatic resin  and onyx are also there.)  "
"44","Genesis","2","13","The name of the second river is the Gihon; it winds through the entire land of Cush.   "
"45","Genesis","2","14","The name of the third river is the Tigris; it runs along the east side of Ashur. And the fourth river is the Euphrates. "
"46","Genesis","2","15","The  Lord  God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to work it and take care of it.  "
"47","Genesis","2","16","And the  Lord  God commanded the man, “You are free to eat from any tree in the garden;  "
"48","Genesis","2","17","but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat from it you will certainly die.” "
"49","Genesis","2","18","The  Lord  God said, “It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make a helper suitable for him.” "
"50","Genesis","2","19","Now the  Lord  God had formed out of the ground all the wild animals and all the birds in the sky. He brought them to the man to see what he would name them; and whatever the man called each living creature, that was its name.  "
"51","Genesis","2","20","So the man gave names to all the livestock, the birds in the sky and all the wild animals. But for Adam  no suitable helper was found.  "
"52","Genesis","2","21","So the  Lord  God caused the man to fall into a deep sleep; and while he was sleeping, he took one of the man’s ribs  and then closed up the place with flesh.  "
"53","Genesis","2","22","Then the  Lord  God made a woman from the rib  he had taken out of the man, and he brought her to the man. "
"54","Genesis","2","23","The man said, “This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called ‘woman,’ for she was taken out of man.” "
"55","Genesis","2","24","That is why a man leaves his father and mother and is united to his wife, and they become one flesh. "
"56","Genesis","2","25","Adam and his wife were both naked, and they felt no shame."
"57","Genesis","3","1","Now the serpent was more crafty than any of the wild animals the  Lord  God had made. He said to the woman, “Did God really say, ‘You must not eat from any tree in the garden’?” "
"58","Genesis","3","2","The woman said to the serpent, “We may eat fruit from the trees in the garden,  "
"59","Genesis","3","3","but God did say, ‘You must not eat fruit from the tree that is in the middle of the garden, and you must not touch it, or you will die.’ ” "
"60","Genesis","3","4","“You will not certainly die,” the serpent said to the woman.  "
"61","Genesis","3","5","“For God knows that when you eat from it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.” "
"62","Genesis","3","6","When the woman saw that the fruit of the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eye, and also desirable for gaining wisdom, she took some and ate it. She also gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate it.  "
"63","Genesis","3","7","Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they realized they were naked; so they sewed fig leaves together and made coverings for themselves. "
"64","Genesis","3","8","Then the man and his wife heard the sound of the  Lord  God as he was walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and they hid from the  Lord  God among the trees of the garden.  "
"65","Genesis","3","9","But the  Lord  God called to the man, “Where are you?” "
"66","Genesis","3","10","He answered, “I heard you in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked; so I hid.” "
"67","Genesis","3","11","And he said, “Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree that I commanded you not to eat from?” "
"68","Genesis","3","12","The man said, “The woman you put here with me—she gave me some fruit from the tree, and I ate it.” "
"69","Genesis","3","13","Then the  Lord  God said to the woman, “What is this you have done?” The woman said, “The serpent deceived me, and I ate.” "
"70","Genesis","3","14","So the  Lord  God said to the serpent, “Because you have done this, “Cursed are you above all livestock and all wild animals! You will crawl on your belly and you will eat dust all the days of your life. "
"71","Genesis","3","15","And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring  and hers; he will crush  your head, and you will strike his heel.” "
"72","Genesis","3","16","To the woman he said, “I will make your pains in childbearing very severe; with painful labor you will give birth to children. Your desire will be for your husband, and he will rule over you.” "
"73","Genesis","3","17","To Adam he said, “Because you listened to your wife and ate fruit from the tree about which I commanded you, ‘You must not eat from it,’ “Cursed is the ground because of you; through painful toil you will eat food from it all the days of your life. "
"74","Genesis","3","18","It will produce thorns and thistles for you, and you will eat the plants of the field. "
"75","Genesis","3","19","By the sweat of your brow you will eat your food until you return to the ground, since from it you were taken; for dust you are and to dust you will return.” "
"76","Genesis","3","20","Adam  named his wife Eve,  because she would become the mother of all the living. "
"77","Genesis","3","21","The  Lord  God made garments of skin for Adam and his wife and clothed them.  "
"78","Genesis","3","22","And the  Lord  God said, “The man has now become like one of us, knowing good and evil. He must not be allowed to reach out his hand and take also from the tree of life and eat, and live forever.”  "
"79","Genesis","3","23","So the  Lord  God banished him from the Garden of Eden to work the ground from which he had been taken.  "
"80","Genesis","3","24","After he drove the man out, he placed on the east side  of the Garden of Eden cherubim and a flaming sword flashing back and forth to guard the way to the tree of life."
"81","Genesis","4","1","Adam  made love to his wife Eve, and she became pregnant and gave birth to Cain.  She said, “With the help of the  Lord  I have brought forth  a man.”  "
"82","Genesis","4","2","Later she gave birth to his brother Abel. Now Abel kept flocks, and Cain worked the soil.  "
"83","Genesis","4","3","In the course of time Cain brought some of the fruits of the soil as an offering to the  Lord .  "
"84","Genesis","4","4","And Abel also brought an offering—fat portions from some of the firstborn of his flock. The  Lord  looked with favor on Abel and his offering,  "
"85","Genesis","4","5","but on Cain and his offering he did not look with favor. So Cain was very angry, and his face was downcast. "
"86","Genesis","4","6","Then the  Lord  said to Cain, “Why are you angry? Why is your face downcast?  "
"87","Genesis","4","7","If you do what is right, will you not be accepted? But if you do not do what is right, sin is crouching at your door; it desires to have you, but you must rule over it.” "
"88","Genesis","4","8","Now Cain said to his brother Abel, “Let’s go out to the field.”  While they were in the field, Cain attacked his brother Abel and killed him. "
"89","Genesis","4","9","Then the  Lord  said to Cain, “Where is your brother Abel?” “I don’t know,” he replied. “Am I my brother’s keeper?” "
"90","Genesis","4","10","The  Lord  said, “What have you done? Listen! Your brother’s blood cries out to me from the ground.  "
"91","Genesis","4","11","Now you are under a curse and driven from the ground, which opened its mouth to receive your brother’s blood from your hand.  "
"92","Genesis","4","12","When you work the ground, it will no longer yield its crops for you. You will be a restless wanderer on the earth.” "
"93","Genesis","4","13","Cain said to the  Lord , “My punishment is more than I can bear.  "
"94","Genesis","4","14","Today you are driving me from the land, and I will be hidden from your presence; I will be a restless wanderer on the earth, and whoever finds me will kill me.” "
"95","Genesis","4","15","But the  Lord  said to him, “Not so ; anyone who kills Cain will suffer vengeance seven times over.” Then the  Lord  put a mark on Cain so that no one who found him would kill him.  "
"96","Genesis","4","16","So Cain went out from the  Lord ’s presence and lived in the land of Nod,  east of Eden. "
"97","Genesis","4","17","Cain made love to his wife, and she became pregnant and gave birth to Enoch. Cain was then building a city, and he named it after his son Enoch.  "
"98","Genesis","4","18","To Enoch was born Irad, and Irad was the father of Mehujael, and Mehujael was the father of Methushael, and Methushael was the father of Lamech. "
"99","Genesis","4","19","Lamech married two women, one named Adah and the other Zillah.  "
"100","Genesis","4","20","Adah gave birth to Jabal; he was the father of those who live in tents and raise livestock.  "
"101","Genesis","4","21","His brother’s name was Jubal; he was the father of all who play stringed instruments and pipes.  "
"102","Genesis","4","22","Zillah also had a son, Tubal-Cain, who forged all kinds of tools out of  bronze and iron. Tubal-Cain’s sister was Naamah. "
"103","Genesis","4","23","Lamech said to his wives, “Adah and Zillah, listen to me; wives of Lamech, hear my words. I have killed a man for wounding me, a young man for injuring me. "
"104","Genesis","4","24","If Cain is avenged seven times, then Lamech seventy-seven times.” "
"105","Genesis","4","25","Adam made love to his wife again, and she gave birth to a son and named him Seth,  saying, “God has granted me another child in place of Abel, since Cain killed him.”  "
"106","Genesis","4","26","Seth also had a son, and he named him Enosh. At that time people began to call on  the name of the  Lord ."
"107","Genesis","5","1","This is the written account of Adam’s family line. When God created mankind, he made them in the likeness of God.  "
"108","Genesis","5","2","He created them male and female and blessed them. And he named them “Mankind”  when they were created. "
"109","Genesis","5","3","When Adam had lived 130 years, he had a son in his own likeness, in his own image; and he named him Seth.  "
"110","Genesis","5","4","After Seth was born, Adam lived 800 years and had other sons and daughters.  "
"111","Genesis","5","5","Altogether, Adam lived a total of 930 years, and then he died. "
"112","Genesis","5","6","When Seth had lived 105 years, he became the father  of Enosh.  "
"113","Genesis","5","7","After he became the father of Enosh, Seth lived 807 years and had other sons and daughters.  "
"114","Genesis","5","8","Altogether, Seth lived a total of 912 years, and then he died. "
"115","Genesis","5","9","When Enosh had lived 90 years, he became the father of Kenan.  "
"116","Genesis","5","10","After he became the father of Kenan, Enosh lived 815 years and had other sons and daughters.  "
"117","Genesis","5","11","Altogether, Enosh lived a total of 905 years, and then he died. "
"118","Genesis","5","12","When Kenan had lived 70 years, he became the father of Mahalalel.  "
"119","Genesis","5","13","After he became the father of Mahalalel, Kenan lived 840 years and had other sons and daughters.  "
"120","Genesis","5","14","Altogether, Kenan lived a total of 910 years, and then he died. "
"121","Genesis","5","15","When Mahalalel had lived 65 years, he became the father of Jared.  "
"122","Genesis","5","16","After he became the father of Jared, Mahalalel lived 830 years and had other sons and daughters.  "
"123","Genesis","5","17","Altogether, Mahalalel lived a total of 895 years, and then he died. "
"124","Genesis","5","18","When Jared had lived 162 years, he became the father of Enoch.  "
"125","Genesis","5","19","After he became the father of Enoch, Jared lived 800 years and had other sons and daughters.  "
"126","Genesis","5","20","Altogether, Jared lived a total of 962 years, and then he died. "
"127","Genesis","5","21","When Enoch had lived 65 years, he became the father of Methuselah.  "
"128","Genesis","5","22","After he became the father of Methuselah, Enoch walked faithfully with God 300 years and had other sons and daughters.  "
"129","Genesis","5","23","Altogether, Enoch lived a total of 365 years.  "
"130","Genesis","5","24","Enoch walked faithfully with God; then he was no more, because God took him away. "
"131","Genesis","5","25","When Methuselah had lived 187 years, he became the father of Lamech.  "
"132","Genesis","5","26","After he became the father of Lamech, Methuselah lived 782 years and had other sons and daughters.  "
"133","Genesis","5","27","Altogether, Methuselah lived a total of 969 years, and then he died. "
"134","Genesis","5","28","When Lamech had lived 182 years, he had a son.  "
"135","Genesis","5","29","He named him Noah  and said, “He will comfort us in the labor and painful toil of our hands caused by the ground the  Lord  has cursed.”  "
"136","Genesis","5","30","After Noah was born, Lamech lived 595 years and had other sons and daughters.  "
"137","Genesis","5","31","Altogether, Lamech lived a total of 777 years, and then he died. "
"138","Genesis","5","32","After Noah was 500 years old, he became the father of Shem, Ham and Japheth."
"139","Genesis","6","1","When human beings began to increase in number on the earth and daughters were born to them,  "
"140","Genesis","6","2","the sons of God saw that the daughters of humans were beautiful, and they married any of them they chose.  "
"141","Genesis","6","3","Then the  Lord  said, “My Spirit will not contend with  humans forever, for they are mortal ; their days will be a hundred and twenty years.” "
"142","Genesis","6","4","The Nephilim were on the earth in those days—and also afterward—when the sons of God went to the daughters of humans and had children by them. They were the heroes of old, men of renown. "
"143","Genesis","6","5","The  Lord  saw how great the wickedness of the human race had become on the earth, and that every inclination of the thoughts of the human heart was only evil all the time.  "
"144","Genesis","6","6","The  Lord  regretted that he had made human beings on the earth, and his heart was deeply troubled.  "
"145","Genesis","6","7","So the  Lord  said, “I will wipe from the face of the earth the human race I have created—and with them the animals, the birds and the creatures that move along the ground—for I regret that I have made them.”  "
"146","Genesis","6","8","But Noah found favor in the eyes of the  Lord . "
"147","Genesis","6","9","This is the account of Noah and his family. Noah was a righteous man, blameless among the people of his time, and he walked faithfully with God.  "
"148","Genesis","6","10","Noah had three sons: Shem, Ham and Japheth. "
"149","Genesis","6","11","Now the earth was corrupt in God’s sight and was full of violence.  "
"150","Genesis","6","12","God saw how corrupt the earth had become, for all the people on earth had corrupted their ways.  "
"151","Genesis","6","13","So God said to Noah, “I am going to put an end to all people, for the earth is filled with violence because of them. I am surely going to destroy both them and the earth.  "
"152","Genesis","6","14","So make yourself an ark of cypress  wood; make rooms in it and coat it with pitch inside and out.  "
"153","Genesis","6","15","This is how you are to build it: The ark is to be three hundred cubits long, fifty cubits wide and thirty cubits high.   "
"154","Genesis","6","16","Make a roof for it, leaving below the roof an opening one cubit  high all around.  Put a door in the side of the ark and make lower, middle and upper decks.  "
"155","Genesis","6","17","I am going to bring floodwaters on the earth to destroy all life under the heavens, every creature that has the breath of life in it. Everything on earth will perish.  "
"156","Genesis","6","18","But I will establish my covenant with you, and you will enter the ark—you and your sons and your wife and your sons’ wives with you.  "
"157","Genesis","6","19","You are to bring into the ark two of all living creatures, male and female, to keep them alive with you.  "
"158","Genesis","6","20","Two of every kind of bird, of every kind of animal and of every kind of creature that moves along the ground will come to you to be kept alive.  "
"159","Genesis","6","21","You are to take every kind of food that is to be eaten and store it away as food for you and for them.” "
"160","Genesis","6","22","Noah did everything just as God commanded him."
"161","Genesis","7","1","The  Lord  then said to Noah, “Go into the ark, you and your whole family, because I have found you righteous in this generation.  "
"162","Genesis","7","2","Take with you seven pairs of every kind of clean animal, a male and its mate, and one pair of every kind of unclean animal, a male and its mate,  "
"163","Genesis","7","3","and also seven pairs of every kind of bird, male and female, to keep their various kinds alive throughout the earth.  "
"164","Genesis","7","4","Seven days from now I will send rain on the earth for forty days and forty nights, and I will wipe from the face of the earth every living creature I have made.” "
"165","Genesis","7","5","And Noah did all that the  Lord  commanded him. "
"166","Genesis","7","6","Noah was six hundred years old when the floodwaters came on the earth.  "
"167","Genesis","7","7","And Noah and his sons and his wife and his sons’ wives entered the ark to escape the waters of the flood.  "
"168","Genesis","7","8","Pairs of clean and unclean animals, of birds and of all creatures that move along the ground,  "
"169","Genesis","7","9","male and female, came to Noah and entered the ark, as God had commanded Noah.  "
"170","Genesis","7","10","And after the seven days the floodwaters came on the earth. "
"171","Genesis","7","11","In the six hundredth year of Noah’s life, on the seventeenth day of the second month—on that day all the springs of the great deep burst forth, and the floodgates of the heavens were opened.  "
"172","Genesis","7","12","And rain fell on the earth forty days and forty nights. "
"173","Genesis","7","13","On that very day Noah and his sons, Shem, Ham and Japheth, together with his wife and the wives of his three sons, entered the ark.  "
"174","Genesis","7","14","They had with them every wild animal according to its kind, all livestock according to their kinds, every creature that moves along the ground according to its kind and every bird according to its kind, everything with wings.  "
"175","Genesis","7","15","Pairs of all creatures that have the breath of life in them came to Noah and entered the ark.  "
"176","Genesis","7","16","The animals going in were male and female of every living thing, as God had commanded Noah. Then the  Lord  shut him in. "
"177","Genesis","7","17","For forty days the flood kept coming on the earth, and as the waters increased they lifted the ark high above the earth.  "
"178","Genesis","7","18","The waters rose and increased greatly on the earth, and the ark floated on the surface of the water.  "
"179","Genesis","7","19","They rose greatly on the earth, and all the high mountains under the entire heavens were covered.  "
"180","Genesis","7","20","The waters rose and covered the mountains to a depth of more than fifteen cubits.   "
"181","Genesis","7","21","Every living thing that moved on land perished—birds, livestock, wild animals, all the creatures that swarm over the earth, and all mankind.  "
"182","Genesis","7","22","Everything on dry land that had the breath of life in its nostrils died.  "
"183","Genesis","7","23","Every living thing on the face of the earth was wiped out; people and animals and the creatures that move along the ground and the birds were wiped from the earth. Only Noah was left, and those with him in the ark. "
"184","Genesis","7","24","The waters flooded the earth for a hundred and fifty days."
"185","Genesis","8","1","But God remembered Noah and all the wild animals and the livestock that were with him in the ark, and he sent a wind over the earth, and the waters receded.  "
"186","Genesis","8","2","Now the springs of the deep and the floodgates of the heavens had been closed, and the rain had stopped falling from the sky.  "
"187","Genesis","8","3","The water receded steadily from the earth. At the end of the hundred and fifty days the water had gone down,  "
"188","Genesis","8","4","and on the seventeenth day of the seventh month the ark came to rest on the mountains of Ararat.  "
"189","Genesis","8","5","The waters continued to recede until the tenth month, and on the first day of the tenth month the tops of the mountains became visible. "
"190","Genesis","8","6","After forty days Noah opened a window he had made in the ark  "
"191","Genesis","8","7","and sent out a raven, and it kept flying back and forth until the water had dried up from the earth.  "
"192","Genesis","8","8","Then he sent out a dove to see if the water had receded from the surface of the ground.  "
"193","Genesis","8","9","But the dove could find nowhere to perch because there was water over all the surface of the earth; so it returned to Noah in the ark. He reached out his hand and took the dove and brought it back to himself in the ark.  "
"194","Genesis","8","10","He waited seven more days and again sent out the dove from the ark.  "
"195","Genesis","8","11","When the dove returned to him in the evening, there in its beak was a freshly plucked olive leaf! Then Noah knew that the water had receded from the earth.  "
"196","Genesis","8","12","He waited seven more days and sent the dove out again, but this time it did not return to him. "
"197","Genesis","8","13","By the first day of the first month of Noah’s six hundred and first year, the water had dried up from the earth. Noah then removed the covering from the ark and saw that the surface of the ground was dry.  "
"198","Genesis","8","14","By the twenty-seventh day of the second month the earth was completely dry. "
"199","Genesis","8","15","Then God said to Noah,  "
"200","Genesis","8","16","“Come out of the ark, you and your wife and your sons and their wives.  "
"201","Genesis","8","17","Bring out every kind of living creature that is with you—the birds, the animals, and all the creatures that move along the ground—so they can multiply on the earth and be fruitful and increase in number on it.” "
"202","Genesis","8","18","So Noah came out, together with his sons and his wife and his sons’ wives.  "
"203","Genesis","8","19","All the animals and all the creatures that move along the ground and all the birds—everything that moves on land—came out of the ark, one kind after another. "
"204","Genesis","8","20","Then Noah built an altar to the  Lord  and, taking some of all the clean animals and clean birds, he sacrificed burnt offerings on it.  "
"205","Genesis","8","21","The  Lord  smelled the pleasing aroma and said in his heart: “Never again will I curse the ground because of humans, even though  every inclination of the human heart is evil from childhood. And never again will I destroy all living creatures, as I have done. "
"206","Genesis","8","22","“As long as the earth endures, seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, day and night will never cease.”"
"207","Genesis","9","1","Then God blessed Noah and his sons, saying to them, “Be fruitful and increase in number and fill the earth.  "
"208","Genesis","9","2","The fear and dread of you will fall on all the beasts of the earth, and on all the birds in the sky, on every creature that moves along the ground, and on all the fish in the sea; they are given into your hands.  "
"209","Genesis","9","3","Everything that lives and moves about will be food for you. Just as I gave you the green plants, I now give you everything. "
"210","Genesis","9","4","“But you must not eat meat that has its lifeblood still in it.  "
"211","Genesis","9","5","And for your lifeblood I will surely demand an accounting. I will demand an accounting from every animal. And from each human being, too, I will demand an accounting for the life of another human being. "
"212","Genesis","9","6","“Whoever sheds human blood, by humans shall their blood be shed; for in the image of God has God made mankind. "
"213","Genesis","9","7","As for you, be fruitful and increase in number; multiply on the earth and increase upon it.” "
"214","Genesis","9","8","Then God said to Noah and to his sons with him:  "
"215","Genesis","9","9","“I now establish my covenant with you and with your descendants after you  "
"216","Genesis","9","10","and with every living creature that was with you—the birds, the livestock and all the wild animals, all those that came out of the ark with you—every living creature on earth.  "
"217","Genesis","9","11","I establish my covenant with you: Never again will all life be destroyed by the waters of a flood; never again will there be a flood to destroy the earth.” "
"218","Genesis","9","12","And God said, “This is the sign of the covenant I am making between me and you and every living creature with you, a covenant for all generations to come:  "
"219","Genesis","9","13","I have set my rainbow in the clouds, and it will be the sign of the covenant between me and the earth.  "
"220","Genesis","9","14","Whenever I bring clouds over the earth and the rainbow appears in the clouds,  "
"221","Genesis","9","15","I will remember my covenant between me and you and all living creatures of every kind. Never again will the waters become a flood to destroy all life.  "
"222","Genesis","9","16","Whenever the rainbow appears in the clouds, I will see it and remember the everlasting covenant between God and all living creatures of every kind on the earth.” "
"223","Genesis","9","17","So God said to Noah, “This is the sign of the covenant I have established between me and all life on the earth.” "
"224","Genesis","9","18","The sons of Noah who came out of the ark were Shem, Ham and Japheth. (Ham was the father of Canaan.)  "
"225","Genesis","9","19","These were the three sons of Noah, and from them came the people who were scattered over the whole earth. "
"226","Genesis","9","20","Noah, a man of the soil, proceeded  to plant a vineyard.  "
"227","Genesis","9","21","When he drank some of its wine, he became drunk and lay uncovered inside his tent.  "
"228","Genesis","9","22","Ham, the father of Canaan, saw his father naked and told his two brothers outside.  "
"229","Genesis","9","23","But Shem and Japheth took a garment and laid it across their shoulders; then they walked in backward and covered their father’s naked body. Their faces were turned the other way so that they would not see their father naked. "
"230","Genesis","9","24","When Noah awoke from his wine and found out what his youngest son had done to him,  "
"231","Genesis","9","25","he said, “Cursed be Canaan! The lowest of slaves will he be to his brothers.” "
"232","Genesis","9","26","He also said, “Praise be to the  Lord , the God of Shem! May Canaan be the slave of Shem. "
"233","Genesis","9","27","May God extend Japheth’s  territory; may Japheth live in the tents of Shem, and may Canaan be the slave of Japheth.” "
"234","Genesis","9","28","After the flood Noah lived 350 years.  "
"235","Genesis","9","29","Noah lived a total of 950 years, and then he died."
"236","Genesis","10","1","This is the account of Shem, Ham and Japheth, Noah’s sons, who themselves had sons after the flood. "
"237","Genesis","10","2","The sons  of Japheth: Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshek and Tiras. "
"238","Genesis","10","3","The sons of Gomer: Ashkenaz, Riphath and Togarmah. "
"239","Genesis","10","4","The sons of Javan: Elishah, Tarshish, the Kittites and the Rodanites.   "
"240","Genesis","10","5","(From these the maritime peoples spread out into their territories by their clans within their nations, each with its own language.) "
"241","Genesis","10","6","The sons of Ham: Cush, Egypt, Put and Canaan. "
"242","Genesis","10","7","The sons of Cush: Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah and Sabteka. The sons of Raamah: Sheba and Dedan. "
"243","Genesis","10","8","Cush was the father  of Nimrod, who became a mighty warrior on the earth.  "
"244","Genesis","10","9","He was a mighty hunter before the  Lord ; that is why it is said, “Like Nimrod, a mighty hunter before the  Lord .”  "
"245","Genesis","10","10","The first centers of his kingdom were Babylon, Uruk, Akkad and Kalneh, in  Shinar.   "
"246","Genesis","10","11","From that land he went to Assyria, where he built Nineveh, Rehoboth Ir,  Calah  "
"247","Genesis","10","12","and Resen, which is between Nineveh and Calah—which is the great city. "
"248","Genesis","10","13","Egypt was the father of the Ludites, Anamites, Lehabites, Naphtuhites,  "
"249","Genesis","10","14","Pathrusites, Kasluhites (from whom the Philistines came) and Caphtorites. "
"250","Genesis","10","15","Canaan was the father of Sidon his firstborn,  and of the Hittites,  "
"251","Genesis","10","16","Jebusites, Amorites, Girgashites,  "
"252","Genesis","10","17","Hivites, Arkites, Sinites,  "
"253","Genesis","10","18","Arvadites, Zemarites and Hamathites. Later the Canaanite clans scattered  "
"254","Genesis","10","19","and the borders of Canaan reached from Sidon toward Gerar as far as Gaza, and then toward Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboyim, as far as Lasha. "
"255","Genesis","10","20","These are the sons of Ham by their clans and languages, in their territories and nations. "
"256","Genesis","10","21","Sons were also born to Shem, whose older brother was  Japheth; Shem was the ancestor of all the sons of Eber. "
"257","Genesis","10","22","The sons of Shem: Elam, Ashur, Arphaxad, Lud and Aram. "
"258","Genesis","10","23","The sons of Aram: Uz, Hul, Gether and Meshek. "
"259","Genesis","10","24","Arphaxad was the father of  Shelah, and Shelah the father of Eber. "
"260","Genesis","10","25","Two sons were born to Eber: One was named Peleg,  because in his time the earth was divided; his brother was named Joktan. "
"261","Genesis","10","26","Joktan was the father of Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah,  "
"262","Genesis","10","27","Hadoram, Uzal, Diklah,  "
"263","Genesis","10","28","Obal, Abimael, Sheba,  "
"264","Genesis","10","29","Ophir, Havilah and Jobab. All these were sons of Joktan. "
"265","Genesis","10","30","The region where they lived stretched from Mesha toward Sephar, in the eastern hill country. "
"266","Genesis","10","31","These are the sons of Shem by their clans and languages, in their territories and nations. "
"267","Genesis","10","32","These are the clans of Noah’s sons, according to their lines of descent, within their nations. From these the nations spread out over the earth after the flood."
"268","Genesis","11","1","Now the whole world had one language and a common speech.  "
"269","Genesis","11","2","As people moved eastward,  they found a plain in Shinar  and settled there. "
"270","Genesis","11","3","They said to each other, “Come, let’s make bricks and bake them thoroughly.” They used brick instead of stone, and tar for mortar.  "
"271","Genesis","11","4","Then they said, “Come, let us build ourselves a city, with a tower that reaches to the heavens, so that we may make a name for ourselves; otherwise we will be scattered over the face of the whole earth.” "
"272","Genesis","11","5","But the  Lord  came down to see the city and the tower the people were building.  "
"273","Genesis","11","6","The  Lord  said, “If as one people speaking the same language they have begun to do this, then nothing they plan to do will be impossible for them.  "
"274","Genesis","11","7","Come, let us go down and confuse their language so they will not understand each other.” "
"275","Genesis","11","8","So the  Lord  scattered them from there over all the earth, and they stopped building the city.  "
"276","Genesis","11","9","That is why it was called Babel —because there the  Lord  confused the language of the whole world. From there the  Lord  scattered them over the face of the whole earth. "
"277","Genesis","11","10","This is the account of Shem’s family line. Two years after the flood, when Shem was 100 years old, he became the father  of Arphaxad.  "
"278","Genesis","11","11","And after he became the father of Arphaxad, Shem lived 500 years and had other sons and daughters. "
"279","Genesis","11","12","When Arphaxad had lived 35 years, he became the father of Shelah.  "
"280","Genesis","11","13","And after he became the father of Shelah, Arphaxad lived 403 years and had other sons and daughters. "
"281","Genesis","11","14","When Shelah had lived 30 years, he became the father of Eber.  "
"282","Genesis","11","15","And after he became the father of Eber, Shelah lived 403 years and had other sons and daughters. "
"283","Genesis","11","16","When Eber had lived 34 years, he became the father of Peleg.  "
"284","Genesis","11","17","And after he became the father of Peleg, Eber lived 430 years and had other sons and daughters. "
"285","Genesis","11","18","When Peleg had lived 30 years, he became the father of Reu.  "
"286","Genesis","11","19","And after he became the father of Reu, Peleg lived 209 years and had other sons and daughters. "
"287","Genesis","11","20","When Reu had lived 32 years, he became the father of Serug.  "
"288","Genesis","11","21","And after he became the father of Serug, Reu lived 207 years and had other sons and daughters. "
"289","Genesis","11","22","When Serug had lived 30 years, he became the father of Nahor.  "
"290","Genesis","11","23","And after he became the father of Nahor, Serug lived 200 years and had other sons and daughters. "
"291","Genesis","11","24","When Nahor had lived 29 years, he became the father of Terah.  "
"292","Genesis","11","25","And after he became the father of Terah, Nahor lived 119 years and had other sons and daughters. "
"293","Genesis","11","26","After Terah had lived 70 years, he became the father of Abram, Nahor and Haran. "
"294","Genesis","11","27","This is the account of Terah’s family line. Terah became the father of Abram, Nahor and Haran. And Haran became the father of Lot.  "
"295","Genesis","11","28","While his father Terah was still alive, Haran died in Ur of the Chaldeans, in the land of his birth.  "
"296","Genesis","11","29","Abram and Nahor both married. The name of Abram’s wife was Sarai, and the name of Nahor’s wife was Milkah; she was the daughter of Haran, the father of both Milkah and Iskah.  "
"297","Genesis","11","30","Now Sarai was childless because she was not able to conceive. "
"298","Genesis","11","31","Terah took his son Abram, his grandson Lot son of Haran, and his daughter-in-law Sarai, the wife of his son Abram, and together they set out from Ur of the Chaldeans to go to Canaan. But when they came to Harran, they settled there. "
"299","Genesis","11","32","Terah lived 205 years, and he died in Harran."
"300","Genesis","12","1","The  Lord  had said to Abram, “Go from your country, your people and your father’s household to the land I will show you. "
"301","Genesis","12","2","“I will make you into a great nation, and I will bless you; I will make your name great, and you will be a blessing. "
"302","Genesis","12","3","I will bless those who bless you, and whoever curses you I will curse; and all peoples on earth will be blessed through you.” "
"303","Genesis","12","4","So Abram went, as the  Lord  had told him; and Lot went with him. Abram was seventy-five years old when he set out from Harran.  "
"304","Genesis","12","5","He took his wife Sarai, his nephew Lot, all the possessions they had accumulated and the people they had acquired in Harran, and they set out for the land of Canaan, and they arrived there. "
"305","Genesis","12","6","Abram traveled through the land as far as the site of the great tree of Moreh at Shechem. At that time the Canaanites were in the land.  "
"306","Genesis","12","7","The  Lord  appeared to Abram and said, “To your offspring  I will give this land.” So he built an altar there to the  Lord , who had appeared to him. "
"307","Genesis","12","8","From there he went on toward the hills east of Bethel and pitched his tent, with Bethel on the west and Ai on the east. There he built an altar to the  Lord  and called on the name of the  Lord . "
"308","Genesis","12","9","Then Abram set out and continued toward the Negev. "
"309","Genesis","12","10","Now there was a famine in the land, and Abram went down to Egypt to live there for a while because the famine was severe.  "
"310","Genesis","12","11","As he was about to enter Egypt, he said to his wife Sarai, “I know what a beautiful woman you are.  "
"311","Genesis","12","12","When the Egyptians see you, they will say, ‘This is his wife.’ Then they will kill me but will let you live.  "
"312","Genesis","12","13","Say you are my sister, so that I will be treated well for your sake and my life will be spared because of you.” "
"313","Genesis","12","14","When Abram came to Egypt, the Egyptians saw that Sarai was a very beautiful woman.  "
"314","Genesis","12","15","And when Pharaoh’s officials saw her, they praised her to Pharaoh, and she was taken into his palace.  "
"315","Genesis","12","16","He treated Abram well for her sake, and Abram acquired sheep and cattle, male and female donkeys, male and female servants, and camels. "
"316","Genesis","12","17","But the  Lord  inflicted serious diseases on Pharaoh and his household because of Abram’s wife Sarai.  "
"317","Genesis","12","18","So Pharaoh summoned Abram. “What have you done to me?” he said. “Why didn’t you tell me she was your wife?  "
"318","Genesis","12","19","Why did you say, ‘She is my sister,’ so that I took her to be my wife? Now then, here is your wife. Take her and go!”  "
"319","Genesis","12","20","Then Pharaoh gave orders about Abram to his men, and they sent him on his way, with his wife and everything he had."
"320","Genesis","13","1","So Abram went up from Egypt to the Negev, with his wife and everything he had, and Lot went with him.  "
"321","Genesis","13","2","Abram had become very wealthy in livestock and in silver and gold. "
"322","Genesis","13","3","From the Negev he went from place to place until he came to Bethel, to the place between Bethel and Ai where his tent had been earlier  "
"323","Genesis","13","4","and where he had first built an altar. There Abram called on the name of the  Lord . "
"324","Genesis","13","5","Now Lot, who was moving about with Abram, also had flocks and herds and tents.  "
"325","Genesis","13","6","But the land could not support them while they stayed together, for their possessions were so great that they were not able to stay together.  "
"326","Genesis","13","7","And quarreling arose between Abram’s herders and Lot’s. The Canaanites and Perizzites were also living in the land at that time. "
"327","Genesis","13","8","So Abram said to Lot, “Let’s not have any quarreling between you and me, or between your herders and mine, for we are close relatives.  "
"328","Genesis","13","9","Is not the whole land before you? Let’s part company. If you go to the left, I’ll go to the right; if you go to the right, I’ll go to the left.” "
"329","Genesis","13","10","Lot looked around and saw that the whole plain of the Jordan toward Zoar was well watered, like the garden of the  Lord , like the land of Egypt. (This was before the  Lord  destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah.)  "
"330","Genesis","13","11","So Lot chose for himself the whole plain of the Jordan and set out toward the east. The two men parted company:  "
"331","Genesis","13","12","Abram lived in the land of Canaan, while Lot lived among the cities of the plain and pitched his tents near Sodom.  "
"332","Genesis","13","13","Now the people of Sodom were wicked and were sinning greatly against the  Lord . "
"333","Genesis","13","14","The  Lord  said to Abram after Lot had parted from him, “Look around from where you are, to the north and south, to the east and west.  "
"334","Genesis","13","15","All the land that you see I will give to you and your offspring  forever.  "
"335","Genesis","13","16","I will make your offspring like the dust of the earth, so that if anyone could count the dust, then your offspring could be counted.  "
"336","Genesis","13","17","Go, walk through the length and breadth of the land, for I am giving it to you.” "
"337","Genesis","13","18","So Abram went to live near the great trees of Mamre at Hebron, where he pitched his tents. There he built an altar to the  Lord ."
"338","Genesis","14","1","At the time when Amraphel was king of Shinar,  Arioch king of Ellasar, Kedorlaomer king of Elam and Tidal king of Goyim,  "
"339","Genesis","14","2","these kings went to war against Bera king of Sodom, Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, Shemeber king of Zeboyim, and the king of Bela (that is, Zoar).  "
"340","Genesis","14","3","All these latter kings joined forces in the Valley of Siddim (that is, the Dead Sea Valley).  "
"341","Genesis","14","4","For twelve years they had been subject to Kedorlaomer, but in the thirteenth year they rebelled. "
"342","Genesis","14","5","In the fourteenth year, Kedorlaomer and the kings allied with him went out and defeated the Rephaites in Ashteroth Karnaim, the Zuzites in Ham, the Emites in Shaveh Kiriathaim  "
"343","Genesis","14","6","and the Horites in the hill country of Seir, as far as El Paran near the desert.  "
"344","Genesis","14","7","Then they turned back and went to En Mishpat (that is, Kadesh), and they conquered the whole territory of the Amalekites, as well as the Amorites who were living in Hazezon Tamar. "
"345","Genesis","14","8","Then the king of Sodom, the king of Gomorrah, the king of Admah, the king of Zeboyim and the king of Bela (that is, Zoar) marched out and drew up their battle lines in the Valley of Siddim  "
"346","Genesis","14","9","against Kedorlaomer king of Elam, Tidal king of Goyim, Amraphel king of Shinar and Arioch king of Ellasar—four kings against five.  "
"347","Genesis","14","10","Now the Valley of Siddim was full of tar pits, and when the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, some of the men fell into them and the rest fled to the hills.  "
"348","Genesis","14","11","The four kings seized all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah and all their food; then they went away.  "
"349","Genesis","14","12","They also carried off Abram’s nephew Lot and his possessions, since he was living in Sodom. "
"350","Genesis","14","13","A man who had escaped came and reported this to Abram the Hebrew. Now Abram was living near the great trees of Mamre the Amorite, a brother  of Eshkol and Aner, all of whom were allied with Abram.  "
"351","Genesis","14","14","When Abram heard that his relative had been taken captive, he called out the 318 trained men born in his household and went in pursuit as far as Dan.  "
"352","Genesis","14","15","During the night Abram divided his men to attack them and he routed them, pursuing them as far as Hobah, north of Damascus.  "
"353","Genesis","14","16","He recovered all the goods and brought back his relative Lot and his possessions, together with the women and the other people. "
"354","Genesis","14","17","After Abram returned from defeating Kedorlaomer and the kings allied with him, the king of Sodom came out to meet him in the Valley of Shaveh (that is, the King’s Valley). "
"355","Genesis","14","18","Then Melchizedek king of Salem brought out bread and wine. He was priest of God Most High,  "
"356","Genesis","14","19","and he blessed Abram, saying, “Blessed be Abram by God Most High, Creator of heaven and earth. "
"357","Genesis","14","20","And praise be to God Most High, who delivered your enemies into your hand.” Then Abram gave him a tenth of everything. "
"358","Genesis","14","21","The king of Sodom said to Abram, “Give me the people and keep the goods for yourself.” "
"359","Genesis","14","22","But Abram said to the king of Sodom, “With raised hand I have sworn an oath to the  Lord , God Most High, Creator of heaven and earth,  "
"360","Genesis","14","23","that I will accept nothing belonging to you, not even a thread or the strap of a sandal, so that you will never be able to say, ‘I made Abram rich.’  "
"361","Genesis","14","24","I will accept nothing but what my men have eaten and the share that belongs to the men who went with me—to Aner, Eshkol and Mamre. Let them have their share.”"
"362","Genesis","15","1","After this, the word of the  Lord  came to Abram in a vision: “Do not be afraid, Abram. I am your shield, your very great reward. ” "
"363","Genesis","15","2","But Abram said, “Sovereign  Lord , what can you give me since I remain childless and the one who will inherit  my estate is Eliezer of Damascus?”  "
"364","Genesis","15","3","And Abram said, “You have given me no children; so a servant in my household will be my heir.” "
"365","Genesis","15","4","Then the word of the  Lord  came to him: “This man will not be your heir, but a son who is your own flesh and blood will be your heir.”  "
"366","Genesis","15","5","He took him outside and said, “Look up at the sky and count the stars—if indeed you can count them.” Then he said to him, “So shall your offspring  be.” "
"367","Genesis","15","6","Abram believed the  Lord , and he credited it to him as righteousness. "
"368","Genesis","15","7","He also said to him, “I am the  Lord , who brought you out of Ur of the Chaldeans to give you this land to take possession of it.” "
"369","Genesis","15","8","But Abram said, “Sovereign  Lord , how can I know that I will gain possession of it?” "
"370","Genesis","15","9","So the  Lord  said to him, “Bring me a heifer, a goat and a ram, each three years old, along with a dove and a young pigeon.” "
"371","Genesis","15","10","Abram brought all these to him, cut them in two and arranged the halves opposite each other; the birds, however, he did not cut in half.  "
"372","Genesis","15","11","Then birds of prey came down on the carcasses, but Abram drove them away. "
"373","Genesis","15","12","As the sun was setting, Abram fell into a deep sleep, and a thick and dreadful darkness came over him.  "
"374","Genesis","15","13","Then the  Lord  said to him, “Know for certain that for four hundred years your descendants will be strangers in a country not their own and that they will be enslaved and mistreated there.  "
"375","Genesis","15","14","But I will punish the nation they serve as slaves, and afterward they will come out with great possessions.  "
"376","Genesis","15","15","You, however, will go to your ancestors in peace and be buried at a good old age.  "
"377","Genesis","15","16","In the fourth generation your descendants will come back here, for the sin of the Amorites has not yet reached its full measure.” "
"378","Genesis","15","17","When the sun had set and darkness had fallen, a smoking firepot with a blazing torch appeared and passed between the pieces.  "
"379","Genesis","15","18","On that day the  Lord  made a covenant with Abram and said, “To your descendants I give this land, from the Wadi  of Egypt to the great river, the Euphrates—  "
"380","Genesis","15","19","the land of the Kenites, Kenizzites, Kadmonites,  "
"381","Genesis","15","20","Hittites, Perizzites, Rephaites,  "
"382","Genesis","15","21","Amorites, Canaanites, Girgashites and Jebusites.”"
"383","Genesis","16","1","Now Sarai, Abram’s wife, had borne him no children. But she had an Egyptian slave named Hagar;  "
"384","Genesis","16","2","so she said to Abram, “The  Lord  has kept me from having children. Go, sleep with my slave; perhaps I can build a family through her.” Abram agreed to what Sarai said.  "
"385","Genesis","16","3","So after Abram had been living in Canaan ten years, Sarai his wife took her Egyptian slave Hagar and gave her to her husband to be his wife.  "
"386","Genesis","16","4","He slept with Hagar, and she conceived. When she knew she was pregnant, she began to despise her mistress.  "
"387","Genesis","16","5","Then Sarai said to Abram, “You are responsible for the wrong I am suffering. I put my slave in your arms, and now that she knows she is pregnant, she despises me. May the  Lord  judge between you and me.” "
"388","Genesis","16","6","“Your slave is in your hands,” Abram said. “Do with her whatever you think best.” Then Sarai mistreated Hagar; so she fled from her. "
"389","Genesis","16","7","The angel of the  Lord  found Hagar near a spring in the desert; it was the spring that is beside the road to Shur.  "
"390","Genesis","16","8","And he said, “Hagar, slave of Sarai, where have you come from, and where are you going?” “I’m running away from my mistress Sarai,” she answered. "
"391","Genesis","16","9","Then the angel of the  Lord  told her, “Go back to your mistress and submit to her.”  "
"392","Genesis","16","10","The angel added, “I will increase your descendants so much that they will be too numerous to count.” "
"393","Genesis","16","11","The angel of the  Lord  also said to her: “You are now pregnant and you will give birth to a son. You shall name him Ishmael, for the  Lord  has heard of your misery. "
"394","Genesis","16","12","He will be a wild donkey of a man; his hand will be against everyone and everyone’s hand against him, and he will live in hostility toward  all his brothers.” "
"395","Genesis","16","13","She gave this name to the  Lord  who spoke to her: “You are the God who sees me,” for she said, “I have now seen  the One who sees me.”  "
"396","Genesis","16","14","That is why the well was called Beer Lahai Roi ; it is still there, between Kadesh and Bered. "
"397","Genesis","16","15","So Hagar bore Abram a son, and Abram gave the name Ishmael to the son she had borne.  "
"398","Genesis","16","16","Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore him Ishmael."
"399","Genesis","17","1","When Abram was ninety-nine years old, the  Lord  appeared to him and said, “I am God Almighty ; walk before me faithfully and be blameless.  "
"400","Genesis","17","2","Then I will make my covenant between me and you and will greatly increase your numbers.” "
"401","Genesis","17","3","Abram fell facedown, and God said to him,  "
"402","Genesis","17","4","“As for me, this is my covenant with you: You will be the father of many nations.  "
"403","Genesis","17","5","No longer will you be called Abram ; your name will be Abraham,  for I have made you a father of many nations.  "
"404","Genesis","17","6","I will make you very fruitful; I will make nations of you, and kings will come from you.  "
"405","Genesis","17","7","I will establish my covenant as an everlasting covenant between me and you and your descendants after you for the generations to come, to be your God and the God of your descendants after you.  "
"406","Genesis","17","8","The whole land of Canaan, where you now reside as a foreigner, I will give as an everlasting possession to you and your descendants after you; and I will be their God.” "
"407","Genesis","17","9","Then God said to Abraham, “As for you, you must keep my covenant, you and your descendants after you for the generations to come.  "
"408","Genesis","17","10","This is my covenant with you and your descendants after you, the covenant you are to keep: Every male among you shall be circumcised.  "
"409","Genesis","17","11","You are to undergo circumcision, and it will be the sign of the covenant between me and you.  "
"410","Genesis","17","12","For the generations to come every male among you who is eight days old must be circumcised, including those born in your household or bought with money from a foreigner—those who are not your offspring.  "
"411","Genesis","17","13","Whether born in your household or bought with your money, they must be circumcised. My covenant in your flesh is to be an everlasting covenant.  "
"412","Genesis","17","14","Any uncircumcised male, who has not been circumcised in the flesh, will be cut off from his people; he has broken my covenant.” "
"413","Genesis","17","15","God also said to Abraham, “As for Sarai your wife, you are no longer to call her Sarai; her name will be Sarah.  "
"414","Genesis","17","16","I will bless her and will surely give you a son by her. I will bless her so that she will be the mother of nations; kings of peoples will come from her.” "
"415","Genesis","17","17","Abraham fell facedown; he laughed and said to himself, “Will a son be born to a man a hundred years old? Will Sarah bear a child at the age of ninety?”  "
"416","Genesis","17","18","And Abraham said to God, “If only Ishmael might live under your blessing!” "
"417","Genesis","17","19","Then God said, “Yes, but your wife Sarah will bear you a son, and you will call him Isaac.  I will establish my covenant with him as an everlasting covenant for his descendants after him.  "
"418","Genesis","17","20","And as for Ishmael, I have heard you: I will surely bless him; I will make him fruitful and will greatly increase his numbers. He will be the father of twelve rulers, and I will make him into a great nation.  "
"419","Genesis","17","21","But my covenant I will establish with Isaac, whom Sarah will bear to you by this time next year.”  "
"420","Genesis","17","22","When he had finished speaking with Abraham, God went up from him. "
"421","Genesis","17","23","On that very day Abraham took his son Ishmael and all those born in his household or bought with his money, every male in his household, and circumcised them, as God told him.  "
"422","Genesis","17","24","Abraham was ninety-nine years old when he was circumcised,  "
"423","Genesis","17","25","and his son Ishmael was thirteen;  "
"424","Genesis","17","26","Abraham and his son Ishmael were both circumcised on that very day.  "
"425","Genesis","17","27","And every male in Abraham’s household, including those born in his household or bought from a foreigner, was circumcised with him."
"426","Genesis","18","1","The  Lord  appeared to Abraham near the great trees of Mamre while he was sitting at the entrance to his tent in the heat of the day.  "
"427","Genesis","18","2","Abraham looked up and saw three men standing nearby. When he saw them, he hurried from the entrance of his tent to meet them and bowed low to the ground. "
"428","Genesis","18","3","He said, “If I have found favor in your eyes, my lord,  do not pass your servant by.  "
"429","Genesis","18","4","Let a little water be brought, and then you may all wash your feet and rest under this tree.  "
"430","Genesis","18","5","Let me get you something to eat, so you can be refreshed and then go on your way—now that you have come to your servant.” “Very well,” they answered, “do as you say.” "
"431","Genesis","18","6","So Abraham hurried into the tent to Sarah. “Quick,” he said, “get three seahs  of the finest flour and knead it and bake some bread.” "
"432","Genesis","18","7","Then he ran to the herd and selected a choice, tender calf and gave it to a servant, who hurried to prepare it.  "
"433","Genesis","18","8","He then brought some curds and milk and the calf that had been prepared, and set these before them. While they ate, he stood near them under a tree. "
"434","Genesis","18","9","“Where is your wife Sarah?” they asked him. “There, in the tent,” he said. "
"435","Genesis","18","10","Then one of them said, “I will surely return to you about this time next year, and Sarah your wife will have a son.” Now Sarah was listening at the entrance to the tent, which was behind him.  "
"436","Genesis","18","11","Abraham and Sarah were already very old, and Sarah was past the age of childbearing.  "
"437","Genesis","18","12","So Sarah laughed to herself as she thought, “After I am worn out and my lord is old, will I now have this pleasure?” "
"438","Genesis","18","13","Then the  Lord  said to Abraham, “Why did Sarah laugh and say, ‘Will I really have a child, now that I am old?’  "
"439","Genesis","18","14","Is anything too hard for the  Lord ? I will return to you at the appointed time next year, and Sarah will have a son.” "
"440","Genesis","18","15","Sarah was afraid, so she lied and said, “I did not laugh.” But he said, “Yes, you did laugh.” "
"441","Genesis","18","16","When the men got up to leave, they looked down toward Sodom, and Abraham walked along with them to see them on their way.  "
"442","Genesis","18","17","Then the  Lord  said, “Shall I hide from Abraham what I am about to do?  "
"443","Genesis","18","18","Abraham will surely become a great and powerful nation, and all nations on earth will be blessed through him.   "
"444","Genesis","18","19","For I have chosen him, so that he will direct his children and his household after him to keep the way of the  Lord  by doing what is right and just, so that the  Lord  will bring about for Abraham what he has promised him.” "
"445","Genesis","18","20","Then the  Lord  said, “The outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is so great and their sin so grievous  "
"446","Genesis","18","21","that I will go down and see if what they have done is as bad as the outcry that has reached me. If not, I will know.” "
"447","Genesis","18","22","The men turned away and went toward Sodom, but Abraham remained standing before the  Lord .   "
"448","Genesis","18","23","Then Abraham approached him and said: “Will you sweep away the righteous with the wicked?  "
"449","Genesis","18","24","What if there are fifty righteous people in the city? Will you really sweep it away and not spare  the place for the sake of the fifty righteous people in it?  "
"450","Genesis","18","25","Far be it from you to do such a thing—to kill the righteous with the wicked, treating the righteous and the wicked alike. Far be it from you! Will not the Judge of all the earth do right?” "
"451","Genesis","18","26","The  Lord  said, “If I find fifty righteous people in the city of Sodom, I will spare the whole place for their sake.” "
"452","Genesis","18","27","Then Abraham spoke up again: “Now that I have been so bold as to speak to the Lord, though I am nothing but dust and ashes,  "
"453","Genesis","18","28","what if the number of the righteous is five less than fifty? Will you destroy the whole city for lack of five people?” “If I find forty-five there,” he said, “I will not destroy it.” "
"454","Genesis","18","29","Once again he spoke to him, “What if only forty are found there?” He said, “For the sake of forty, I will not do it.” "
"455","Genesis","18","30","Then he said, “May the Lord not be angry, but let me speak. What if only thirty can be found there?” He answered, “I will not do it if I find thirty there.” "
"456","Genesis","18","31","Abraham said, “Now that I have been so bold as to speak to the Lord, what if only twenty can be found there?” He said, “For the sake of twenty, I will not destroy it.” "
"457","Genesis","18","32","Then he said, “May the Lord not be angry, but let me speak just once more. What if only ten can be found there?” He answered, “For the sake of ten, I will not destroy it.” "
"458","Genesis","18","33","When the  Lord  had finished speaking with Abraham, he left, and Abraham returned home."
"459","Genesis","19","1","The two angels arrived at Sodom in the evening, and Lot was sitting in the gateway of the city. When he saw them, he got up to meet them and bowed down with his face to the ground.  "
"460","Genesis","19","2","“My lords,” he said, “please turn aside to your servant’s house. You can wash your feet and spend the night and then go on your way early in the morning.” “No,” they answered, “we will spend the night in the square.” "
"461","Genesis","19","3","But he insisted so strongly that they did go with him and entered his house. He prepared a meal for them, baking bread without yeast, and they ate.  "
"462","Genesis","19","4","Before they had gone to bed, all the men from every part of the city of Sodom—both young and old—surrounded the house.  "
"463","Genesis","19","5","They called to Lot, “Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us so that we can have sex with them.” "
"464","Genesis","19","6","Lot went outside to meet them and shut the door behind him  "
"465","Genesis","19","7","and said, “No, my friends. Don’t do this wicked thing.  "
"466","Genesis","19","8","Look, I have two daughters who have never slept with a man. Let me bring them out to you, and you can do what you like with them. But don’t do anything to these men, for they have come under the protection of my roof.” "
"467","Genesis","19","9","“Get out of our way,” they replied. “This fellow came here as a foreigner, and now he wants to play the judge! We’ll treat you worse than them.” They kept bringing pressure on Lot and moved forward to break down the door. "
"468","Genesis","19","10","But the men inside reached out and pulled Lot back into the house and shut the door.  "
"469","Genesis","19","11","Then they struck the men who were at the door of the house, young and old, with blindness so that they could not find the door. "
"470","Genesis","19","12","The two men said to Lot, “Do you have anyone else here—sons-in-law, sons or daughters, or anyone else in the city who belongs to you? Get them out of here,  "
"471","Genesis","19","13","because we are going to destroy this place. The outcry to the  Lord  against its people is so great that he has sent us to destroy it.” "
"472","Genesis","19","14","So Lot went out and spoke to his sons-in-law, who were pledged to marry  his daughters. He said, “Hurry and get out of this place, because the  Lord  is about to destroy the city!” But his sons-in-law thought he was joking. "
"473","Genesis","19","15","With the coming of dawn, the angels urged Lot, saying, “Hurry! Take your wife and your two daughters who are here, or you will be swept away when the city is punished.” "
"474","Genesis","19","16","When he hesitated, the men grasped his hand and the hands of his wife and of his two daughters and led them safely out of the city, for the  Lord  was merciful to them.  "
"475","Genesis","19","17","As soon as they had brought them out, one of them said, “Flee for your lives! Don’t look back, and don’t stop anywhere in the plain! Flee to the mountains or you will be swept away!” "
"476","Genesis","19","18","But Lot said to them, “No, my lords,  please!  "
"477","Genesis","19","19","Your  servant has found favor in your  eyes, and you  have shown great kindness to me in sparing my life. But I can’t flee to the mountains; this disaster will overtake me, and I’ll die.  "
"478","Genesis","19","20","Look, here is a town near enough to run to, and it is small. Let me flee to it—it is very small, isn’t it? Then my life will be spared.” "
"479","Genesis","19","21","He said to him, “Very well, I will grant this request too; I will not overthrow the town you speak of.  "
"480","Genesis","19","22","But flee there quickly, because I cannot do anything until you reach it.” (That is why the town was called Zoar. ) "
"481","Genesis","19","23","By the time Lot reached Zoar, the sun had risen over the land.  "
"482","Genesis","19","24","Then the  Lord  rained down burning sulfur on Sodom and Gomorrah—from the  Lord  out of the heavens.  "
"483","Genesis","19","25","Thus he overthrew those cities and the entire plain, destroying all those living in the cities—and also the vegetation in the land.  "
"484","Genesis","19","26","But Lot’s wife looked back, and she became a pillar of salt. "
"485","Genesis","19","27","Early the next morning Abraham got up and returned to the place where he had stood before the  Lord .  "
"486","Genesis","19","28","He looked down toward Sodom and Gomorrah, toward all the land of the plain, and he saw dense smoke rising from the land, like smoke from a furnace. "
"487","Genesis","19","29","So when God destroyed the cities of the plain, he remembered Abraham, and he brought Lot out of the catastrophe that overthrew the cities where Lot had lived. "
"488","Genesis","19","30","Lot and his two daughters left Zoar and settled in the mountains, for he was afraid to stay in Zoar. He and his two daughters lived in a cave.  "
"489","Genesis","19","31","One day the older daughter said to the younger, “Our father is old, and there is no man around here to give us children—as is the custom all over the earth.  "
"490","Genesis","19","32","Let’s get our father to drink wine and then sleep with him and preserve our family line through our father.” "
"491","Genesis","19","33","That night they got their father to drink wine, and the older daughter went in and slept with him. He was not aware of it when she lay down or when she got up. "
"492","Genesis","19","34","The next day the older daughter said to the younger, “Last night I slept with my father. Let’s get him to drink wine again tonight, and you go in and sleep with him so we can preserve our family line through our father.”  "
"493","Genesis","19","35","So they got their father to drink wine that night also, and the younger daughter went in and slept with him. Again he was not aware of it when she lay down or when she got up. "
"494","Genesis","19","36","So both of Lot’s daughters became pregnant by their father.  "
"495","Genesis","19","37","The older daughter had a son, and she named him Moab ; he is the father of the Moabites of today.  "
"496","Genesis","19","38","The younger daughter also had a son, and she named him Ben-Ammi ; he is the father of the Ammonites  of today."
"497","Genesis","20","1","Now Abraham moved on from there into the region of the Negev and lived between Kadesh and Shur. For a while he stayed in Gerar,  "
"498","Genesis","20","2","and there Abraham said of his wife Sarah, “She is my sister.” Then Abimelek king of Gerar sent for Sarah and took her. "
"499","Genesis","20","3","But God came to Abimelek in a dream one night and said to him, “You are as good as dead because of the woman you have taken; she is a married woman.” "
"500","Genesis","20","4","Now Abimelek had not gone near her, so he said, “Lord, will you destroy an innocent nation?  "
"501","Genesis","20","5","Did he not say to me, ‘She is my sister,’ and didn’t she also say, ‘He is my brother’? I have done this with a clear conscience and clean hands.” "
"502","Genesis","20","6","Then God said to him in the dream, “Yes, I know you did this with a clear conscience, and so I have kept you from sinning against me. That is why I did not let you touch her.  "
"503","Genesis","20","7","Now return the man’s wife, for he is a prophet, and he will pray for you and you will live. But if you do not return her, you may be sure that you and all who belong to you will die.” "
"504","Genesis","20","8","Early the next morning Abimelek summoned all his officials, and when he told them all that had happened, they were very much afraid.  "
"505","Genesis","20","9","Then Abimelek called Abraham in and said, “What have you done to us? How have I wronged you that you have brought such great guilt upon me and my kingdom? You have done things to me that should never be done.”  "
"506","Genesis","20","10","And Abimelek asked Abraham, “What was your reason for doing this?” "
"507","Genesis","20","11","Abraham replied, “I said to myself, ‘There is surely no fear of God in this place, and they will kill me because of my wife.’  "
"508","Genesis","20","12","Besides, she really is my sister, the daughter of my father though not of my mother; and she became my wife.  "
"509","Genesis","20","13","And when God had me wander from my father’s household, I said to her, ‘This is how you can show your love to me: Everywhere we go, say of me, “He is my brother.” ’ ” "
"510","Genesis","20","14","Then Abimelek brought sheep and cattle and male and female slaves and gave them to Abraham, and he returned Sarah his wife to him.  "
"511","Genesis","20","15","And Abimelek said, “My land is before you; live wherever you like.” "
"512","Genesis","20","16","To Sarah he said, “I am giving your brother a thousand shekels  of silver. This is to cover the offense against you before all who are with you; you are completely vindicated.” "
"513","Genesis","20","17","Then Abraham prayed to God, and God healed Abimelek, his wife and his female slaves so they could have children again,  "
"514","Genesis","20","18","for the  Lord  had kept all the women in Abimelek’s household from conceiving because of Abraham’s wife Sarah."
"515","Genesis","21","1","Now the  Lord  was gracious to Sarah as he had said, and the  Lord  did for Sarah what he had promised.  "
"516","Genesis","21","2","Sarah became pregnant and bore a son to Abraham in his old age, at the very time God had promised him.  "
"517","Genesis","21","3","Abraham gave the name Isaac  to the son Sarah bore him.  "
"518","Genesis","21","4","When his son Isaac was eight days old, Abraham circumcised him, as God commanded him.  "
"519","Genesis","21","5","Abraham was a hundred years old when his son Isaac was born to him. "
"520","Genesis","21","6","Sarah said, “God has brought me laughter, and everyone who hears about this will laugh with me.”  "
"521","Genesis","21","7","And she added, “Who would have said to Abraham that Sarah would nurse children? Yet I have borne him a son in his old age.” "
"522","Genesis","21","8","The child grew and was weaned, and on the day Isaac was weaned Abraham held a great feast.  "
"523","Genesis","21","9","But Sarah saw that the son whom Hagar the Egyptian had borne to Abraham was mocking,  "
"524","Genesis","21","10","and she said to Abraham, “Get rid of that slave woman and her son, for that woman’s son will never share in the inheritance with my son Isaac.” "
"525","Genesis","21","11","The matter distressed Abraham greatly because it concerned his son.  "
"526","Genesis","21","12","But God said to him, “Do not be so distressed about the boy and your slave woman. Listen to whatever Sarah tells you, because it is through Isaac that your offspring  will be reckoned.  "
"527","Genesis","21","13","I will make the son of the slave into a nation also, because he is your offspring.” "
"528","Genesis","21","14","Early the next morning Abraham took some food and a skin of water and gave them to Hagar. He set them on her shoulders and then sent her off with the boy. She went on her way and wandered in the Desert of Beersheba. "
"529","Genesis","21","15","When the water in the skin was gone, she put the boy under one of the bushes.  "
"530","Genesis","21","16","Then she went off and sat down about a bowshot away, for she thought, “I cannot watch the boy die.” And as she sat there, she  began to sob. "
"531","Genesis","21","17","God heard the boy crying, and the angel of God called to Hagar from heaven and said to her, “What is the matter, Hagar? Do not be afraid; God has heard the boy crying as he lies there.  "
"532","Genesis","21","18","Lift the boy up and take him by the hand, for I will make him into a great nation.” "
"533","Genesis","21","19","Then God opened her eyes and she saw a well of water. So she went and filled the skin with water and gave the boy a drink. "
"534","Genesis","21","20","God was with the boy as he grew up. He lived in the desert and became an archer.  "
"535","Genesis","21","21","While he was living in the Desert of Paran, his mother got a wife for him from Egypt. "
"536","Genesis","21","22","At that time Abimelek and Phicol the commander of his forces said to Abraham, “God is with you in everything you do.  "
"537","Genesis","21","23","Now swear to me here before God that you will not deal falsely with me or my children or my descendants. Show to me and the country where you now reside as a foreigner the same kindness I have shown to you.” "
"538","Genesis","21","24","Abraham said, “I swear it.” "
"539","Genesis","21","25","Then Abraham complained to Abimelek about a well of water that Abimelek’s servants had seized.  "
"540","Genesis","21","26","But Abimelek said, “I don’t know who has done this. You did not tell me, and I heard about it only today.” "
"541","Genesis","21","27","So Abraham brought sheep and cattle and gave them to Abimelek, and the two men made a treaty.  "
"542","Genesis","21","28","Abraham set apart seven ewe lambs from the flock,  "
"543","Genesis","21","29","and Abimelek asked Abraham, “What is the meaning of these seven ewe lambs you have set apart by themselves?” "
"544","Genesis","21","30","He replied, “Accept these seven lambs from my hand as a witness that I dug this well.” "
"545","Genesis","21","31","So that place was called Beersheba,  because the two men swore an oath there. "
"546","Genesis","21","32","After the treaty had been made at Beersheba, Abimelek and Phicol the commander of his forces returned to the land of the Philistines.  "
"547","Genesis","21","33","Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beersheba, and there he called on the name of the  Lord , the Eternal God.  "
"548","Genesis","21","34","And Abraham stayed in the land of the Philistines for a long time."
"549","Genesis","22","1","Some time later God tested Abraham. He said to him, “Abraham!” “Here I am,” he replied. "
"550","Genesis","22","2","Then God said, “Take your son, your only son, whom you love—Isaac—and go to the region of Moriah. Sacrifice him there as a burnt offering on a mountain I will show you.” "
"551","Genesis","22","3","Early the next morning Abraham got up and loaded his donkey. He took with him two of his servants and his son Isaac. When he had cut enough wood for the burnt offering, he set out for the place God had told him about.  "
"552","Genesis","22","4","On the third day Abraham looked up and saw the place in the distance.  "
"553","Genesis","22","5","He said to his servants, “Stay here with the donkey while I and the boy go over there. We will worship and then we will come back to you.” "
"554","Genesis","22","6","Abraham took the wood for the burnt offering and placed it on his son Isaac, and he himself carried the fire and the knife. As the two of them went on together,  "
"555","Genesis","22","7","Isaac spoke up and said to his father Abraham, “Father?” “Yes, my son?” Abraham replied. “The fire and wood are here,” Isaac said, “but where is the lamb for the burnt offering?” "
"556","Genesis","22","8","Abraham answered, “God himself will provide the lamb for the burnt offering, my son.” And the two of them went on together. "
"557","Genesis","22","9","When they reached the place God had told him about, Abraham built an altar there and arranged the wood on it. He bound his son Isaac and laid him on the altar, on top of the wood.  "
"558","Genesis","22","10","Then he reached out his hand and took the knife to slay his son.  "
"559","Genesis","22","11","But the angel of the  Lord  called out to him from heaven, “Abraham! Abraham!” “Here I am,” he replied. "
"560","Genesis","22","12","“Do not lay a hand on the boy,” he said. “Do not do anything to him. Now I know that you fear God, because you have not withheld from me your son, your only son.” "
"561","Genesis","22","13","Abraham looked up and there in a thicket he saw a ram  caught by its horns. He went over and took the ram and sacrificed it as a burnt offering instead of his son.  "
"562","Genesis","22","14","So Abraham called that place The  Lord  Will Provide. And to this day it is said, “On the mountain of the  Lord  it will be provided.” "
"563","Genesis","22","15","The angel of the  Lord  called to Abraham from heaven a second time  "
"564","Genesis","22","16","and said, “I swear by myself, declares the  Lord , that because you have done this and have not withheld your son, your only son,  "
"565","Genesis","22","17","I will surely bless you and make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and as the sand on the seashore. Your descendants will take possession of the cities of their enemies,  "
"566","Genesis","22","18","and through your offspring  all nations on earth will be blessed,  because you have obeyed me.” "
"567","Genesis","22","19","Then Abraham returned to his servants, and they set off together for Beersheba. And Abraham stayed in Beersheba. "
"568","Genesis","22","20","Some time later Abraham was told, “Milkah is also a mother; she has borne sons to your brother Nahor:  "
"569","Genesis","22","21","Uz the firstborn, Buz his brother, Kemuel (the father of Aram),  "
"570","Genesis","22","22","Kesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph and Bethuel.”  "
"571","Genesis","22","23","Bethuel became the father of Rebekah. Milkah bore these eight sons to Abraham’s brother Nahor.  "
"572","Genesis","22","24","His concubine, whose name was Reumah, also had sons: Tebah, Gaham, Tahash and Maakah."
"573","Genesis","23","1","Sarah lived to be a hundred and twenty-seven years old.  "
"574","Genesis","23","2","She died at Kiriath Arba (that is, Hebron) in the land of Canaan, and Abraham went to mourn for Sarah and to weep over her. "
"575","Genesis","23","3","Then Abraham rose from beside his dead wife and spoke to the Hittites.  He said,  "
"576","Genesis","23","4","“I am a foreigner and stranger among you. Sell me some property for a burial site here so I can bury my dead.” "
"577","Genesis","23","5","The Hittites replied to Abraham,  "
"578","Genesis","23","6","“Sir, listen to us. You are a mighty prince among us. Bury your dead in the choicest of our tombs. None of us will refuse you his tomb for burying your dead.” "
"579","Genesis","23","7","Then Abraham rose and bowed down before the people of the land, the Hittites.  "
"580","Genesis","23","8","He said to them, “If you are willing to let me bury my dead, then listen to me and intercede with Ephron son of Zohar on my behalf  "
"581","Genesis","23","9","so he will sell me the cave of Machpelah, which belongs to him and is at the end of his field. Ask him to sell it to me for the full price as a burial site among you.” "
"582","Genesis","23","10","Ephron the Hittite was sitting among his people and he replied to Abraham in the hearing of all the Hittites who had come to the gate of his city.  "
"583","Genesis","23","11","“No, my lord,” he said. “Listen to me; I give  you the field, and I give  you the cave that is in it. I give  it to you in the presence of my people. Bury your dead.” "
"584","Genesis","23","12","Again Abraham bowed down before the people of the land  "
"585","Genesis","23","13","and he said to Ephron in their hearing, “Listen to me, if you will. I will pay the price of the field. Accept it from me so I can bury my dead there.” "
"586","Genesis","23","14","Ephron answered Abraham,  "
"587","Genesis","23","15","“Listen to me, my lord; the land is worth four hundred shekels  of silver, but what is that between you and me? Bury your dead.” "
"588","Genesis","23","16","Abraham agreed to Ephron’s terms and weighed out for him the price he had named in the hearing of the Hittites: four hundred shekels of silver, according to the weight current among the merchants. "
"589","Genesis","23","17","So Ephron’s field in Machpelah near Mamre—both the field and the cave in it, and all the trees within the borders of the field—was deeded  "
"590","Genesis","23","18","to Abraham as his property in the presence of all the Hittites who had come to the gate of the city.  "
"591","Genesis","23","19","Afterward Abraham buried his wife Sarah in the cave in the field of Machpelah near Mamre (which is at Hebron) in the land of Canaan.  "
"592","Genesis","23","20","So the field and the cave in it were deeded to Abraham by the Hittites as a burial site."
"593","Genesis","24","1","Abraham was now very old, and the  Lord  had blessed him in every way.  "
"594","Genesis","24","2","He said to the senior servant in his household, the one in charge of all that he had, “Put your hand under my thigh.  "
"595","Genesis","24","3","I want you to swear by the  Lord , the God of heaven and the God of earth, that you will not get a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I am living,  "
"596","Genesis","24","4","but will go to my country and my own relatives and get a wife for my son Isaac.” "
"597","Genesis","24","5","The servant asked him, “What if the woman is unwilling to come back with me to this land? Shall I then take your son back to the country you came from?” "
"598","Genesis","24","6","“Make sure that you do not take my son back there,” Abraham said.  "
"599","Genesis","24","7","“The  Lord , the God of heaven, who brought me out of my father’s household and my native land and who spoke to me and promised me on oath, saying, ‘To your offspring  I will give this land’—he will send his angel before you so that you can get a wife for my son from there.  "
"600","Genesis","24","8","If the woman is unwilling to come back with you, then you will be released from this oath of mine. Only do not take my son back there.”  "
"601","Genesis","24","9","So the servant put his hand under the thigh of his master Abraham and swore an oath to him concerning this matter. "
"602","Genesis","24","10","Then the servant left, taking with him ten of his master’s camels loaded with all kinds of good things from his master. He set out for Aram Naharaim  and made his way to the town of Nahor.  "
"603","Genesis","24","11","He had the camels kneel down near the well outside the town; it was toward evening, the time the women go out to draw water. "
"604","Genesis","24","12","Then he prayed, “ Lord , God of my master Abraham, make me successful today, and show kindness to my master Abraham.  "
"605","Genesis","24","13","See, I am standing beside this spring, and the daughters of the townspeople are coming out to draw water.  "
"606","Genesis","24","14","May it be that when I say to a young woman, ‘Please let down your jar that I may have a drink,’ and she says, ‘Drink, and I’ll water your camels too’—let her be the one you have chosen for your servant Isaac. By this I will know that you have shown kindness to my master.” "
"607","Genesis","24","15","Before he had finished praying, Rebekah came out with her jar on her shoulder. She was the daughter of Bethuel son of Milkah, who was the wife of Abraham’s brother Nahor.  "
"608","Genesis","24","16","The woman was very beautiful, a virgin; no man had ever slept with her. She went down to the spring, filled her jar and came up again. "
"609","Genesis","24","17","The servant hurried to meet her and said, “Please give me a little water from your jar.” "
"610","Genesis","24","18","“Drink, my lord,” she said, and quickly lowered the jar to her hands and gave him a drink. "
"611","Genesis","24","19","After she had given him a drink, she said, “I’ll draw water for your camels too, until they have had enough to drink.”  "
"612","Genesis","24","20","So she quickly emptied her jar into the trough, ran back to the well to draw more water, and drew enough for all his camels.  "
"613","Genesis","24","21","Without saying a word, the man watched her closely to learn whether or not the  Lord  had made his journey successful. "
"614","Genesis","24","22","When the camels had finished drinking, the man took out a gold nose ring weighing a beka  and two gold bracelets weighing ten shekels.   "
"615","Genesis","24","23","Then he asked, “Whose daughter are you? Please tell me, is there room in your father’s house for us to spend the night?” "
"616","Genesis","24","24","She answered him, “I am the daughter of Bethuel, the son that Milkah bore to Nahor.”  "
"617","Genesis","24","25","And she added, “We have plenty of straw and fodder, as well as room for you to spend the night.” "
"618","Genesis","24","26","Then the man bowed down and worshiped the  Lord ,  "
"619","Genesis","24","27","saying, “Praise be to the  Lord , the God of my master Abraham, who has not abandoned his kindness and faithfulness to my master. As for me, the  Lord  has led me on the journey to the house of my master’s relatives.” "
"620","Genesis","24","28","The young woman ran and told her mother’s household about these things.  "
"621","Genesis","24","29","Now Rebekah had a brother named Laban, and he hurried out to the man at the spring.  "
"622","Genesis","24","30","As soon as he had seen the nose ring, and the bracelets on his sister’s arms, and had heard Rebekah tell what the man said to her, he went out to the man and found him standing by the camels near the spring.  "
"623","Genesis","24","31","“Come, you who are blessed by the  Lord ,” he said. “Why are you standing out here? I have prepared the house and a place for the camels.” "
"624","Genesis","24","32","So the man went to the house, and the camels were unloaded. Straw and fodder were brought for the camels, and water for him and his men to wash their feet.  "
"625","Genesis","24","33","Then food was set before him, but he said, “I will not eat until I have told you what I have to say.” “Then tell us,” Laban said. "
"626","Genesis","24","34","So he said, “I am Abraham’s servant.  "
"627","Genesis","24","35","The  Lord  has blessed my master abundantly, and he has become wealthy. He has given him sheep and cattle, silver and gold, male and female servants, and camels and donkeys.  "
"628","Genesis","24","36","My master’s wife Sarah has borne him a son in her old age, and he has given him everything he owns.  "
"629","Genesis","24","37","And my master made me swear an oath, and said, ‘You must not get a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I live,  "
"630","Genesis","24","38","but go to my father’s family and to my own clan, and get a wife for my son.’ "
"631","Genesis","24","39","“Then I asked my master, ‘What if the woman will not come back with me?’ "
"632","Genesis","24","40","“He replied, ‘The  Lord , before whom I have walked faithfully, will send his angel with you and make your journey a success, so that you can get a wife for my son from my own clan and from my father’s family.  "
"633","Genesis","24","41","You will be released from my oath if, when you go to my clan, they refuse to give her to you—then you will be released from my oath.’ "
"634","Genesis","24","42","“When I came to the spring today, I said, ‘ Lord , God of my master Abraham, if you will, please grant success to the journey on which I have come.  "
"635","Genesis","24","43","See, I am standing beside this spring. If a young woman comes out to draw water and I say to her, “Please let me drink a little water from your jar,”  "
"636","Genesis","24","44","and if she says to me, “Drink, and I’ll draw water for your camels too,” let her be the one the  Lord  has chosen for my master’s son.’ "
"637","Genesis","24","45","“Before I finished praying in my heart, Rebekah came out, with her jar on her shoulder. She went down to the spring and drew water, and I said to her, ‘Please give me a drink.’ "
"638","Genesis","24","46","“She quickly lowered her jar from her shoulder and said, ‘Drink, and I’ll water your camels too.’ So I drank, and she watered the camels also. "
"639","Genesis","24","47","“I asked her, ‘Whose daughter are you?’ “She said, ‘The daughter of Bethuel son of Nahor, whom Milkah bore to him.’ “Then I put the ring in her nose and the bracelets on her arms,  "
"640","Genesis","24","48","and I bowed down and worshiped the  Lord . I praised the  Lord , the God of my master Abraham, who had led me on the right road to get the granddaughter of my master’s brother for his son.  "
"641","Genesis","24","49","Now if you will show kindness and faithfulness to my master, tell me; and if not, tell me, so I may know which way to turn.” "
"642","Genesis","24","50","Laban and Bethuel answered, “This is from the  Lord ; we can say nothing to you one way or the other.  "
"643","Genesis","24","51","Here is Rebekah; take her and go, and let her become the wife of your master’s son, as the  Lord  has directed.” "
"644","Genesis","24","52","When Abraham’s servant heard what they said, he bowed down to the ground before the  Lord .  "
"645","Genesis","24","53","Then the servant brought out gold and silver jewelry and articles of clothing and gave them to Rebekah; he also gave costly gifts to her brother and to her mother.  "
"646","Genesis","24","54","Then he and the men who were with him ate and drank and spent the night there. When they got up the next morning, he said, “Send me on my way to my master.” "
"647","Genesis","24","55","But her brother and her mother replied, “Let the young woman remain with us ten days or so; then you  may go.” "
"648","Genesis","24","56","But he said to them, “Do not detain me, now that the  Lord  has granted success to my journey. Send me on my way so I may go to my master.” "
"649","Genesis","24","57","Then they said, “Let’s call the young woman and ask her about it.”  "
"650","Genesis","24","58","So they called Rebekah and asked her, “Will you go with this man?” “I will go,” she said. "
"651","Genesis","24","59","So they sent their sister Rebekah on her way, along with her nurse and Abraham’s servant and his men.  "
"652","Genesis","24","60","And they blessed Rebekah and said to her, “Our sister, may you increase to thousands upon thousands; may your offspring possess the cities of their enemies.” "
"653","Genesis","24","61","Then Rebekah and her attendants got ready and mounted the camels and went back with the man. So the servant took Rebekah and left. "
"654","Genesis","24","62","Now Isaac had come from Beer Lahai Roi, for he was living in the Negev.  "
"655","Genesis","24","63","He went out to the field one evening to meditate,  and as he looked up, he saw camels approaching.  "
"656","Genesis","24","64","Rebekah also looked up and saw Isaac. She got down from her camel  "
"657","Genesis","24","65","and asked the servant, “Who is that man in the field coming to meet us?” “He is my master,” the servant answered. So she took her veil and covered herself. "
"658","Genesis","24","66","Then the servant told Isaac all he had done.  "
"659","Genesis","24","67","Isaac brought her into the tent of his mother Sarah, and he married Rebekah. So she became his wife, and he loved her; and Isaac was comforted after his mother’s death."
"660","Genesis","25","1","Abraham had taken another wife, whose name was Keturah.  "
"661","Genesis","25","2","She bore him Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak and Shuah.  "
"662","Genesis","25","3","Jokshan was the father of Sheba and Dedan; the descendants of Dedan were the Ashurites, the Letushites and the Leummites.  "
"663","Genesis","25","4","The sons of Midian were Ephah, Epher, Hanok, Abida and Eldaah. All these were descendants of Keturah. "
"664","Genesis","25","5","Abraham left everything he owned to Isaac.  "
"665","Genesis","25","6","But while he was still living, he gave gifts to the sons of his concubines and sent them away from his son Isaac to the land of the east. "
"666","Genesis","25","7","Abraham lived a hundred and seventy-five years.  "
"667","Genesis","25","8","Then Abraham breathed his last and died at a good old age, an old man and full of years; and he was gathered to his people.  "
"668","Genesis","25","9","His sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah near Mamre, in the field of Ephron son of Zohar the Hittite,  "
"669","Genesis","25","10","the field Abraham had bought from the Hittites.  There Abraham was buried with his wife Sarah.  "
"670","Genesis","25","11","After Abraham’s death, God blessed his son Isaac, who then lived near Beer Lahai Roi. "
"671","Genesis","25","12","This is the account of the family line of Abraham’s son Ishmael, whom Sarah’s slave, Hagar the Egyptian, bore to Abraham. "
"672","Genesis","25","13","These are the names of the sons of Ishmael, listed in the order of their birth: Nebaioth the firstborn of Ishmael, Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam,  "
"673","Genesis","25","14","Mishma, Dumah, Massa,  "
"674","Genesis","25","15","Hadad, Tema, Jetur, Naphish and Kedemah.  "
"675","Genesis","25","16","These were the sons of Ishmael, and these are the names of the twelve tribal rulers according to their settlements and camps.  "
"676","Genesis","25","17","Ishmael lived a hundred and thirty-seven years. He breathed his last and died, and he was gathered to his people.  "
"677","Genesis","25","18","His descendants settled in the area from Havilah to Shur, near the eastern border of Egypt, as you go toward Ashur. And they lived in hostility toward  all the tribes related to them. "
"678","Genesis","25","19","This is the account of the family line of Abraham’s son Isaac. Abraham became the father of Isaac,  "
"679","Genesis","25","20","and Isaac was forty years old when he married Rebekah daughter of Bethuel the Aramean from Paddan Aram  and sister of Laban the Aramean. "
"680","Genesis","25","21","Isaac prayed to the  Lord  on behalf of his wife, because she was childless. The  Lord  answered his prayer, and his wife Rebekah became pregnant.  "
"681","Genesis","25","22","The babies jostled each other within her, and she said, “Why is this happening to me?” So she went to inquire of the  Lord . "
"682","Genesis","25","23","The  Lord  said to her, “Two nations are in your womb, and two peoples from within you will be separated; one people will be stronger than the other, and the older will serve the younger.” "
"683","Genesis","25","24","When the time came for her to give birth, there were twin boys in her womb.  "
"684","Genesis","25","25","The first to come out was red, and his whole body was like a hairy garment; so they named him Esau.   "
"685","Genesis","25","26","After this, his brother came out, with his hand grasping Esau’s heel; so he was named Jacob.  Isaac was sixty years old when Rebekah gave birth to them. "
"686","Genesis","25","27","The boys grew up, and Esau became a skillful hunter, a man of the open country, while Jacob was content to stay at home among the tents.  "
"687","Genesis","25","28","Isaac, who had a taste for wild game, loved Esau, but Rebekah loved Jacob. "
"688","Genesis","25","29","Once when Jacob was cooking some stew, Esau came in from the open country, famished.  "
"689","Genesis","25","30","He said to Jacob, “Quick, let me have some of that red stew! I’m famished!” (That is why he was also called Edom. ) "
"690","Genesis","25","31","Jacob replied, “First sell me your birthright.” "
"691","Genesis","25","32","“Look, I am about to die,” Esau said. “What good is the birthright to me?” "
"692","Genesis","25","33","But Jacob said, “Swear to me first.” So he swore an oath to him, selling his birthright to Jacob. "
"693","Genesis","25","34","Then Jacob gave Esau some bread and some lentil stew. He ate and drank, and then got up and left. So Esau despised his birthright."
"694","Genesis","26","1","Now there was a famine in the land—besides the previous famine in Abraham’s time—and Isaac went to Abimelek king of the Philistines in Gerar.  "
"695","Genesis","26","2","The  Lord  appeared to Isaac and said, “Do not go down to Egypt; live in the land where I tell you to live.  "
"696","Genesis","26","3","Stay in this land for a while, and I will be with you and will bless you. For to you and your descendants I will give all these lands and will confirm the oath I swore to your father Abraham.  "
"697","Genesis","26","4","I will make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and will give them all these lands, and through your offspring  all nations on earth will be blessed,   "
"698","Genesis","26","5","because Abraham obeyed me and did everything I required of him, keeping my commands, my decrees and my instructions.”  "
"699","Genesis","26","6","So Isaac stayed in Gerar. "
"700","Genesis","26","7","When the men of that place asked him about his wife, he said, “She is my sister,” because he was afraid to say, “She is my wife.” He thought, “The men of this place might kill me on account of Rebekah, because she is beautiful.” "
"701","Genesis","26","8","When Isaac had been there a long time, Abimelek king of the Philistines looked down from a window and saw Isaac caressing his wife Rebekah.  "
"702","Genesis","26","9","So Abimelek summoned Isaac and said, “She is really your wife! Why did you say, ‘She is my sister’?” Isaac answered him, “Because I thought I might lose my life on account of her.” "
"703","Genesis","26","10","Then Abimelek said, “What is this you have done to us? One of the men might well have slept with your wife, and you would have brought guilt upon us.” "
"704","Genesis","26","11","So Abimelek gave orders to all the people: “Anyone who harms this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.” "
"705","Genesis","26","12","Isaac planted crops in that land and the same year reaped a hundredfold, because the  Lord  blessed him.  "
"706","Genesis","26","13","The man became rich, and his wealth continued to grow until he became very wealthy.  "
"707","Genesis","26","14","He had so many flocks and herds and servants that the Philistines envied him.  "
"708","Genesis","26","15","So all the wells that his father’s servants had dug in the time of his father Abraham, the Philistines stopped up, filling them with earth. "
"709","Genesis","26","16","Then Abimelek said to Isaac, “Move away from us; you have become too powerful for us.” "
"710","Genesis","26","17","So Isaac moved away from there and encamped in the Valley of Gerar, where he settled.  "
"711","Genesis","26","18","Isaac reopened the wells that had been dug in the time of his father Abraham, which the Philistines had stopped up after Abraham died, and he gave them the same names his father had given them. "
"712","Genesis","26","19","Isaac’s servants dug in the valley and discovered a well of fresh water there.  "
"713","Genesis","26","20","But the herders of Gerar quarreled with those of Isaac and said, “The water is ours!” So he named the well Esek,  because they disputed with him.  "
"714","Genesis","26","21","Then they dug another well, but they quarreled over that one also; so he named it Sitnah.   "
"715","Genesis","26","22","He moved on from there and dug another well, and no one quarreled over it. He named it Rehoboth,  saying, “Now the  Lord  has given us room and we will flourish in the land.” "
"716","Genesis","26","23","From there he went up to Beersheba.  "
"717","Genesis","26","24","That night the  Lord  appeared to him and said, “I am the God of your father Abraham. Do not be afraid, for I am with you; I will bless you and will increase the number of your descendants for the sake of my servant Abraham.” "
"718","Genesis","26","25","Isaac built an altar there and called on the name of the  Lord . There he pitched his tent, and there his servants dug a well. "
"719","Genesis","26","26","Meanwhile, Abimelek had come to him from Gerar, with Ahuzzath his personal adviser and Phicol the commander of his forces.  "
"720","Genesis","26","27","Isaac asked them, “Why have you come to me, since you were hostile to me and sent me away?” "
"721","Genesis","26","28","They answered, “We saw clearly that the  Lord  was with you; so we said, ‘There ought to be a sworn agreement between us’—between us and you. Let us make a treaty with you  "
"722","Genesis","26","29","that you will do us no harm, just as we did not harm you but always treated you well and sent you away peacefully. And now you are blessed by the  Lord .” "
"723","Genesis","26","30","Isaac then made a feast for them, and they ate and drank.  "
"724","Genesis","26","31","Early the next morning the men swore an oath to each other. Then Isaac sent them on their way, and they went away peacefully. "
"725","Genesis","26","32","That day Isaac’s servants came and told him about the well they had dug. They said, “We’ve found water!”  "
"726","Genesis","26","33","He called it Shibah,  and to this day the name of the town has been Beersheba. "
"727","Genesis","26","34","When Esau was forty years old, he married Judith daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and also Basemath daughter of Elon the Hittite.  "
"728","Genesis","26","35","They were a source of grief to Isaac and Rebekah."
"729","Genesis","27","1","When Isaac was old and his eyes were so weak that he could no longer see, he called for Esau his older son and said to him, “My son.” “Here I am,” he answered. "
"730","Genesis","27","2","Isaac said, “I am now an old man and don’t know the day of my death.  "
"731","Genesis","27","3","Now then, get your equipment—your quiver and bow—and go out to the open country to hunt some wild game for me.  "
"732","Genesis","27","4","Prepare me the kind of tasty food I like and bring it to me to eat, so that I may give you my blessing before I die.” "
"733","Genesis","27","5","Now Rebekah was listening as Isaac spoke to his son Esau. When Esau left for the open country to hunt game and bring it back,  "
"734","Genesis","27","6","Rebekah said to her son Jacob, “Look, I overheard your father say to your brother Esau,  "
"735","Genesis","27","7","‘Bring me some game and prepare me some tasty food to eat, so that I may give you my blessing in the presence of the  Lord  before I die.’  "
"736","Genesis","27","8","Now, my son, listen carefully and do what I tell you:  "
"737","Genesis","27","9","Go out to the flock and bring me two choice young goats, so I can prepare some tasty food for your father, just the way he likes it.  "
"738","Genesis","27","10","Then take it to your father to eat, so that he may give you his blessing before he dies.” "
"739","Genesis","27","11","Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, “But my brother Esau is a hairy man while I have smooth skin.  "
"740","Genesis","27","12","What if my father touches me? I would appear to be tricking him and would bring down a curse on myself rather than a blessing.” "
"741","Genesis","27","13","His mother said to him, “My son, let the curse fall on me. Just do what I say; go and get them for me.” "
"742","Genesis","27","14","So he went and got them and brought them to his mother, and she prepared some tasty food, just the way his father liked it.  "
"743","Genesis","27","15","Then Rebekah took the best clothes of Esau her older son, which she had in the house, and put them on her younger son Jacob.  "
"744","Genesis","27","16","She also covered his hands and the smooth part of his neck with the goatskins.  "
"745","Genesis","27","17","Then she handed to her son Jacob the tasty food and the bread she had made. "
"746","Genesis","27","18","He went to his father and said, “My father.” “Yes, my son,” he answered. “Who is it?” "
"747","Genesis","27","19","Jacob said to his father, “I am Esau your firstborn. I have done as you told me. Please sit up and eat some of my game, so that you may give me your blessing.” "
"748","Genesis","27","20","Isaac asked his son, “How did you find it so quickly, my son?” “The  Lord  your God gave me success,” he replied. "
"749","Genesis","27","21","Then Isaac said to Jacob, “Come near so I can touch you, my son, to know whether you really are my son Esau or not.” "
"750","Genesis","27","22","Jacob went close to his father Isaac, who touched him and said, “The voice is the voice of Jacob, but the hands are the hands of Esau.”  "
"751","Genesis","27","23","He did not recognize him, for his hands were hairy like those of his brother Esau; so he proceeded to bless him.  "
"752","Genesis","27","24","“Are you really my son Esau?” he asked. “I am,” he replied. "
"753","Genesis","27","25","Then he said, “My son, bring me some of your game to eat, so that I may give you my blessing.” Jacob brought it to him and he ate; and he brought some wine and he drank.  "
"754","Genesis","27","26","Then his father Isaac said to him, “Come here, my son, and kiss me.” "
"755","Genesis","27","27","So he went to him and kissed him. When Isaac caught the smell of his clothes, he blessed him and said, “Ah, the smell of my son is like the smell of a field that the  Lord  has blessed. "
"756","Genesis","27","28","May God give you heaven’s dew and earth’s richness— an abundance of grain and new wine. "
"757","Genesis","27","29","May nations serve you and peoples bow down to you. Be lord over your brothers, and may the sons of your mother bow down to you. May those who curse you be cursed and those who bless you be blessed.” "
"758","Genesis","27","30","After Isaac finished blessing him, and Jacob had scarcely left his father’s presence, his brother Esau came in from hunting.  "
"759","Genesis","27","31","He too prepared some tasty food and brought it to his father. Then he said to him, “My father, please sit up and eat some of my game, so that you may give me your blessing.” "
"760","Genesis","27","32","His father Isaac asked him, “Who are you?” “I am your son,” he answered, “your firstborn, Esau.” "
"761","Genesis","27","33","Isaac trembled violently and said, “Who was it, then, that hunted game and brought it to me? I ate it just before you came and I blessed him—and indeed he will be blessed!” "
"762","Genesis","27","34","When Esau heard his father’s words, he burst out with a loud and bitter cry and said to his father, “Bless me—me too, my father!” "
"763","Genesis","27","35","But he said, “Your brother came deceitfully and took your blessing.” "
"764","Genesis","27","36","Esau said, “Isn’t he rightly named Jacob ? This is the second time he has taken advantage of me: He took my birthright, and now he’s taken my blessing!” Then he asked, “Haven’t you reserved any blessing for me?” "
"765","Genesis","27","37","Isaac answered Esau, “I have made him lord over you and have made all his relatives his servants, and I have sustained him with grain and new wine. So what can I possibly do for you, my son?” "
"766","Genesis","27","38","Esau said to his father, “Do you have only one blessing, my father? Bless me too, my father!” Then Esau wept aloud. "
"767","Genesis","27","39","His father Isaac answered him, “Your dwelling will be away from the earth’s richness, away from the dew of heaven above. "
"768","Genesis","27","40","You will live by the sword and you will serve your brother. But when you grow restless, you will throw his yoke from off your neck.” "
"769","Genesis","27","41","Esau held a grudge against Jacob because of the blessing his father had given him. He said to himself, “The days of mourning for my father are near; then I will kill my brother Jacob.” "
"770","Genesis","27","42","When Rebekah was told what her older son Esau had said, she sent for her younger son Jacob and said to him, “Your brother Esau is planning to avenge himself by killing you.  "
"771","Genesis","27","43","Now then, my son, do what I say: Flee at once to my brother Laban in Harran.  "
"772","Genesis","27","44","Stay with him for a while until your brother’s fury subsides.  "
"773","Genesis","27","45","When your brother is no longer angry with you and forgets what you did to him, I’ll send word for you to come back from there. Why should I lose both of you in one day?” "
"774","Genesis","27","46","Then Rebekah said to Isaac, “I’m disgusted with living because of these Hittite women. If Jacob takes a wife from among the women of this land, from Hittite women like these, my life will not be worth living.”"
"775","Genesis","28","1","So Isaac called for Jacob and blessed him. Then he commanded him: “Do not marry a Canaanite woman.  "
"776","Genesis","28","2","Go at once to Paddan Aram,  to the house of your mother’s father Bethuel. Take a wife for yourself there, from among the daughters of Laban, your mother’s brother.  "
"777","Genesis","28","3","May God Almighty  bless you and make you fruitful and increase your numbers until you become a community of peoples.  "
"778","Genesis","28","4","May he give you and your descendants the blessing given to Abraham, so that you may take possession of the land where you now reside as a foreigner, the land God gave to Abraham.”  "
"779","Genesis","28","5","Then Isaac sent Jacob on his way, and he went to Paddan Aram, to Laban son of Bethuel the Aramean, the brother of Rebekah, who was the mother of Jacob and Esau. "
"780","Genesis","28","6","Now Esau learned that Isaac had blessed Jacob and had sent him to Paddan Aram to take a wife from there, and that when he blessed him he commanded him, “Do not marry a Canaanite woman,”  "
"781","Genesis","28","7","and that Jacob had obeyed his father and mother and had gone to Paddan Aram.  "
"782","Genesis","28","8","Esau then realized how displeasing the Canaanite women were to his father Isaac;  "
"783","Genesis","28","9","so he went to Ishmael and married Mahalath, the sister of Nebaioth and daughter of Ishmael son of Abraham, in addition to the wives he already had. "
"784","Genesis","28","10","Jacob left Beersheba and set out for Harran.  "
"785","Genesis","28","11","When he reached a certain place, he stopped for the night because the sun had set. Taking one of the stones there, he put it under his head and lay down to sleep.  "
"786","Genesis","28","12","He had a dream in which he saw a stairway resting on the earth, with its top reaching to heaven, and the angels of God were ascending and descending on it.  "
"787","Genesis","28","13","There above it  stood the  Lord , and he said: “I am the  Lord , the God of your father Abraham and the God of Isaac. I will give you and your descendants the land on which you are lying.  "
"788","Genesis","28","14","Your descendants will be like the dust of the earth, and you will spread out to the west and to the east, to the north and to the south. All peoples on earth will be blessed through you and your offspring.   "
"789","Genesis","28","15","I am with you and will watch over you wherever you go, and I will bring you back to this land. I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised you.” "
"790","Genesis","28","16","When Jacob awoke from his sleep, he thought, “Surely the  Lord  is in this place, and I was not aware of it.”  "
"791","Genesis","28","17","He was afraid and said, “How awesome is this place! This is none other than the house of God; this is the gate of heaven.” "
"792","Genesis","28","18","Early the next morning Jacob took the stone he had placed under his head and set it up as a pillar and poured oil on top of it.  "
"793","Genesis","28","19","He called that place Bethel,  though the city used to be called Luz. "
"794","Genesis","28","20","Then Jacob made a vow, saying, “If God will be with me and will watch over me on this journey I am taking and will give me food to eat and clothes to wear  "
"795","Genesis","28","21","so that I return safely to my father’s household, then the  Lord  will be my God  "
"796","Genesis","28","22","and  this stone that I have set up as a pillar will be God’s house, and of all that you give me I will give you a tenth.”"
"797","Genesis","29","1","Then Jacob continued on his journey and came to the land of the eastern peoples.  "
"798","Genesis","29","2","There he saw a well in the open country, with three flocks of sheep lying near it because the flocks were watered from that well. The stone over the mouth of the well was large.  "
"799","Genesis","29","3","When all the flocks were gathered there, the shepherds would roll the stone away from the well’s mouth and water the sheep. Then they would return the stone to its place over the mouth of the well. "
"800","Genesis","29","4","Jacob asked the shepherds, “My brothers, where are you from?” “We’re from Harran,” they replied. "
"801","Genesis","29","5","He said to them, “Do you know Laban, Nahor’s grandson?” “Yes, we know him,” they answered. "
"802","Genesis","29","6","Then Jacob asked them, “Is he well?” “Yes, he is,” they said, “and here comes his daughter Rachel with the sheep.” "
"803","Genesis","29","7","“Look,” he said, “the sun is still high; it is not time for the flocks to be gathered. Water the sheep and take them back to pasture.” "
"804","Genesis","29","8","“We can’t,” they replied, “until all the flocks are gathered and the stone has been rolled away from the mouth of the well. Then we will water the sheep.” "
"805","Genesis","29","9","While he was still talking with them, Rachel came with her father’s sheep, for she was a shepherd.  "
"806","Genesis","29","10","When Jacob saw Rachel daughter of his uncle Laban, and Laban’s sheep, he went over and rolled the stone away from the mouth of the well and watered his uncle’s sheep.  "
"807","Genesis","29","11","Then Jacob kissed Rachel and began to weep aloud.  "
"808","Genesis","29","12","He had told Rachel that he was a relative of her father and a son of Rebekah. So she ran and told her father. "
"809","Genesis","29","13","As soon as Laban heard the news about Jacob, his sister’s son, he hurried to meet him. He embraced him and kissed him and brought him to his home, and there Jacob told him all these things.  "
"810","Genesis","29","14","Then Laban said to him, “You are my own flesh and blood.” After Jacob had stayed with him for a whole month,  "
"811","Genesis","29","15","Laban said to him, “Just because you are a relative of mine, should you work for me for nothing? Tell me what your wages should be.” "
"812","Genesis","29","16","Now Laban had two daughters; the name of the older was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel.  "
"813","Genesis","29","17","Leah had weak  eyes, but Rachel had a lovely figure and was beautiful.  "
"814","Genesis","29","18","Jacob was in love with Rachel and said, “I’ll work for you seven years in return for your younger daughter Rachel.” "
"815","Genesis","29","19","Laban said, “It’s better that I give her to you than to some other man. Stay here with me.”  "
"816","Genesis","29","20","So Jacob served seven years to get Rachel, but they seemed like only a few days to him because of his love for her. "
"817","Genesis","29","21","Then Jacob said to Laban, “Give me my wife. My time is completed, and I want to make love to her.” "
"818","Genesis","29","22","So Laban brought together all the people of the place and gave a feast.  "
"819","Genesis","29","23","But when evening came, he took his daughter Leah and brought her to Jacob, and Jacob made love to her.  "
"820","Genesis","29","24","And Laban gave his servant Zilpah to his daughter as her attendant. "
"821","Genesis","29","25","When morning came, there was Leah! So Jacob said to Laban, “What is this you have done to me? I served you for Rachel, didn’t I? Why have you deceived me?” "
"822","Genesis","29","26","Laban replied, “It is not our custom here to give the younger daughter in marriage before the older one.  "
"823","Genesis","29","27","Finish this daughter’s bridal week; then we will give you the younger one also, in return for another seven years of work.” "
"824","Genesis","29","28","And Jacob did so. He finished the week with Leah, and then Laban gave him his daughter Rachel to be his wife.  "
"825","Genesis","29","29","Laban gave his servant Bilhah to his daughter Rachel as her attendant.  "
"826","Genesis","29","30","Jacob made love to Rachel also, and his love for Rachel was greater than his love for Leah. And he worked for Laban another seven years. "
"827","Genesis","29","31","When the  Lord  saw that Leah was not loved, he enabled her to conceive, but Rachel remained childless.  "
"828","Genesis","29","32","Leah became pregnant and gave birth to a son. She named him Reuben,  for she said, “It is because the  Lord  has seen my misery. Surely my husband will love me now.” "
"829","Genesis","29","33","She conceived again, and when she gave birth to a son she said, “Because the  Lord  heard that I am not loved, he gave me this one too.” So she named him Simeon. "
"830","Genesis","29","34","Again she conceived, and when she gave birth to a son she said, “Now at last my husband will become attached to me, because I have borne him three sons.” So he was named Levi. "
"831","Genesis","29","35","She conceived again, and when she gave birth to a son she said, “This time I will praise the  Lord .” So she named him Judah.  Then she stopped having children."
"832","Genesis","30","1","When Rachel saw that she was not bearing Jacob any children, she became jealous of her sister. So she said to Jacob, “Give me children, or I’ll die!” "
"833","Genesis","30","2","Jacob became angry with her and said, “Am I in the place of God, who has kept you from having children?” "
"834","Genesis","30","3","Then she said, “Here is Bilhah, my servant. Sleep with her so that she can bear children for me and I too can build a family through her.” "
"835","Genesis","30","4","So she gave him her servant Bilhah as a wife. Jacob slept with her,  "
"836","Genesis","30","5","and she became pregnant and bore him a son.  "
"837","Genesis","30","6","Then Rachel said, “God has vindicated me; he has listened to my plea and given me a son.” Because of this she named him Dan. "
"838","Genesis","30","7","Rachel’s servant Bilhah conceived again and bore Jacob a second son.  "
"839","Genesis","30","8","Then Rachel said, “I have had a great struggle with my sister, and I have won.” So she named him Naphtali. "
"840","Genesis","30","9","When Leah saw that she had stopped having children, she took her servant Zilpah and gave her to Jacob as a wife.  "
"841","Genesis","30","10","Leah’s servant Zilpah bore Jacob a son.  "
"842","Genesis","30","11","Then Leah said, “What good fortune!”  So she named him Gad. "
"843","Genesis","30","12","Leah’s servant Zilpah bore Jacob a second son.  "
"844","Genesis","30","13","Then Leah said, “How happy I am! The women will call me happy.” So she named him Asher. "
"845","Genesis","30","14","During wheat harvest, Reuben went out into the fields and found some mandrake plants, which he brought to his mother Leah. Rachel said to Leah, “Please give me some of your son’s mandrakes.” "
"846","Genesis","30","15","But she said to her, “Wasn’t it enough that you took away my husband? Will you take my son’s mandrakes too?” “Very well,” Rachel said, “he can sleep with you tonight in return for your son’s mandrakes.” "
"847","Genesis","30","16","So when Jacob came in from the fields that evening, Leah went out to meet him. “You must sleep with me,” she said. “I have hired you with my son’s mandrakes.” So he slept with her that night. "
"848","Genesis","30","17","God listened to Leah, and she became pregnant and bore Jacob a fifth son.  "
"849","Genesis","30","18","Then Leah said, “God has rewarded me for giving my servant to my husband.” So she named him Issachar. "
"850","Genesis","30","19","Leah conceived again and bore Jacob a sixth son.  "
"851","Genesis","30","20","Then Leah said, “God has presented me with a precious gift. This time my husband will treat me with honor, because I have borne him six sons.” So she named him Zebulun. "
"852","Genesis","30","21","Some time later she gave birth to a daughter and named her Dinah. "
"853","Genesis","30","22","Then God remembered Rachel; he listened to her and enabled her to conceive.  "
"854","Genesis","30","23","She became pregnant and gave birth to a son and said, “God has taken away my disgrace.”  "
"855","Genesis","30","24","She named him Joseph,  and said, “May the  Lord  add to me another son.” "
"856","Genesis","30","25","After Rachel gave birth to Joseph, Jacob said to Laban, “Send me on my way so I can go back to my own homeland.  "
"857","Genesis","30","26","Give me my wives and children, for whom I have served you, and I will be on my way. You know how much work I’ve done for you.” "
"858","Genesis","30","27","But Laban said to him, “If I have found favor in your eyes, please stay. I have learned by divination that the  Lord  has blessed me because of you.”  "
"859","Genesis","30","28","He added, “Name your wages, and I will pay them.” "
"860","Genesis","30","29","Jacob said to him, “You know how I have worked for you and how your livestock has fared under my care.  "
"861","Genesis","30","30","The little you had before I came has increased greatly, and the  Lord  has blessed you wherever I have been. But now, when may I do something for my own household?” "
"862","Genesis","30","31","“What shall I give you?” he asked. “Don’t give me anything,” Jacob replied. “But if you will do this one thing for me, I will go on tending your flocks and watching over them:  "
"863","Genesis","30","32","Let me go through all your flocks today and remove from them every speckled or spotted sheep, every dark-colored lamb and every spotted or speckled goat. They will be my wages.  "
"864","Genesis","30","33","And my honesty will testify for me in the future, whenever you check on the wages you have paid me. Any goat in my possession that is not speckled or spotted, or any lamb that is not dark-colored, will be considered stolen.” "
"865","Genesis","30","34","“Agreed,” said Laban. “Let it be as you have said.”  "
"866","Genesis","30","35","That same day he removed all the male goats that were streaked or spotted, and all the speckled or spotted female goats (all that had white on them) and all the dark-colored lambs, and he placed them in the care of his sons.  "
"867","Genesis","30","36","Then he put a three-day journey between himself and Jacob, while Jacob continued to tend the rest of Laban’s flocks. "
"868","Genesis","30","37","Jacob, however, took fresh-cut branches from poplar, almond and plane trees and made white stripes on them by peeling the bark and exposing the white inner wood of the branches.  "
"869","Genesis","30","38","Then he placed the peeled branches in all the watering troughs, so that they would be directly in front of the flocks when they came to drink. When the flocks were in heat and came to drink,  "
"870","Genesis","30","39","they mated in front of the branches. And they bore young that were streaked or speckled or spotted.  "
"871","Genesis","30","40","Jacob set apart the young of the flock by themselves, but made the rest face the streaked and dark-colored animals that belonged to Laban. Thus he made separate flocks for himself and did not put them with Laban’s animals.  "
"872","Genesis","30","41","Whenever the stronger females were in heat, Jacob would place the branches in the troughs in front of the animals so they would mate near the branches,  "
"873","Genesis","30","42","but if the animals were weak, he would not place them there. So the weak animals went to Laban and the strong ones to Jacob.  "
"874","Genesis","30","43","In this way the man grew exceedingly prosperous and came to own large flocks, and female and male servants, and camels and donkeys."
"875","Genesis","31","1","Jacob heard that Laban’s sons were saying, “Jacob has taken everything our father owned and has gained all this wealth from what belonged to our father.”  "
"876","Genesis","31","2","And Jacob noticed that Laban’s attitude toward him was not what it had been. "
"877","Genesis","31","3","Then the  Lord  said to Jacob, “Go back to the land of your fathers and to your relatives, and I will be with you.” "
"878","Genesis","31","4","So Jacob sent word to Rachel and Leah to come out to the fields where his flocks were.  "
"879","Genesis","31","5","He said to them, “I see that your father’s attitude toward me is not what it was before, but the God of my father has been with me.  "
"880","Genesis","31","6","You know that I’ve worked for your father with all my strength,  "
"881","Genesis","31","7","yet your father has cheated me by changing my wages ten times. However, God has not allowed him to harm me.  "
"882","Genesis","31","8","If he said, ‘The speckled ones will be your wages,’ then all the flocks gave birth to speckled young; and if he said, ‘The streaked ones will be your wages,’ then all the flocks bore streaked young.  "
"883","Genesis","31","9","So God has taken away your father’s livestock and has given them to me. "
"884","Genesis","31","10","“In breeding season I once had a dream in which I looked up and saw that the male goats mating with the flock were streaked, speckled or spotted.  "
"885","Genesis","31","11","The angel of God said to me in the dream, ‘Jacob.’ I answered, ‘Here I am.’  "
"886","Genesis","31","12","And he said, ‘Look up and see that all the male goats mating with the flock are streaked, speckled or spotted, for I have seen all that Laban has been doing to you.  "
"887","Genesis","31","13","I am the God of Bethel, where you anointed a pillar and where you made a vow to me. Now leave this land at once and go back to your native land.’ ” "
"888","Genesis","31","14","Then Rachel and Leah replied, “Do we still have any share in the inheritance of our father’s estate?  "
"889","Genesis","31","15","Does he not regard us as foreigners? Not only has he sold us, but he has used up what was paid for us.  "
"890","Genesis","31","16","Surely all the wealth that God took away from our father belongs to us and our children. So do whatever God has told you.” "
"891","Genesis","31","17","Then Jacob put his children and his wives on camels,  "
"892","Genesis","31","18","and he drove all his livestock ahead of him, along with all the goods he had accumulated in Paddan Aram,  to go to his father Isaac in the land of Canaan. "
"893","Genesis","31","19","When Laban had gone to shear his sheep, Rachel stole her father’s household gods.  "
"894","Genesis","31","20","Moreover, Jacob deceived Laban the Aramean by not telling him he was running away.  "
"895","Genesis","31","21","So he fled with all he had, crossed the Euphrates River, and headed for the hill country of Gilead. "
"896","Genesis","31","22","On the third day Laban was told that Jacob had fled.  "
"897","Genesis","31","23","Taking his relatives with him, he pursued Jacob for seven days and caught up with him in the hill country of Gilead.  "
"898","Genesis","31","24","Then God came to Laban the Aramean in a dream at night and said to him, “Be careful not to say anything to Jacob, either good or bad.” "
"899","Genesis","31","25","Jacob had pitched his tent in the hill country of Gilead when Laban overtook him, and Laban and his relatives camped there too.  "
"900","Genesis","31","26","Then Laban said to Jacob, “What have you done? You’ve deceived me, and you’ve carried off my daughters like captives in war.  "
"901","Genesis","31","27","Why did you run off secretly and deceive me? Why didn’t you tell me, so I could send you away with joy and singing to the music of timbrels and harps?  "
"902","Genesis","31","28","You didn’t even let me kiss my grandchildren and my daughters goodbye. You have done a foolish thing.  "
"903","Genesis","31","29","I have the power to harm you; but last night the God of your father said to me, ‘Be careful not to say anything to Jacob, either good or bad.’  "
"904","Genesis","31","30","Now you have gone off because you longed to return to your father’s household. But why did you steal my gods?” "
"905","Genesis","31","31","Jacob answered Laban, “I was afraid, because I thought you would take your daughters away from me by force.  "
"906","Genesis","31","32","But if you find anyone who has your gods, that person shall not live. In the presence of our relatives, see for yourself whether there is anything of yours here with me; and if so, take it.” Now Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen the gods. "
"907","Genesis","31","33","So Laban went into Jacob’s tent and into Leah’s tent and into the tent of the two female servants, but he found nothing. After he came out of Leah’s tent, he entered Rachel’s tent.  "
"908","Genesis","31","34","Now Rachel had taken the household gods and put them inside her camel’s saddle and was sitting on them. Laban searched through everything in the tent but found nothing. "
"909","Genesis","31","35","Rachel said to her father, “Don’t be angry, my lord, that I cannot stand up in your presence; I’m having my period.” So he searched but could not find the household gods. "
"910","Genesis","31","36","Jacob was angry and took Laban to task. “What is my crime?” he asked Laban. “How have I wronged you that you hunt me down?  "
"911","Genesis","31","37","Now that you have searched through all my goods, what have you found that belongs to your household? Put it here in front of your relatives and mine, and let them judge between the two of us. "
"912","Genesis","31","38","“I have been with you for twenty years now. Your sheep and goats have not miscarried, nor have I eaten rams from your flocks.  "
"913","Genesis","31","39","I did not bring you animals torn by wild beasts; I bore the loss myself. And you demanded payment from me for whatever was stolen by day or night.  "
"914","Genesis","31","40","This was my situation: The heat consumed me in the daytime and the cold at night, and sleep fled from my eyes.  "
"915","Genesis","31","41","It was like this for the twenty years I was in your household. I worked for you fourteen years for your two daughters and six years for your flocks, and you changed my wages ten times.  "
"916","Genesis","31","42","If the God of my father, the God of Abraham and the Fear of Isaac, had not been with me, you would surely have sent me away empty-handed. But God has seen my hardship and the toil of my hands, and last night he rebuked you.” "
"917","Genesis","31","43","Laban answered Jacob, “The women are my daughters, the children are my children, and the flocks are my flocks. All you see is mine. Yet what can I do today about these daughters of mine, or about the children they have borne?  "
"918","Genesis","31","44","Come now, let’s make a covenant, you and I, and let it serve as a witness between us.” "
"919","Genesis","31","45","So Jacob took a stone and set it up as a pillar.  "
"920","Genesis","31","46","He said to his relatives, “Gather some stones.” So they took stones and piled them in a heap, and they ate there by the heap.  "
"921","Genesis","31","47","Laban called it Jegar Sahadutha, and Jacob called it Galeed. "
"922","Genesis","31","48","Laban said, “This heap is a witness between you and me today.” That is why it was called Galeed.  "
"923","Genesis","31","49","It was also called Mizpah,  because he said, “May the  Lord  keep watch between you and me when we are away from each other.  "
"924","Genesis","31","50","If you mistreat my daughters or if you take any wives besides my daughters, even though no one is with us, remember that God is a witness between you and me.” "
"925","Genesis","31","51","Laban also said to Jacob, “Here is this heap, and here is this pillar I have set up between you and me.  "
"926","Genesis","31","52","This heap is a witness, and this pillar is a witness, that I will not go past this heap to your side to harm you and that you will not go past this heap and pillar to my side to harm me.  "
"927","Genesis","31","53","May the God of Abraham and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge between us.” So Jacob took an oath in the name of the Fear of his father Isaac.  "
"928","Genesis","31","54","He offered a sacrifice there in the hill country and invited his relatives to a meal. After they had eaten, they spent the night there. "
"929","Genesis","31","55","Early the next morning Laban kissed his grandchildren and his daughters and blessed them. Then he left and returned home."
"930","Genesis","32","1","Jacob also went on his way, and the angels of God met him.  "
"931","Genesis","32","2","When Jacob saw them, he said, “This is the camp of God!” So he named that place Mahanaim. "
"932","Genesis","32","3","Jacob sent messengers ahead of him to his brother Esau in the land of Seir, the country of Edom.  "
"933","Genesis","32","4","He instructed them: “This is what you are to say to my lord Esau: ‘Your servant Jacob says, I have been staying with Laban and have remained there till now.  "
"934","Genesis","32","5","I have cattle and donkeys, sheep and goats, male and female servants. Now I am sending this message to my lord, that I may find favor in your eyes.’ ” "
"935","Genesis","32","6","When the messengers returned to Jacob, they said, “We went to your brother Esau, and now he is coming to meet you, and four hundred men are with him.” "
"936","Genesis","32","7","In great fear and distress Jacob divided the people who were with him into two groups,  and the flocks and herds and camels as well.  "
"937","Genesis","32","8","He thought, “If Esau comes and attacks one group,  the group  that is left may escape.” "
"938","Genesis","32","9","Then Jacob prayed, “O God of my father Abraham, God of my father Isaac,  Lord , you who said to me, ‘Go back to your country and your relatives, and I will make you prosper,’  "
"939","Genesis","32","10","I am unworthy of all the kindness and faithfulness you have shown your servant. I had only my staff when I crossed this Jordan, but now I have become two camps.  "
"940","Genesis","32","11","Save me, I pray, from the hand of my brother Esau, for I am afraid he will come and attack me, and also the mothers with their children.  "
"941","Genesis","32","12","But you have said, ‘I will surely make you prosper and will make your descendants like the sand of the sea, which cannot be counted.’ ” "
"942","Genesis","32","13","He spent the night there, and from what he had with him he selected a gift for his brother Esau:  "
"943","Genesis","32","14","two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,  "
"944","Genesis","32","15","thirty female camels with their young, forty cows and ten bulls, and twenty female donkeys and ten male donkeys.  "
"945","Genesis","32","16","He put them in the care of his servants, each herd by itself, and said to his servants, “Go ahead of me, and keep some space between the herds.” "
"946","Genesis","32","17","He instructed the one in the lead: “When my brother Esau meets you and asks, ‘Who do you belong to, and where are you going, and who owns all these animals in front of you?’  "
"947","Genesis","32","18","then you are to say, ‘They belong to your servant Jacob. They are a gift sent to my lord Esau, and he is coming behind us.’ ” "
"948","Genesis","32","19","He also instructed the second, the third and all the others who followed the herds: “You are to say the same thing to Esau when you meet him.  "
"949","Genesis","32","20","And be sure to say, ‘Your servant Jacob is coming behind us.’ ” For he thought, “I will pacify him with these gifts I am sending on ahead; later, when I see him, perhaps he will receive me.”  "
"950","Genesis","32","21","So Jacob’s gifts went on ahead of him, but he himself spent the night in the camp. "
"951","Genesis","32","22","That night Jacob got up and took his two wives, his two female servants and his eleven sons and crossed the ford of the Jabbok.  "
"952","Genesis","32","23","After he had sent them across the stream, he sent over all his possessions.  "
"953","Genesis","32","24","So Jacob was left alone, and a man wrestled with him till daybreak.  "
"954","Genesis","32","25","When the man saw that he could not overpower him, he touched the socket of Jacob’s hip so that his hip was wrenched as he wrestled with the man.  "
"955","Genesis","32","26","Then the man said, “Let me go, for it is daybreak.” But Jacob replied, “I will not let you go unless you bless me.” "
"956","Genesis","32","27","The man asked him, “What is your name?” “Jacob,” he answered. "
"957","Genesis","32","28","Then the man said, “Your name will no longer be Jacob, but Israel,  because you have struggled with God and with humans and have overcome.” "
"958","Genesis","32","29","Jacob said, “Please tell me your name.” But he replied, “Why do you ask my name?” Then he blessed him there. "
"959","Genesis","32","30","So Jacob called the place Peniel,  saying, “It is because I saw God face to face, and yet my life was spared.” "
"960","Genesis","32","31","The sun rose above him as he passed Peniel,  and he was limping because of his hip.  "
"961","Genesis","32","32","Therefore to this day the Israelites do not eat the tendon attached to the socket of the hip, because the socket of Jacob’s hip was touched near the tendon."
"962","Genesis","33","1","Jacob looked up and there was Esau, coming with his four hundred men; so he divided the children among Leah, Rachel and the two female servants.  "
"963","Genesis","33","2","He put the female servants and their children in front, Leah and her children next, and Rachel and Joseph in the rear.  "
"964","Genesis","33","3","He himself went on ahead and bowed down to the ground seven times as he approached his brother. "
"965","Genesis","33","4","But Esau ran to meet Jacob and embraced him; he threw his arms around his neck and kissed him. And they wept.  "
"966","Genesis","33","5","Then Esau looked up and saw the women and children. “Who are these with you?” he asked. Jacob answered, “They are the children God has graciously given your servant.” "
"967","Genesis","33","6","Then the female servants and their children approached and bowed down.  "
"968","Genesis","33","7","Next, Leah and her children came and bowed down. Last of all came Joseph and Rachel, and they too bowed down. "
"969","Genesis","33","8","Esau asked, “What’s the meaning of all these flocks and herds I met?” “To find favor in your eyes, my lord,” he said. "
"970","Genesis","33","9","But Esau said, “I already have plenty, my brother. Keep what you have for yourself.” "
"971","Genesis","33","10","“No, please!” said Jacob. “If I have found favor in your eyes, accept this gift from me. For to see your face is like seeing the face of God, now that you have received me favorably.  "
"972","Genesis","33","11","Please accept the present that was brought to you, for God has been gracious to me and I have all I need.” And because Jacob insisted, Esau accepted it. "
"973","Genesis","33","12","Then Esau said, “Let us be on our way; I’ll accompany you.” "
"974","Genesis","33","13","But Jacob said to him, “My lord knows that the children are tender and that I must care for the ewes and cows that are nursing their young. If they are driven hard just one day, all the animals will die.  "
"975","Genesis","33","14","So let my lord go on ahead of his servant, while I move along slowly at the pace of the flocks and herds before me and the pace of the children, until I come to my lord in Seir.” "
"976","Genesis","33","15","Esau said, “Then let me leave some of my men with you.” “But why do that?” Jacob asked. “Just let me find favor in the eyes of my lord.” "
"977","Genesis","33","16","So that day Esau started on his way back to Seir.  "
"978","Genesis","33","17","Jacob, however, went to Sukkoth, where he built a place for himself and made shelters for his livestock. That is why the place is called Sukkoth. "
"979","Genesis","33","18","After Jacob came from Paddan Aram,  he arrived safely at the city of Shechem in Canaan and camped within sight of the city.  "
"980","Genesis","33","19","For a hundred pieces of silver,  he bought from the sons of Hamor, the father of Shechem, the plot of ground where he pitched his tent.  "
"981","Genesis","33","20","There he set up an altar and called it El Elohe Israel."
"982","Genesis","34","1","Now Dinah, the daughter Leah had borne to Jacob, went out to visit the women of the land.  "
"983","Genesis","34","2","When Shechem son of Hamor the Hivite, the ruler of that area, saw her, he took her and raped her.  "
"984","Genesis","34","3","His heart was drawn to Dinah daughter of Jacob; he loved the young woman and spoke tenderly to her.  "
"985","Genesis","34","4","And Shechem said to his father Hamor, “Get me this girl as my wife.” "
"986","Genesis","34","5","When Jacob heard that his daughter Dinah had been defiled, his sons were in the fields with his livestock; so he did nothing about it until they came home. "
"987","Genesis","34","6","Then Shechem’s father Hamor went out to talk with Jacob.  "
"988","Genesis","34","7","Meanwhile, Jacob’s sons had come in from the fields as soon as they heard what had happened. They were shocked and furious, because Shechem had done an outrageous thing in  Israel by sleeping with Jacob’s daughter—a thing that should not be done. "
"989","Genesis","34","8","But Hamor said to them, “My son Shechem has his heart set on your daughter. Please give her to him as his wife.  "
"990","Genesis","34","9","Intermarry with us; give us your daughters and take our daughters for yourselves.  "
"991","Genesis","34","10","You can settle among us; the land is open to you. Live in it, trade  in it, and acquire property in it.” "
"992","Genesis","34","11","Then Shechem said to Dinah’s father and brothers, “Let me find favor in your eyes, and I will give you whatever you ask.  "
"993","Genesis","34","12","Make the price for the bride and the gift I am to bring as great as you like, and I’ll pay whatever you ask me. Only give me the young woman as my wife.” "
"994","Genesis","34","13","Because their sister Dinah had been defiled, Jacob’s sons replied deceitfully as they spoke to Shechem and his father Hamor.  "
"995","Genesis","34","14","They said to them, “We can’t do such a thing; we can’t give our sister to a man who is not circumcised. That would be a disgrace to us.  "
"996","Genesis","34","15","We will enter into an agreement with you on one condition only: that you become like us by circumcising all your males.  "
"997","Genesis","34","16","Then we will give you our daughters and take your daughters for ourselves. We’ll settle among you and become one people with you.  "
"998","Genesis","34","17","But if you will not agree to be circumcised, we’ll take our sister and go.” "
"999","Genesis","34","18","Their proposal seemed good to Hamor and his son Shechem.  "
"1000","Genesis","34","19","The young man, who was the most honored of all his father’s family, lost no time in doing what they said, because he was delighted with Jacob’s daughter.  "
"1001","Genesis","34","20","So Hamor and his son Shechem went to the gate of their city to speak to the men of their city.  "
"1002","Genesis","34","21","“These men are friendly toward us,” they said. “Let them live in our land and trade in it; the land has plenty of room for them. We can marry their daughters and they can marry ours.  "
"1003","Genesis","34","22","But the men will agree to live with us as one people only on the condition that our males be circumcised, as they themselves are.  "
"1004","Genesis","34","23","Won’t their livestock, their property and all their other animals become ours? So let us agree to their terms, and they will settle among us.” "
"1005","Genesis","34","24","All the men who went out of the city gate agreed with Hamor and his son Shechem, and every male in the city was circumcised. "
"1006","Genesis","34","25","Three days later, while all of them were still in pain, two of Jacob’s sons, Simeon and Levi, Dinah’s brothers, took their swords and attacked the unsuspecting city, killing every male.  "
"1007","Genesis","34","26","They put Hamor and his son Shechem to the sword and took Dinah from Shechem’s house and left.  "
"1008","Genesis","34","27","The sons of Jacob came upon the dead bodies and looted the city where  their sister had been defiled.  "
"1009","Genesis","34","28","They seized their flocks and herds and donkeys and everything else of theirs in the city and out in the fields.  "
"1010","Genesis","34","29","They carried off all their wealth and all their women and children, taking as plunder everything in the houses. "
"1011","Genesis","34","30","Then Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, “You have brought trouble on me by making me obnoxious to the Canaanites and Perizzites, the people living in this land. We are few in number, and if they join forces against me and attack me, I and my household will be destroyed.” "
"1012","Genesis","34","31","But they replied, “Should he have treated our sister like a prostitute?”"
"1013","Genesis","35","1","Then God said to Jacob, “Go up to Bethel and settle there, and build an altar there to God, who appeared to you when you were fleeing from your brother Esau.” "
"1014","Genesis","35","2","So Jacob said to his household and to all who were with him, “Get rid of the foreign gods you have with you, and purify yourselves and change your clothes.  "
"1015","Genesis","35","3","Then come, let us go up to Bethel, where I will build an altar to God, who answered me in the day of my distress and who has been with me wherever I have gone.”  "
"1016","Genesis","35","4","So they gave Jacob all the foreign gods they had and the rings in their ears, and Jacob buried them under the oak at Shechem.  "
"1017","Genesis","35","5","Then they set out, and the terror of God fell on the towns all around them so that no one pursued them. "
"1018","Genesis","35","6","Jacob and all the people with him came to Luz (that is, Bethel) in the land of Canaan.  "
"1019","Genesis","35","7","There he built an altar, and he called the place El Bethel,  because it was there that God revealed himself to him when he was fleeing from his brother. "
"1020","Genesis","35","8","Now Deborah, Rebekah’s nurse, died and was buried under the oak outside Bethel. So it was named Allon Bakuth. "
"1021","Genesis","35","9","After Jacob returned from Paddan Aram,  God appeared to him again and blessed him.  "
"1022","Genesis","35","10","God said to him, “Your name is Jacob,  but you will no longer be called Jacob; your name will be Israel. ” So he named him Israel. "
"1023","Genesis","35","11","And God said to him, “I am God Almighty ; be fruitful and increase in number. A nation and a community of nations will come from you, and kings will be among your descendants.  "
"1024","Genesis","35","12","The land I gave to Abraham and Isaac I also give to you, and I will give this land to your descendants after you.”  "
"1025","Genesis","35","13","Then God went up from him at the place where he had talked with him. "
"1026","Genesis","35","14","Jacob set up a stone pillar at the place where God had talked with him, and he poured out a drink offering on it; he also poured oil on it.  "
"1027","Genesis","35","15","Jacob called the place where God had talked with him Bethel. "
"1028","Genesis","35","16","Then they moved on from Bethel. While they were still some distance from Ephrath, Rachel began to give birth and had great difficulty.  "
"1029","Genesis","35","17","And as she was having great difficulty in childbirth, the midwife said to her, “Don’t despair, for you have another son.”  "
"1030","Genesis","35","18","As she breathed her last—for she was dying—she named her son Ben-Oni.  But his father named him Benjamin. "
"1031","Genesis","35","19","So Rachel died and was buried on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem).  "
"1032","Genesis","35","20","Over her tomb Jacob set up a pillar, and to this day that pillar marks Rachel’s tomb. "
"1033","Genesis","35","21","Israel moved on again and pitched his tent beyond Migdal Eder.  "
"1034","Genesis","35","22","While Israel was living in that region, Reuben went in and slept with his father’s concubine Bilhah, and Israel heard of it. Jacob had twelve sons: "
"1035","Genesis","35","23","The sons of Leah: Reuben the firstborn of Jacob, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar and Zebulun. "
"1036","Genesis","35","24","The sons of Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin. "
"1037","Genesis","35","25","The sons of Rachel’s servant Bilhah: Dan and Naphtali. "
"1038","Genesis","35","26","The sons of Leah’s servant Zilpah: Gad and Asher. These were the sons of Jacob, who were born to him in Paddan Aram. "
"1039","Genesis","35","27","Jacob came home to his father Isaac in Mamre, near Kiriath Arba (that is, Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac had stayed.  "
"1040","Genesis","35","28","Isaac lived a hundred and eighty years.  "
"1041","Genesis","35","29","Then he breathed his last and died and was gathered to his people, old and full of years. And his sons Esau and Jacob buried him."
"1042","Genesis","36","1","This is the account of the family line of Esau (that is, Edom). "
"1043","Genesis","36","2","Esau took his wives from the women of Canaan: Adah daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Oholibamah daughter of Anah and granddaughter of Zibeon the Hivite—  "
"1044","Genesis","36","3","also Basemath daughter of Ishmael and sister of Nebaioth. "
"1045","Genesis","36","4","Adah bore Eliphaz to Esau, Basemath bore Reuel,  "
"1046","Genesis","36","5","and Oholibamah bore Jeush, Jalam and Korah. These were the sons of Esau, who were born to him in Canaan. "
"1047","Genesis","36","6","Esau took his wives and sons and daughters and all the members of his household, as well as his livestock and all his other animals and all the goods he had acquired in Canaan, and moved to a land some distance from his brother Jacob.  "
"1048","Genesis","36","7","Their possessions were too great for them to remain together; the land where they were staying could not support them both because of their livestock.  "
"1049","Genesis","36","8","So Esau (that is, Edom) settled in the hill country of Seir. "
"1050","Genesis","36","9","This is the account of the family line of Esau the father of the Edomites in the hill country of Seir. "
"1051","Genesis","36","10","These are the names of Esau’s sons: Eliphaz, the son of Esau’s wife Adah, and Reuel, the son of Esau’s wife Basemath. "
"1052","Genesis","36","11","The sons of Eliphaz: Teman, Omar, Zepho, Gatam and Kenaz. "
"1053","Genesis","36","12","Esau’s son Eliphaz also had a concubine named Timna, who bore him Amalek. These were grandsons of Esau’s wife Adah. "
"1054","Genesis","36","13","The sons of Reuel: Nahath, Zerah, Shammah and Mizzah. These were grandsons of Esau’s wife Basemath. "
"1055","Genesis","36","14","Jeush, Jalam and Korah. "
"1056","Genesis","36","15","These were the chiefs among Esau’s descendants: The sons of Eliphaz the firstborn of Esau: Chiefs Teman, Omar, Zepho, Kenaz,  "
"1057","Genesis","36","16","Korah,  Gatam and Amalek. These were the chiefs descended from Eliphaz in Edom; they were grandsons of Adah. "
"1058","Genesis","36","17","The sons of Esau’s son Reuel: Chiefs Nahath, Zerah, Shammah and Mizzah. These were the chiefs descended from Reuel in Edom; they were grandsons of Esau’s wife Basemath. "
"1059","Genesis","36","18","The sons of Esau’s wife Oholibamah: Chiefs Jeush, Jalam and Korah. These were the chiefs descended from Esau’s wife Oholibamah daughter of Anah. "
"1060","Genesis","36","19","These were the sons of Esau (that is, Edom), and these were their chiefs. "
"1061","Genesis","36","20","These were the sons of Seir the Horite, who were living in the region: Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon, Anah,  "
"1062","Genesis","36","21","Dishon, Ezer and Dishan. These sons of Seir in Edom were Horite chiefs. "
"1063","Genesis","36","22","The sons of Lotan: Hori and Homam.  Timna was Lotan’s sister. "
"1064","Genesis","36","23","The sons of Shobal: Alvan, Manahath, Ebal, Shepho and Onam. "
"1065","Genesis","36","24","The sons of Zibeon: Aiah and Anah. This is the Anah who discovered the hot springs  in the desert while he was grazing the donkeys of his father Zibeon. "
"1066","Genesis","36","25","The children of Anah: Dishon and Oholibamah daughter of Anah. "
"1067","Genesis","36","26","The sons of Dishon : Hemdan, Eshban, Ithran and Keran. "
"1068","Genesis","36","27","The sons of Ezer: Bilhan, Zaavan and Akan. "
"1069","Genesis","36","28","The sons of Dishan: Uz and Aran. "
"1070","Genesis","36","29","These were the Horite chiefs: Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon, Anah,  "
"1071","Genesis","36","30","Dishon, Ezer and Dishan. These were the Horite chiefs, according to their divisions, in the land of Seir. "
"1072","Genesis","36","31","These were the kings who reigned in Edom before any Israelite king reigned: "
"1073","Genesis","36","32","Bela son of Beor became king of Edom. His city was named Dinhabah. "
"1074","Genesis","36","33","When Bela died, Jobab son of Zerah from Bozrah succeeded him as king. "
"1075","Genesis","36","34","When Jobab died, Husham from the land of the Temanites succeeded him as king. "
"1076","Genesis","36","35","When Husham died, Hadad son of Bedad, who defeated Midian in the country of Moab, succeeded him as king. His city was named Avith. "
"1077","Genesis","36","36","When Hadad died, Samlah from Masrekah succeeded him as king. "
"1078","Genesis","36","37","When Samlah died, Shaul from Rehoboth on the river succeeded him as king. "
"1079","Genesis","36","38","When Shaul died, Baal-Hanan son of Akbor succeeded him as king. "
"1080","Genesis","36","39","When Baal-Hanan son of Akbor died, Hadad  succeeded him as king. His city was named Pau, and his wife’s name was Mehetabel daughter of Matred, the daughter of Me-Zahab. "
"1081","Genesis","36","40","These were the chiefs descended from Esau, by name, according to their clans and regions: Timna, Alvah, Jetheth,  "
"1082","Genesis","36","41","Oholibamah, Elah, Pinon,  "
"1083","Genesis","36","42","Kenaz, Teman, Mibzar,  "
"1084","Genesis","36","43","Magdiel and Iram. These were the chiefs of Edom, according to their settlements in the land they occupied. This is the family line of Esau, the father of the Edomites."
"1085","Genesis","37","1","Jacob lived in the land where his father had stayed, the land of Canaan. "
"1086","Genesis","37","2","This is the account of Jacob’s family line. Joseph, a young man of seventeen, was tending the flocks with his brothers, the sons of Bilhah and the sons of Zilpah, his father’s wives, and he brought their father a bad report about them. "
"1087","Genesis","37","3","Now Israel loved Joseph more than any of his other sons, because he had been born to him in his old age; and he made an ornate  robe for him.  "
"1088","Genesis","37","4","When his brothers saw that their father loved him more than any of them, they hated him and could not speak a kind word to him. "
"1089","Genesis","37","5","Joseph had a dream, and when he told it to his brothers, they hated him all the more.  "
"1090","Genesis","37","6","He said to them, “Listen to this dream I had:  "
"1091","Genesis","37","7","We were binding sheaves of grain out in the field when suddenly my sheaf rose and stood upright, while your sheaves gathered around mine and bowed down to it.” "
"1092","Genesis","37","8","His brothers said to him, “Do you intend to reign over us? Will you actually rule us?” And they hated him all the more because of his dream and what he had said. "
"1093","Genesis","37","9","Then he had another dream, and he told it to his brothers. “Listen,” he said, “I had another dream, and this time the sun and moon and eleven stars were bowing down to me.” "
"1094","Genesis","37","10","When he told his father as well as his brothers, his father rebuked him and said, “What is this dream you had? Will your mother and I and your brothers actually come and bow down to the ground before you?”  "
"1095","Genesis","37","11","His brothers were jealous of him, but his father kept the matter in mind. "
"1096","Genesis","37","12","Now his brothers had gone to graze their father’s flocks near Shechem,  "
"1097","Genesis","37","13","and Israel said to Joseph, “As you know, your brothers are grazing the flocks near Shechem. Come, I am going to send you to them.” “Very well,” he replied. "
"1098","Genesis","37","14","So he said to him, “Go and see if all is well with your brothers and with the flocks, and bring word back to me.” Then he sent him off from the Valley of Hebron. When Joseph arrived at Shechem,  "
"1099","Genesis","37","15","a man found him wandering around in the fields and asked him, “What are you looking for?” "
"1100","Genesis","37","16","He replied, “I’m looking for my brothers. Can you tell me where they are grazing their flocks?” "
"1101","Genesis","37","17","“They have moved on from here,” the man answered. “I heard them say, ‘Let’s go to Dothan.’ ” So Joseph went after his brothers and found them near Dothan.  "
"1102","Genesis","37","18","But they saw him in the distance, and before he reached them, they plotted to kill him. "
"1103","Genesis","37","19","“Here comes that dreamer!” they said to each other.  "
"1104","Genesis","37","20","“Come now, let’s kill him and throw him into one of these cisterns and say that a ferocious animal devoured him. Then we’ll see what comes of his dreams.” "
"1105","Genesis","37","21","When Reuben heard this, he tried to rescue him from their hands. “Let’s not take his life,” he said.  "
"1106","Genesis","37","22","“Don’t shed any blood. Throw him into this cistern here in the wilderness, but don’t lay a hand on him.” Reuben said this to rescue him from them and take him back to his father. "
"1107","Genesis","37","23","So when Joseph came to his brothers, they stripped him of his robe—the ornate robe he was wearing—  "
"1108","Genesis","37","24","and they took him and threw him into the cistern. The cistern was empty; there was no water in it. "
"1109","Genesis","37","25","As they sat down to eat their meal, they looked up and saw a caravan of Ishmaelites coming from Gilead. Their camels were loaded with spices, balm and myrrh, and they were on their way to take them down to Egypt. "
"1110","Genesis","37","26","Judah said to his brothers, “What will we gain if we kill our brother and cover up his blood?  "
"1111","Genesis","37","27","Come, let’s sell him to the Ishmaelites and not lay our hands on him; after all, he is our brother, our own flesh and blood.” His brothers agreed. "
"1112","Genesis","37","28","So when the Midianite merchants came by, his brothers pulled Joseph up out of the cistern and sold him for twenty shekels  of silver to the Ishmaelites, who took him to Egypt. "
"1113","Genesis","37","29","When Reuben returned to the cistern and saw that Joseph was not there, he tore his clothes.  "
"1114","Genesis","37","30","He went back to his brothers and said, “The boy isn’t there! Where can I turn now?” "
"1115","Genesis","37","31","Then they got Joseph’s robe, slaughtered a goat and dipped the robe in the blood.  "
"1116","Genesis","37","32","They took the ornate robe back to their father and said, “We found this. Examine it to see whether it is your son’s robe.” "
"1117","Genesis","37","33","He recognized it and said, “It is my son’s robe! Some ferocious animal has devoured him. Joseph has surely been torn to pieces.” "
"1118","Genesis","37","34","Then Jacob tore his clothes, put on sackcloth and mourned for his son many days.  "
"1119","Genesis","37","35","All his sons and daughters came to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted. “No,” he said, “I will continue to mourn until I join my son in the grave.” So his father wept for him. "
"1120","Genesis","37","36","Meanwhile, the Midianites  sold Joseph in Egypt to Potiphar, one of Pharaoh’s officials, the captain of the guard."
"1121","Genesis","38","1","At that time, Judah left his brothers and went down to stay with a man of Adullam named Hirah.  "
"1122","Genesis","38","2","There Judah met the daughter of a Canaanite man named Shua. He married her and made love to her;  "
"1123","Genesis","38","3","she became pregnant and gave birth to a son, who was named Er.  "
"1124","Genesis","38","4","She conceived again and gave birth to a son and named him Onan.  "
"1125","Genesis","38","5","She gave birth to still another son and named him Shelah. It was at Kezib that she gave birth to him. "
"1126","Genesis","38","6","Judah got a wife for Er, his firstborn, and her name was Tamar.  "
"1127","Genesis","38","7","But Er, Judah’s firstborn, was wicked in the  Lord ’s sight; so the  Lord  put him to death. "
"1128","Genesis","38","8","Then Judah said to Onan, “Sleep with your brother’s wife and fulfill your duty to her as a brother-in-law to raise up offspring for your brother.”  "
"1129","Genesis","38","9","But Onan knew that the child would not be his; so whenever he slept with his brother’s wife, he spilled his semen on the ground to keep from providing offspring for his brother.  "
"1130","Genesis","38","10","What he did was wicked in the  Lord ’s sight; so the  Lord  put him to death also. "
"1131","Genesis","38","11","Judah then said to his daughter-in-law Tamar, “Live as a widow in your father’s household until my son Shelah grows up.” For he thought, “He may die too, just like his brothers.” So Tamar went to live in her father’s household. "
"1132","Genesis","38","12","After a long time Judah’s wife, the daughter of Shua, died. When Judah had recovered from his grief, he went up to Timnah, to the men who were shearing his sheep, and his friend Hirah the Adullamite went with him. "
"1133","Genesis","38","13","When Tamar was told, “Your father-in-law is on his way to Timnah to shear his sheep,”  "
"1134","Genesis","38","14","she took off her widow’s clothes, covered herself with a veil to disguise herself, and then sat down at the entrance to Enaim, which is on the road to Timnah. For she saw that, though Shelah had now grown up, she had not been given to him as his wife. "
"1135","Genesis","38","15","When Judah saw her, he thought she was a prostitute, for she had covered her face.  "
"1136","Genesis","38","16","Not realizing that she was his daughter-in-law, he went over to her by the roadside and said, “Come now, let me sleep with you.” “And what will you give me to sleep with you?” she asked. "
"1137","Genesis","38","17","“I’ll send you a young goat from my flock,” he said. “Will you give me something as a pledge until you send it?” she asked. "
"1138","Genesis","38","18","He said, “What pledge should I give you?” “Your seal and its cord, and the staff in your hand,” she answered. So he gave them to her and slept with her, and she became pregnant by him.  "
"1139","Genesis","38","19","After she left, she took off her veil and put on her widow’s clothes again. "
"1140","Genesis","38","20","Meanwhile Judah sent the young goat by his friend the Adullamite in order to get his pledge back from the woman, but he did not find her.  "
"1141","Genesis","38","21","He asked the men who lived there, “Where is the shrine prostitute who was beside the road at Enaim?” “There hasn’t been any shrine prostitute here,” they said. "
"1142","Genesis","38","22","So he went back to Judah and said, “I didn’t find her. Besides, the men who lived there said, ‘There hasn’t been any shrine prostitute here.’ ” "
"1143","Genesis","38","23","Then Judah said, “Let her keep what she has, or we will become a laughingstock. After all, I did send her this young goat, but you didn’t find her.” "
"1144","Genesis","38","24","About three months later Judah was told, “Your daughter-in-law Tamar is guilty of prostitution, and as a result she is now pregnant.” Judah said, “Bring her out and have her burned to death!” "
"1145","Genesis","38","25","As she was being brought out, she sent a message to her father-in-law. “I am pregnant by the man who owns these,” she said. And she added, “See if you recognize whose seal and cord and staff these are.” "
"1146","Genesis","38","26","Judah recognized them and said, “She is more righteous than I, since I wouldn’t give her to my son Shelah.” And he did not sleep with her again. "
"1147","Genesis","38","27","When the time came for her to give birth, there were twin boys in her womb.  "
"1148","Genesis","38","28","As she was giving birth, one of them put out his hand; so the midwife took a scarlet thread and tied it on his wrist and said, “This one came out first.”  "
"1149","Genesis","38","29","But when he drew back his hand, his brother came out, and she said, “So this is how you have broken out!” And he was named Perez.   "
"1150","Genesis","38","30","Then his brother, who had the scarlet thread on his wrist, came out. And he was named Zerah."
"1151","Genesis","39","1","Now Joseph had been taken down to Egypt. Potiphar, an Egyptian who was one of Pharaoh’s officials, the captain of the guard, bought him from the Ishmaelites who had taken him there. "
"1152","Genesis","39","2","The  Lord  was with Joseph so that he prospered, and he lived in the house of his Egyptian master.  "
"1153","Genesis","39","3","When his master saw that the  Lord  was with him and that the  Lord  gave him success in everything he did,  "
"1154","Genesis","39","4","Joseph found favor in his eyes and became his attendant. Potiphar put him in charge of his household, and he entrusted to his care everything he owned.  "
"1155","Genesis","39","5","From the time he put him in charge of his household and of all that he owned, the  Lord  blessed the household of the Egyptian because of Joseph. The blessing of the  Lord  was on everything Potiphar had, both in the house and in the field.  "
"1156","Genesis","39","6","So Potiphar left everything he had in Joseph’s care; with Joseph in charge, he did not concern himself with anything except the food he ate. Now Joseph was well-built and handsome,  "
"1157","Genesis","39","7","and after a while his master’s wife took notice of Joseph and said, “Come to bed with me!” "
"1158","Genesis","39","8","But he refused. “With me in charge,” he told her, “my master does not concern himself with anything in the house; everything he owns he has entrusted to my care.  "
"1159","Genesis","39","9","No one is greater in this house than I am. My master has withheld nothing from me except you, because you are his wife. How then could I do such a wicked thing and sin against God?”  "
"1160","Genesis","39","10","And though she spoke to Joseph day after day, he refused to go to bed with her or even be with her. "
"1161","Genesis","39","11","One day he went into the house to attend to his duties, and none of the household servants was inside.  "
"1162","Genesis","39","12","She caught him by his cloak and said, “Come to bed with me!” But he left his cloak in her hand and ran out of the house. "
"1163","Genesis","39","13","When she saw that he had left his cloak in her hand and had run out of the house,  "
"1164","Genesis","39","14","she called her household servants. “Look,” she said to them, “this Hebrew has been brought to us to make sport of us! He came in here to sleep with me, but I screamed.  "
"1165","Genesis","39","15","When he heard me scream for help, he left his cloak beside me and ran out of the house.” "
"1166","Genesis","39","16","She kept his cloak beside her until his master came home.  "
"1167","Genesis","39","17","Then she told him this story: “That Hebrew slave you brought us came to me to make sport of me.  "
"1168","Genesis","39","18","But as soon as I screamed for help, he left his cloak beside me and ran out of the house.” "
"1169","Genesis","39","19","When his master heard the story his wife told him, saying, “This is how your slave treated me,” he burned with anger.  "
"1170","Genesis","39","20","Joseph’s master took him and put him in prison, the place where the king’s prisoners were confined. But while Joseph was there in the prison,  "
"1171","Genesis","39","21","the  Lord  was with him; he showed him kindness and granted him favor in the eyes of the prison warden.  "
"1172","Genesis","39","22","So the warden put Joseph in charge of all those held in the prison, and he was made responsible for all that was done there.  "
"1173","Genesis","39","23","The warden paid no attention to anything under Joseph’s care, because the  Lord  was with Joseph and gave him success in whatever he did."
"1174","Genesis","40","1","Some time later, the cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt offended their master, the king of Egypt.  "
"1175","Genesis","40","2","Pharaoh was angry with his two officials, the chief cupbearer and the chief baker,  "
"1176","Genesis","40","3","and put them in custody in the house of the captain of the guard, in the same prison where Joseph was confined.  "
"1177","Genesis","40","4","The captain of the guard assigned them to Joseph, and he attended them. After they had been in custody for some time,  "
"1178","Genesis","40","5","each of the two men—the cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were being held in prison—had a dream the same night, and each dream had a meaning of its own. "
"1179","Genesis","40","6","When Joseph came to them the next morning, he saw that they were dejected.  "
"1180","Genesis","40","7","So he asked Pharaoh’s officials who were in custody with him in his master’s house, “Why do you look so sad today?” "
"1181","Genesis","40","8","“We both had dreams,” they answered, “but there is no one to interpret them.” Then Joseph said to them, “Do not interpretations belong to God? Tell me your dreams.” "
"1182","Genesis","40","9","So the chief cupbearer told Joseph his dream. He said to him, “In my dream I saw a vine in front of me,  "
"1183","Genesis","40","10","and on the vine were three branches. As soon as it budded, it blossomed, and its clusters ripened into grapes.  "
"1184","Genesis","40","11","Pharaoh’s cup was in my hand, and I took the grapes, squeezed them into Pharaoh’s cup and put the cup in his hand.” "
"1185","Genesis","40","12","“This is what it means,” Joseph said to him. “The three branches are three days.  "
"1186","Genesis","40","13","Within three days Pharaoh will lift up your head and restore you to your position, and you will put Pharaoh’s cup in his hand, just as you used to do when you were his cupbearer.  "
"1187","Genesis","40","14","But when all goes well with you, remember me and show me kindness; mention me to Pharaoh and get me out of this prison.  "
"1188","Genesis","40","15","I was forcibly carried off from the land of the Hebrews, and even here I have done nothing to deserve being put in a dungeon.” "
"1189","Genesis","40","16","When the chief baker saw that Joseph had given a favorable interpretation, he said to Joseph, “I too had a dream: On my head were three baskets of bread.   "
"1190","Genesis","40","17","In the top basket were all kinds of baked goods for Pharaoh, but the birds were eating them out of the basket on my head.” "
"1191","Genesis","40","18","“This is what it means,” Joseph said. “The three baskets are three days.  "
"1192","Genesis","40","19","Within three days Pharaoh will lift off your head and impale your body on a pole. And the birds will eat away your flesh.” "
"1193","Genesis","40","20","Now the third day was Pharaoh’s birthday, and he gave a feast for all his officials. He lifted up the heads of the chief cupbearer and the chief baker in the presence of his officials:  "
"1194","Genesis","40","21","He restored the chief cupbearer to his position, so that he once again put the cup into Pharaoh’s hand—  "
"1195","Genesis","40","22","but he impaled the chief baker, just as Joseph had said to them in his interpretation. "
"1196","Genesis","40","23","The chief cupbearer, however, did not remember Joseph; he forgot him."
"1197","Genesis","41","1","When two full years had passed, Pharaoh had a dream: He was standing by the Nile,  "
"1198","Genesis","41","2","when out of the river there came up seven cows, sleek and fat, and they grazed among the reeds.  "
"1199","Genesis","41","3","After them, seven other cows, ugly and gaunt, came up out of the Nile and stood beside those on the riverbank.  "
"1200","Genesis","41","4","And the cows that were ugly and gaunt ate up the seven sleek, fat cows. Then Pharaoh woke up. "
"1201","Genesis","41","5","He fell asleep again and had a second dream: Seven heads of grain, healthy and good, were growing on a single stalk.  "
"1202","Genesis","41","6","After them, seven other heads of grain sprouted—thin and scorched by the east wind.  "
"1203","Genesis","41","7","The thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven healthy, full heads. Then Pharaoh woke up; it had been a dream. "
"1204","Genesis","41","8","In the morning his mind was troubled, so he sent for all the magicians and wise men of Egypt. Pharaoh told them his dreams, but no one could interpret them for him. "
"1205","Genesis","41","9","Then the chief cupbearer said to Pharaoh, “Today I am reminded of my shortcomings.  "
"1206","Genesis","41","10","Pharaoh was once angry with his servants, and he imprisoned me and the chief baker in the house of the captain of the guard.  "
"1207","Genesis","41","11","Each of us had a dream the same night, and each dream had a meaning of its own.  "
"1208","Genesis","41","12","Now a young Hebrew was there with us, a servant of the captain of the guard. We told him our dreams, and he interpreted them for us, giving each man the interpretation of his dream.  "
"1209","Genesis","41","13","And things turned out exactly as he interpreted them to us: I was restored to my position, and the other man was impaled.” "
"1210","Genesis","41","14","So Pharaoh sent for Joseph, and he was quickly brought from the dungeon. When he had shaved and changed his clothes, he came before Pharaoh. "
"1211","Genesis","41","15","Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I had a dream, and no one can interpret it. But I have heard it said of you that when you hear a dream you can interpret it.” "
"1212","Genesis","41","16","“I cannot do it,” Joseph replied to Pharaoh, “but God will give Pharaoh the answer he desires.” "
"1213","Genesis","41","17","Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “In my dream I was standing on the bank of the Nile,  "
"1214","Genesis","41","18","when out of the river there came up seven cows, fat and sleek, and they grazed among the reeds.  "
"1215","Genesis","41","19","After them, seven other cows came up—scrawny and very ugly and lean. I had never seen such ugly cows in all the land of Egypt.  "
"1216","Genesis","41","20","The lean, ugly cows ate up the seven fat cows that came up first.  "
"1217","Genesis","41","21","But even after they ate them, no one could tell that they had done so; they looked just as ugly as before. Then I woke up. "
"1218","Genesis","41","22","“In my dream I saw seven heads of grain, full and good, growing on a single stalk.  "
"1219","Genesis","41","23","After them, seven other heads sprouted—withered and thin and scorched by the east wind.  "
"1220","Genesis","41","24","The thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven good heads. I told this to the magicians, but none of them could explain it to me.” "
"1221","Genesis","41","25","Then Joseph said to Pharaoh, “The dreams of Pharaoh are one and the same. God has revealed to Pharaoh what he is about to do.  "
"1222","Genesis","41","26","The seven good cows are seven years, and the seven good heads of grain are seven years; it is one and the same dream.  "
"1223","Genesis","41","27","The seven lean, ugly cows that came up afterward are seven years, and so are the seven worthless heads of grain scorched by the east wind: They are seven years of famine. "
"1224","Genesis","41","28","“It is just as I said to Pharaoh: God has shown Pharaoh what he is about to do.  "
"1225","Genesis","41","29","Seven years of great abundance are coming throughout the land of Egypt,  "
"1226","Genesis","41","30","but seven years of famine will follow them. Then all the abundance in Egypt will be forgotten, and the famine will ravage the land.  "
"1227","Genesis","41","31","The abundance in the land will not be remembered, because the famine that follows it will be so severe.  "
"1228","Genesis","41","32","The reason the dream was given to Pharaoh in two forms is that the matter has been firmly decided by God, and God will do it soon. "
"1229","Genesis","41","33","“And now let Pharaoh look for a discerning and wise man and put him in charge of the land of Egypt.  "
"1230","Genesis","41","34","Let Pharaoh appoint commissioners over the land to take a fifth of the harvest of Egypt during the seven years of abundance.  "
"1231","Genesis","41","35","They should collect all the food of these good years that are coming and store up the grain under the authority of Pharaoh, to be kept in the cities for food.  "
"1232","Genesis","41","36","This food should be held in reserve for the country, to be used during the seven years of famine that will come upon Egypt, so that the country may not be ruined by the famine.” "
"1233","Genesis","41","37","The plan seemed good to Pharaoh and to all his officials.  "
"1234","Genesis","41","38","So Pharaoh asked them, “Can we find anyone like this man, one in whom is the spirit of God ?” "
"1235","Genesis","41","39","Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Since God has made all this known to you, there is no one so discerning and wise as you.  "
"1236","Genesis","41","40","You shall be in charge of my palace, and all my people are to submit to your orders. Only with respect to the throne will I be greater than you.” "
"1237","Genesis","41","41","So Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I hereby put you in charge of the whole land of Egypt.”  "
"1238","Genesis","41","42","Then Pharaoh took his signet ring from his finger and put it on Joseph’s finger. He dressed him in robes of fine linen and put a gold chain around his neck.  "
"1239","Genesis","41","43","He had him ride in a chariot as his second-in-command,  and people shouted before him, “Make way !” Thus he put him in charge of the whole land of Egypt. "
"1240","Genesis","41","44","Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I am Pharaoh, but without your word no one will lift hand or foot in all Egypt.”  "
"1241","Genesis","41","45","Pharaoh gave Joseph the name Zaphenath-Paneah and gave him Asenath daughter of Potiphera, priest of On,  to be his wife. And Joseph went throughout the land of Egypt. "
"1242","Genesis","41","46","Joseph was thirty years old when he entered the service of Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from Pharaoh’s presence and traveled throughout Egypt.  "
"1243","Genesis","41","47","During the seven years of abundance the land produced plentifully.  "
"1244","Genesis","41","48","Joseph collected all the food produced in those seven years of abundance in Egypt and stored it in the cities. In each city he put the food grown in the fields surrounding it.  "
"1245","Genesis","41","49","Joseph stored up huge quantities of grain, like the sand of the sea; it was so much that he stopped keeping records because it was beyond measure. "
"1246","Genesis","41","50","Before the years of famine came, two sons were born to Joseph by Asenath daughter of Potiphera, priest of On.  "
"1247","Genesis","41","51","Joseph named his firstborn Manasseh  and said, “It is because God has made me forget all my trouble and all my father’s household.”  "
"1248","Genesis","41","52","The second son he named Ephraim  and said, “It is because God has made me fruitful in the land of my suffering.” "
"1249","Genesis","41","53","The seven years of abundance in Egypt came to an end,  "
"1250","Genesis","41","54","and the seven years of famine began, just as Joseph had said. There was famine in all the other lands, but in the whole land of Egypt there was food.  "
"1251","Genesis","41","55","When all Egypt began to feel the famine, the people cried to Pharaoh for food. Then Pharaoh told all the Egyptians, “Go to Joseph and do what he tells you.” "
"1252","Genesis","41","56","When the famine had spread over the whole country, Joseph opened all the storehouses and sold grain to the Egyptians, for the famine was severe throughout Egypt.  "
"1253","Genesis","41","57","And all the world came to Egypt to buy grain from Joseph, because the famine was severe everywhere."
"1254","Genesis","42","1","When Jacob learned that there was grain in Egypt, he said to his sons, “Why do you just keep looking at each other?”  "
"1255","Genesis","42","2","He continued, “I have heard that there is grain in Egypt. Go down there and buy some for us, so that we may live and not die.” "
"1256","Genesis","42","3","Then ten of Joseph’s brothers went down to buy grain from Egypt.  "
"1257","Genesis","42","4","But Jacob did not send Benjamin, Joseph’s brother, with the others, because he was afraid that harm might come to him.  "
"1258","Genesis","42","5","So Israel’s sons were among those who went to buy grain, for there was famine in the land of Canaan also. "
"1259","Genesis","42","6","Now Joseph was the governor of the land, the person who sold grain to all its people. So when Joseph’s brothers arrived, they bowed down to him with their faces to the ground.  "
"1260","Genesis","42","7","As soon as Joseph saw his brothers, he recognized them, but he pretended to be a stranger and spoke harshly to them. “Where do you come from?” he asked. “From the land of Canaan,” they replied, “to buy food.” "
"1261","Genesis","42","8","Although Joseph recognized his brothers, they did not recognize him.  "
"1262","Genesis","42","9","Then he remembered his dreams about them and said to them, “You are spies! You have come to see where our land is unprotected.” "
"1263","Genesis","42","10","“No, my lord,” they answered. “Your servants have come to buy food.  "
"1264","Genesis","42","11","We are all the sons of one man. Your servants are honest men, not spies.” "
"1265","Genesis","42","12","“No!” he said to them. “You have come to see where our land is unprotected.” "
"1266","Genesis","42","13","But they replied, “Your servants were twelve brothers, the sons of one man, who lives in the land of Canaan. The youngest is now with our father, and one is no more.” "
"1267","Genesis","42","14","Joseph said to them, “It is just as I told you: You are spies!  "
"1268","Genesis","42","15","And this is how you will be tested: As surely as Pharaoh lives, you will not leave this place unless your youngest brother comes here.  "
"1269","Genesis","42","16","Send one of your number to get your brother; the rest of you will be kept in prison, so that your words may be tested to see if you are telling the truth. If you are not, then as surely as Pharaoh lives, you are spies!”  "
"1270","Genesis","42","17","And he put them all in custody for three days. "
"1271","Genesis","42","18","On the third day, Joseph said to them, “Do this and you will live, for I fear God:  "
"1272","Genesis","42","19","If you are honest men, let one of your brothers stay here in prison, while the rest of you go and take grain back for your starving households.  "
"1273","Genesis","42","20","But you must bring your youngest brother to me, so that your words may be verified and that you may not die.” This they proceeded to do. "
"1274","Genesis","42","21","They said to one another, “Surely we are being punished because of our brother. We saw how distressed he was when he pleaded with us for his life, but we would not listen; that’s why this distress has come on us.” "
"1275","Genesis","42","22","Reuben replied, “Didn’t I tell you not to sin against the boy? But you wouldn’t listen! Now we must give an accounting for his blood.”  "
"1276","Genesis","42","23","They did not realize that Joseph could understand them, since he was using an interpreter. "
"1277","Genesis","42","24","He turned away from them and began to weep, but then came back and spoke to them again. He had Simeon taken from them and bound before their eyes. "
"1278","Genesis","42","25","Joseph gave orders to fill their bags with grain, to put each man’s silver back in his sack, and to give them provisions for their journey. After this was done for them,  "
"1279","Genesis","42","26","they loaded their grain on their donkeys and left. "
"1280","Genesis","42","27","At the place where they stopped for the night one of them opened his sack to get feed for his donkey, and he saw his silver in the mouth of his sack.  "
"1281","Genesis","42","28","“My silver has been returned,” he said to his brothers. “Here it is in my sack.” Their hearts sank and they turned to each other trembling and said, “What is this that God has done to us?” "
"1282","Genesis","42","29","When they came to their father Jacob in the land of Canaan, they told him all that had happened to them. They said,  "
"1283","Genesis","42","30","“The man who is lord over the land spoke harshly to us and treated us as though we were spying on the land.  "
"1284","Genesis","42","31","But we said to him, ‘We are honest men; we are not spies.  "
"1285","Genesis","42","32","We were twelve brothers, sons of one father. One is no more, and the youngest is now with our father in Canaan.’ "
"1286","Genesis","42","33","“Then the man who is lord over the land said to us, ‘This is how I will know whether you are honest men: Leave one of your brothers here with me, and take food for your starving households and go.  "
"1287","Genesis","42","34","But bring your youngest brother to me so I will know that you are not spies but honest men. Then I will give your brother back to you, and you can trade  in the land.’ ” "
"1288","Genesis","42","35","As they were emptying their sacks, there in each man’s sack was his pouch of silver! When they and their father saw the money pouches, they were frightened.  "
"1289","Genesis","42","36","Their father Jacob said to them, “You have deprived me of my children. Joseph is no more and Simeon is no more, and now you want to take Benjamin. Everything is against me!” "
"1290","Genesis","42","37","Then Reuben said to his father, “You may put both of my sons to death if I do not bring him back to you. Entrust him to my care, and I will bring him back.” "
"1291","Genesis","42","38","But Jacob said, “My son will not go down there with you; his brother is dead and he is the only one left. If harm comes to him on the journey you are taking, you will bring my gray head down to the grave in sorrow.”"
"1292","Genesis","43","1","Now the famine was still severe in the land.  "
"1293","Genesis","43","2","So when they had eaten all the grain they had brought from Egypt, their father said to them, “Go back and buy us a little more food.” "
"1294","Genesis","43","3","But Judah said to him, “The man warned us solemnly, ‘You will not see my face again unless your brother is with you.’  "
"1295","Genesis","43","4","If you will send our brother along with us, we will go down and buy food for you.  "
"1296","Genesis","43","5","But if you will not send him, we will not go down, because the man said to us, ‘You will not see my face again unless your brother is with you.’ ” "
"1297","Genesis","43","6","Israel asked, “Why did you bring this trouble on me by telling the man you had another brother?” "
"1298","Genesis","43","7","They replied, “The man questioned us closely about ourselves and our family. ‘Is your father still living?’ he asked us. ‘Do you have another brother?’ We simply answered his questions. How were we to know he would say, ‘Bring your brother down here’?” "
"1299","Genesis","43","8","Then Judah said to Israel his father, “Send the boy along with me and we will go at once, so that we and you and our children may live and not die.  "
"1300","Genesis","43","9","I myself will guarantee his safety; you can hold me personally responsible for him. If I do not bring him back to you and set him here before you, I will bear the blame before you all my life.  "
"1301","Genesis","43","10","As it is, if we had not delayed, we could have gone and returned twice.” "
"1302","Genesis","43","11","Then their father Israel said to them, “If it must be, then do this: Put some of the best products of the land in your bags and take them down to the man as a gift—a little balm and a little honey, some spices and myrrh, some pistachio nuts and almonds.  "
"1303","Genesis","43","12","Take double the amount of silver with you, for you must return the silver that was put back into the mouths of your sacks. Perhaps it was a mistake.  "
"1304","Genesis","43","13","Take your brother also and go back to the man at once.  "
"1305","Genesis","43","14","And may God Almighty  grant you mercy before the man so that he will let your other brother and Benjamin come back with you. As for me, if I am bereaved, I am bereaved.” "
"1306","Genesis","43","15","So the men took the gifts and double the amount of silver, and Benjamin also. They hurried down to Egypt and presented themselves to Joseph.  "
"1307","Genesis","43","16","When Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the steward of his house, “Take these men to my house, slaughter an animal and prepare a meal; they are to eat with me at noon.” "
"1308","Genesis","43","17","The man did as Joseph told him and took the men to Joseph’s house.  "
"1309","Genesis","43","18","Now the men were frightened when they were taken to his house. They thought, “We were brought here because of the silver that was put back into our sacks the first time. He wants to attack us and overpower us and seize us as slaves and take our donkeys.” "
"1310","Genesis","43","19","So they went up to Joseph’s steward and spoke to him at the entrance to the house.  "
"1311","Genesis","43","20","“We beg your pardon, our lord,” they said, “we came down here the first time to buy food.  "
"1312","Genesis","43","21","But at the place where we stopped for the night we opened our sacks and each of us found his silver—the exact weight—in the mouth of his sack. So we have brought it back with us.  "
"1313","Genesis","43","22","We have also brought additional silver with us to buy food. We don’t know who put our silver in our sacks.” "
"1314","Genesis","43","23","“It’s all right,” he said. “Don’t be afraid. Your God, the God of your father, has given you treasure in your sacks; I received your silver.” Then he brought Simeon out to them. "
"1315","Genesis","43","24","The steward took the men into Joseph’s house, gave them water to wash their feet and provided fodder for their donkeys.  "
"1316","Genesis","43","25","They prepared their gifts for Joseph’s arrival at noon, because they had heard that they were to eat there. "
"1317","Genesis","43","26","When Joseph came home, they presented to him the gifts they had brought into the house, and they bowed down before him to the ground.  "
"1318","Genesis","43","27","He asked them how they were, and then he said, “How is your aged father you told me about? Is he still living?” "
"1319","Genesis","43","28","They replied, “Your servant our father is still alive and well.” And they bowed down, prostrating themselves before him. "
"1320","Genesis","43","29","As he looked about and saw his brother Benjamin, his own mother’s son, he asked, “Is this your youngest brother, the one you told me about?” And he said, “God be gracious to you, my son.”  "
"1321","Genesis","43","30","Deeply moved at the sight of his brother, Joseph hurried out and looked for a place to weep. He went into his private room and wept there. "
"1322","Genesis","43","31","After he had washed his face, he came out and, controlling himself, said, “Serve the food.” "
"1323","Genesis","43","32","They served him by himself, the brothers by themselves, and the Egyptians who ate with him by themselves, because Egyptians could not eat with Hebrews, for that is detestable to Egyptians.  "
"1324","Genesis","43","33","The men had been seated before him in the order of their ages, from the firstborn to the youngest; and they looked at each other in astonishment.  "
"1325","Genesis","43","34","When portions were served to them from Joseph’s table, Benjamin’s portion was five times as much as anyone else’s. So they feasted and drank freely with him."
"1326","Genesis","44","1","Now Joseph gave these instructions to the steward of his house: “Fill the men’s sacks with as much food as they can carry, and put each man’s silver in the mouth of his sack.  "
"1327","Genesis","44","2","Then put my cup, the silver one, in the mouth of the youngest one’s sack, along with the silver for his grain.” And he did as Joseph said. "
"1328","Genesis","44","3","As morning dawned, the men were sent on their way with their donkeys.  "
"1329","Genesis","44","4","They had not gone far from the city when Joseph said to his steward, “Go after those men at once, and when you catch up with them, say to them, ‘Why have you repaid good with evil?  "
"1330","Genesis","44","5","Isn’t this the cup my master drinks from and also uses for divination? This is a wicked thing you have done.’ ” "
"1331","Genesis","44","6","When he caught up with them, he repeated these words to them.  "
"1332","Genesis","44","7","But they said to him, “Why does my lord say such things? Far be it from your servants to do anything like that!  "
"1333","Genesis","44","8","We even brought back to you from the land of Canaan the silver we found inside the mouths of our sacks. So why would we steal silver or gold from your master’s house?  "
"1334","Genesis","44","9","If any of your servants is found to have it, he will die; and the rest of us will become my lord’s slaves.” "
"1335","Genesis","44","10","“Very well, then,” he said, “let it be as you say. Whoever is found to have it will become my slave; the rest of you will be free from blame.” "
"1336","Genesis","44","11","Each of them quickly lowered his sack to the ground and opened it.  "
"1337","Genesis","44","12","Then the steward proceeded to search, beginning with the oldest and ending with the youngest. And the cup was found in Benjamin’s sack.  "
"1338","Genesis","44","13","At this, they tore their clothes. Then they all loaded their donkeys and returned to the city. "
"1339","Genesis","44","14","Joseph was still in the house when Judah and his brothers came in, and they threw themselves to the ground before him.  "
"1340","Genesis","44","15","Joseph said to them, “What is this you have done? Don’t you know that a man like me can find things out by divination?” "
"1341","Genesis","44","16","“What can we say to my lord?” Judah replied. “What can we say? How can we prove our innocence? God has uncovered your servants’ guilt. We are now my lord’s slaves—we ourselves and the one who was found to have the cup.” "
"1342","Genesis","44","17","But Joseph said, “Far be it from me to do such a thing! Only the man who was found to have the cup will become my slave. The rest of you, go back to your father in peace.” "
"1343","Genesis","44","18","Then Judah went up to him and said: “Pardon your servant, my lord, let me speak a word to my lord. Do not be angry with your servant, though you are equal to Pharaoh himself.  "
"1344","Genesis","44","19","My lord asked his servants, ‘Do you have a father or a brother?’  "
"1345","Genesis","44","20","And we answered, ‘We have an aged father, and there is a young son born to him in his old age. His brother is dead, and he is the only one of his mother’s sons left, and his father loves him.’ "
"1346","Genesis","44","21","“Then you said to your servants, ‘Bring him down to me so I can see him for myself.’  "
"1347","Genesis","44","22","And we said to my lord, ‘The boy cannot leave his father; if he leaves him, his father will die.’  "
"1348","Genesis","44","23","But you told your servants, ‘Unless your youngest brother comes down with you, you will not see my face again.’  "
"1349","Genesis","44","24","When we went back to your servant my father, we told him what my lord had said. "
"1350","Genesis","44","25","“Then our father said, ‘Go back and buy a little more food.’  "
"1351","Genesis","44","26","But we said, ‘We cannot go down. Only if our youngest brother is with us will we go. We cannot see the man’s face unless our youngest brother is with us.’ "
"1352","Genesis","44","27","“Your servant my father said to us, ‘You know that my wife bore me two sons.  "
"1353","Genesis","44","28","One of them went away from me, and I said, “He has surely been torn to pieces.” And I have not seen him since.  "
"1354","Genesis","44","29","If you take this one from me too and harm comes to him, you will bring my gray head down to the grave in misery.’ "
"1355","Genesis","44","30","“So now, if the boy is not with us when I go back to your servant my father, and if my father, whose life is closely bound up with the boy’s life,  "
"1356","Genesis","44","31","sees that the boy isn’t there, he will die. Your servants will bring the gray head of our father down to the grave in sorrow.  "
"1357","Genesis","44","32","Your servant guaranteed the boy’s safety to my father. I said, ‘If I do not bring him back to you, I will bear the blame before you, my father, all my life!’ "
"1358","Genesis","44","33","“Now then, please let your servant remain here as my lord’s slave in place of the boy, and let the boy return with his brothers.  "
"1359","Genesis","44","34","How can I go back to my father if the boy is not with me? No! Do not let me see the misery that would come on my father.”"
"1360","Genesis","45","1","Then Joseph could no longer control himself before all his attendants, and he cried out, “Have everyone leave my presence!” So there was no one with Joseph when he made himself known to his brothers.  "
"1361","Genesis","45","2","And he wept so loudly that the Egyptians heard him, and Pharaoh’s household heard about it. "
"1362","Genesis","45","3","Joseph said to his brothers, “I am Joseph! Is my father still living?” But his brothers were not able to answer him, because they were terrified at his presence. "
"1363","Genesis","45","4","Then Joseph said to his brothers, “Come close to me.” When they had done so, he said, “I am your brother Joseph, the one you sold into Egypt!  "
"1364","Genesis","45","5","And now, do not be distressed and do not be angry with yourselves for selling me here, because it was to save lives that God sent me ahead of you.  "
"1365","Genesis","45","6","For two years now there has been famine in the land, and for the next five years there will be no plowing and reaping.  "
"1366","Genesis","45","7","But God sent me ahead of you to preserve for you a remnant on earth and to save your lives by a great deliverance. "
"1367","Genesis","45","8","“So then, it was not you who sent me here, but God. He made me father to Pharaoh, lord of his entire household and ruler of all Egypt.  "
"1368","Genesis","45","9","Now hurry back to my father and say to him, ‘This is what your son Joseph says: God has made me lord of all Egypt. Come down to me; don’t delay.  "
"1369","Genesis","45","10","You shall live in the region of Goshen and be near me—you, your children and grandchildren, your flocks and herds, and all you have.  "
"1370","Genesis","45","11","I will provide for you there, because five years of famine are still to come. Otherwise you and your household and all who belong to you will become destitute.’ "
"1371","Genesis","45","12","“You can see for yourselves, and so can my brother Benjamin, that it is really I who am speaking to you.  "
"1372","Genesis","45","13","Tell my father about all the honor accorded me in Egypt and about everything you have seen. And bring my father down here quickly.” "
"1373","Genesis","45","14","Then he threw his arms around his brother Benjamin and wept, and Benjamin embraced him, weeping.  "
"1374","Genesis","45","15","And he kissed all his brothers and wept over them. Afterward his brothers talked with him. "
"1375","Genesis","45","16","When the news reached Pharaoh’s palace that Joseph’s brothers had come, Pharaoh and all his officials were pleased.  "
"1376","Genesis","45","17","Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Tell your brothers, ‘Do this: Load your animals and return to the land of Canaan,  "
"1377","Genesis","45","18","and bring your father and your families back to me. I will give you the best of the land of Egypt and you can enjoy the fat of the land.’ "
"1378","Genesis","45","19","“You are also directed to tell them, ‘Do this: Take some carts from Egypt for your children and your wives, and get your father and come.  "
"1379","Genesis","45","20","Never mind about your belongings, because the best of all Egypt will be yours.’ ” "
"1380","Genesis","45","21","So the sons of Israel did this. Joseph gave them carts, as Pharaoh had commanded, and he also gave them provisions for their journey.  "
"1381","Genesis","45","22","To each of them he gave new clothing, but to Benjamin he gave three hundred shekels  of silver and five sets of clothes.  "
"1382","Genesis","45","23","And this is what he sent to his father: ten donkeys loaded with the best things of Egypt, and ten female donkeys loaded with grain and bread and other provisions for his journey.  "
"1383","Genesis","45","24","Then he sent his brothers away, and as they were leaving he said to them, “Don’t quarrel on the way!” "
"1384","Genesis","45","25","So they went up out of Egypt and came to their father Jacob in the land of Canaan.  "
"1385","Genesis","45","26","They told him, “Joseph is still alive! In fact, he is ruler of all Egypt.” Jacob was stunned; he did not believe them.  "
"1386","Genesis","45","27","But when they told him everything Joseph had said to them, and when he saw the carts Joseph had sent to carry him back, the spirit of their father Jacob revived.  "
"1387","Genesis","45","28","And Israel said, “I’m convinced! My son Joseph is still alive. I will go and see him before I die.”"
"1388","Genesis","46","1","So Israel set out with all that was his, and when he reached Beersheba, he offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac. "
"1389","Genesis","46","2","And God spoke to Israel in a vision at night and said, “Jacob! Jacob!” “Here I am,” he replied. "
"1390","Genesis","46","3","“I am God, the God of your father,” he said. “Do not be afraid to go down to Egypt, for I will make you into a great nation there.  "
"1391","Genesis","46","4","I will go down to Egypt with you, and I will surely bring you back again. And Joseph’s own hand will close your eyes.” "
"1392","Genesis","46","5","Then Jacob left Beersheba, and Israel’s sons took their father Jacob and their children and their wives in the carts that Pharaoh had sent to transport him.  "
"1393","Genesis","46","6","So Jacob and all his offspring went to Egypt, taking with them their livestock and the possessions they had acquired in Canaan.  "
"1394","Genesis","46","7","Jacob brought with him to Egypt his sons and grandsons and his daughters and granddaughters—all his offspring. "
"1395","Genesis","46","8","These are the names of the sons of Israel (Jacob and his descendants) who went to Egypt: Reuben the firstborn of Jacob. "
"1396","Genesis","46","9","The sons of Reuben: Hanok, Pallu, Hezron and Karmi. "
"1397","Genesis","46","10","The sons of Simeon: Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jakin, Zohar and Shaul the son of a Canaanite woman. "
"1398","Genesis","46","11","The sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath and Merari. "
"1399","Genesis","46","12","The sons of Judah: Er, Onan, Shelah, Perez and Zerah (but Er and Onan had died in the land of Canaan). The sons of Perez: "
"1400","Genesis","46","13","The sons of Issachar: Tola, Puah,  Jashub  and Shimron. "
"1401","Genesis","46","14","The sons of Zebulun: Sered, Elon and Jahleel. "
"1402","Genesis","46","15","These were the sons Leah bore to Jacob in Paddan Aram,  besides his daughter Dinah. These sons and daughters of his were thirty-three in all. "
"1403","Genesis","46","16","The sons of Gad: Zephon,  Haggi, Shuni, Ezbon, Eri, Arodi and Areli. "
"1404","Genesis","46","17","The sons of Asher: Imnah, Ishvah, Ishvi and Beriah. Their sister was Serah. The sons of Beriah: "
"1405","Genesis","46","18","These were the children born to Jacob by Zilpah, whom Laban had given to his daughter Leah—sixteen in all. "
"1406","Genesis","46","19","The sons of Jacob’s wife Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin.  "
"1407","Genesis","46","20","In Egypt, Manasseh and Ephraim were born to Joseph by Asenath daughter of Potiphera, priest of On. "
"1408","Genesis","46","21","The sons of Benjamin: Bela, Beker, Ashbel, Gera, Naaman, Ehi, Rosh, Muppim, Huppim and Ard. "
"1409","Genesis","46","22","These were the sons of Rachel who were born to Jacob—fourteen in all. "
"1410","Genesis","46","23","The son of Dan: Hushim. "
"1411","Genesis","46","24","The sons of Naphtali: Jahziel, Guni, Jezer and Shillem. "
"1412","Genesis","46","25","These were the sons born to Jacob by Bilhah, whom Laban had given to his daughter Rachel—seven in all. "
"1413","Genesis","46","26","All those who went to Egypt with Jacob—those who were his direct descendants, not counting his sons’ wives—numbered sixty-six persons.  "
"1414","Genesis","46","27","With the two sons  who had been born to Joseph in Egypt, the members of Jacob’s family, which went to Egypt, were seventy  in all. "
"1415","Genesis","46","28","Now Jacob sent Judah ahead of him to Joseph to get directions to Goshen. When they arrived in the region of Goshen,  "
"1416","Genesis","46","29","Joseph had his chariot made ready and went to Goshen to meet his father Israel. As soon as Joseph appeared before him, he threw his arms around his father  and wept for a long time. "
"1417","Genesis","46","30","Israel said to Joseph, “Now I am ready to die, since I have seen for myself that you are still alive.” "
"1418","Genesis","46","31","Then Joseph said to his brothers and to his father’s household, “I will go up and speak to Pharaoh and will say to him, ‘My brothers and my father’s household, who were living in the land of Canaan, have come to me.  "
"1419","Genesis","46","32","The men are shepherds; they tend livestock, and they have brought along their flocks and herds and everything they own.’  "
"1420","Genesis","46","33","When Pharaoh calls you in and asks, ‘What is your occupation?’  "
"1421","Genesis","46","34","you should answer, ‘Your servants have tended livestock from our boyhood on, just as our fathers did.’ Then you will be allowed to settle in the region of Goshen, for all shepherds are detestable to the Egyptians.”"
"1422","Genesis","47","1","Joseph went and told Pharaoh, “My father and brothers, with their flocks and herds and everything they own, have come from the land of Canaan and are now in Goshen.”  "
"1423","Genesis","47","2","He chose five of his brothers and presented them before Pharaoh. "
"1424","Genesis","47","3","Pharaoh asked the brothers, “What is your occupation?” “Your servants are shepherds,” they replied to Pharaoh, “just as our fathers were.”  "
"1425","Genesis","47","4","They also said to him, “We have come to live here for a while, because the famine is severe in Canaan and your servants’ flocks have no pasture. So now, please let your servants settle in Goshen.” "
"1426","Genesis","47","5","Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Your father and your brothers have come to you,  "
"1427","Genesis","47","6","and the land of Egypt is before you; settle your father and your brothers in the best part of the land. Let them live in Goshen. And if you know of any among them with special ability, put them in charge of my own livestock.” "
"1428","Genesis","47","7","Then Joseph brought his father Jacob in and presented him before Pharaoh. After Jacob blessed  Pharaoh,  "
"1429","Genesis","47","8","Pharaoh asked him, “How old are you?” "
"1430","Genesis","47","9","And Jacob said to Pharaoh, “The years of my pilgrimage are a hundred and thirty. My years have been few and difficult, and they do not equal the years of the pilgrimage of my fathers.”  "
"1431","Genesis","47","10","Then Jacob blessed  Pharaoh and went out from his presence. "
"1432","Genesis","47","11","So Joseph settled his father and his brothers in Egypt and gave them property in the best part of the land, the district of Rameses, as Pharaoh directed.  "
"1433","Genesis","47","12","Joseph also provided his father and his brothers and all his father’s household with food, according to the number of their children. "
"1434","Genesis","47","13","There was no food, however, in the whole region because the famine was severe; both Egypt and Canaan wasted away because of the famine.  "
"1435","Genesis","47","14","Joseph collected all the money that was to be found in Egypt and Canaan in payment for the grain they were buying, and he brought it to Pharaoh’s palace.  "
"1436","Genesis","47","15","When the money of the people of Egypt and Canaan was gone, all Egypt came to Joseph and said, “Give us food. Why should we die before your eyes? Our money is all gone.” "
"1437","Genesis","47","16","“Then bring your livestock,” said Joseph. “I will sell you food in exchange for your livestock, since your money is gone.”  "
"1438","Genesis","47","17","So they brought their livestock to Joseph, and he gave them food in exchange for their horses, their sheep and goats, their cattle and donkeys. And he brought them through that year with food in exchange for all their livestock. "
"1439","Genesis","47","18","When that year was over, they came to him the following year and said, “We cannot hide from our lord the fact that since our money is gone and our livestock belongs to you, there is nothing left for our lord except our bodies and our land.  "
"1440","Genesis","47","19","Why should we perish before your eyes—we and our land as well? Buy us and our land in exchange for food, and we with our land will be in bondage to Pharaoh. Give us seed so that we may live and not die, and that the land may not become desolate.” "
"1441","Genesis","47","20","So Joseph bought all the land in Egypt for Pharaoh. The Egyptians, one and all, sold their fields, because the famine was too severe for them. The land became Pharaoh’s,  "
"1442","Genesis","47","21","and Joseph reduced the people to servitude,  from one end of Egypt to the other.  "
"1443","Genesis","47","22","However, he did not buy the land of the priests, because they received a regular allotment from Pharaoh and had food enough from the allotment Pharaoh gave them. That is why they did not sell their land. "
"1444","Genesis","47","23","Joseph said to the people, “Now that I have bought you and your land today for Pharaoh, here is seed for you so you can plant the ground.  "
"1445","Genesis","47","24","But when the crop comes in, give a fifth of it to Pharaoh. The other four-fifths you may keep as seed for the fields and as food for yourselves and your households and your children.” "
"1446","Genesis","47","25","“You have saved our lives,” they said. “May we find favor in the eyes of our lord; we will be in bondage to Pharaoh.” "
"1447","Genesis","47","26","So Joseph established it as a law concerning land in Egypt—still in force today—that a fifth of the produce belongs to Pharaoh. It was only the land of the priests that did not become Pharaoh’s. "
"1448","Genesis","47","27","Now the Israelites settled in Egypt in the region of Goshen. They acquired property there and were fruitful and increased greatly in number. "
"1449","Genesis","47","28","Jacob lived in Egypt seventeen years, and the years of his life were a hundred and forty-seven.  "
"1450","Genesis","47","29","When the time drew near for Israel to die, he called for his son Joseph and said to him, “If I have found favor in your eyes, put your hand under my thigh and promise that you will show me kindness and faithfulness. Do not bury me in Egypt,  "
"1451","Genesis","47","30","but when I rest with my fathers, carry me out of Egypt and bury me where they are buried.” “I will do as you say,” he said. "
"1452","Genesis","47","31","“Swear to me,” he said. Then Joseph swore to him, and Israel worshiped as he leaned on the top of his staff."
"1453","Genesis","48","1","Some time later Joseph was told, “Your father is ill.” So he took his two sons Manasseh and Ephraim along with him.  "
"1454","Genesis","48","2","When Jacob was told, “Your son Joseph has come to you,” Israel rallied his strength and sat up on the bed. "
"1455","Genesis","48","3","Jacob said to Joseph, “God Almighty  appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and there he blessed me  "
"1456","Genesis","48","4","and said to me, ‘I am going to make you fruitful and increase your numbers. I will make you a community of peoples, and I will give this land as an everlasting possession to your descendants after you.’ "
"1457","Genesis","48","5","“Now then, your two sons born to you in Egypt before I came to you here will be reckoned as mine; Ephraim and Manasseh will be mine, just as Reuben and Simeon are mine.  "
"1458","Genesis","48","6","Any children born to you after them will be yours; in the territory they inherit they will be reckoned under the names of their brothers.  "
"1459","Genesis","48","7","As I was returning from Paddan,  to my sorrow Rachel died in the land of Canaan while we were still on the way, a little distance from Ephrath. So I buried her there beside the road to Ephrath” (that is, Bethlehem). "
"1460","Genesis","48","8","When Israel saw the sons of Joseph, he asked, “Who are these?” "
"1461","Genesis","48","9","“They are the sons God has given me here,” Joseph said to his father. Then Israel said, “Bring them to me so I may bless them.” "
"1462","Genesis","48","10","Now Israel’s eyes were failing because of old age, and he could hardly see. So Joseph brought his sons close to him, and his father kissed them and embraced them. "
"1463","Genesis","48","11","Israel said to Joseph, “I never expected to see your face again, and now God has allowed me to see your children too.” "
"1464","Genesis","48","12","Then Joseph removed them from Israel’s knees and bowed down with his face to the ground.  "
"1465","Genesis","48","13","And Joseph took both of them, Ephraim on his right toward Israel’s left hand and Manasseh on his left toward Israel’s right hand, and brought them close to him.  "
"1466","Genesis","48","14","But Israel reached out his right hand and put it on Ephraim’s head, though he was the younger, and crossing his arms, he put his left hand on Manasseh’s head, even though Manasseh was the firstborn. "
"1467","Genesis","48","15","Then he blessed Joseph and said, “May the God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked faithfully, the God who has been my shepherd all my life to this day, "
"1468","Genesis","48","16","the Angel who has delivered me from all harm —may he bless these boys. May they be called by my name and the names of my fathers Abraham and Isaac, and may they increase greatly on the earth.” "
"1469","Genesis","48","17","When Joseph saw his father placing his right hand on Ephraim’s head he was displeased; so he took hold of his father’s hand to move it from Ephraim’s head to Manasseh’s head.  "
"1470","Genesis","48","18","Joseph said to him, “No, my father, this one is the firstborn; put your right hand on his head.” "
"1471","Genesis","48","19","But his father refused and said, “I know, my son, I know. He too will become a people, and he too will become great. Nevertheless, his younger brother will be greater than he, and his descendants will become a group of nations.”  "
"1472","Genesis","48","20","He blessed them that day and said, “In your  name will Israel pronounce this blessing: ‘May God make you like Ephraim and Manasseh.’ ” So he put Ephraim ahead of Manasseh. "
"1473","Genesis","48","21","Then Israel said to Joseph, “I am about to die, but God will be with you  and take you  back to the land of your  fathers.  "
"1474","Genesis","48","22","And to you I give one more ridge of land  than to your brothers, the ridge I took from the Amorites with my sword and my bow.”"
"1475","Genesis","49","1","Then Jacob called for his sons and said: “Gather around so I can tell you what will happen to you in days to come. "
"1476","Genesis","49","2","“Assemble and listen, sons of Jacob; listen to your father Israel. "
"1477","Genesis","49","3","“Reuben, you are my firstborn, my might, the first sign of my strength, excelling in honor, excelling in power. "
"1478","Genesis","49","4","Turbulent as the waters, you will no longer excel, for you went up onto your father’s bed, onto my couch and defiled it. "
"1479","Genesis","49","5","“Simeon and Levi are brothers— their swords  are weapons of violence. "
"1480","Genesis","49","6","Let me not enter their council, let me not join their assembly, for they have killed men in their anger and hamstrung oxen as they pleased. "
"1481","Genesis","49","7","Cursed be their anger, so fierce, and their fury, so cruel! I will scatter them in Jacob and disperse them in Israel. "
"1482","Genesis","49","8","“Judah,  your brothers will praise you; your hand will be on the neck of your enemies; your father’s sons will bow down to you. "
"1483","Genesis","49","9","You are a lion’s cub, Judah; you return from the prey, my son. Like a lion he crouches and lies down, like a lioness—who dares to rouse him? "
"1484","Genesis","49","10","The scepter will not depart from Judah, nor the ruler’s staff from between his feet, until he to whom it belongs  shall come and the obedience of the nations shall be his. "
"1485","Genesis","49","11","He will tether his donkey to a vine, his colt to the choicest branch; he will wash his garments in wine, his robes in the blood of grapes. "
"1486","Genesis","49","12","His eyes will be darker than wine, his teeth whiter than milk. "
"1487","Genesis","49","13","“Zebulun will live by the seashore and become a haven for ships; his border will extend toward Sidon. "
"1488","Genesis","49","14","“Issachar is a rawboned  donkey lying down among the sheep pens. "
"1489","Genesis","49","15","When he sees how good is his resting place and how pleasant is his land, he will bend his shoulder to the burden and submit to forced labor. "
"1490","Genesis","49","16","“Dan  will provide justice for his people as one of the tribes of Israel. "
"1491","Genesis","49","17","Dan will be a snake by the roadside, a viper along the path, that bites the horse’s heels so that its rider tumbles backward. "
"1492","Genesis","49","18","“I look for your deliverance,  Lord . "
"1493","Genesis","49","19","“Gad  will be attacked by a band of raiders, but he will attack them at their heels. "
"1494","Genesis","49","20","“Asher’s food will be rich; he will provide delicacies fit for a king. "
"1495","Genesis","49","21","“Naphtali is a doe set free that bears beautiful fawns. "
"1496","Genesis","49","22","“Joseph is a fruitful vine, a fruitful vine near a spring, whose branches climb over a wall. "
"1497","Genesis","49","23","With bitterness archers attacked him; they shot at him with hostility. "
"1498","Genesis","49","24","But his bow remained steady, his strong arms stayed  limber, because of the hand of the Mighty One of Jacob, because of the Shepherd, the Rock of Israel, "
"1499","Genesis","49","25","because of your father’s God, who helps you, because of the Almighty,  who blesses you with blessings of the skies above, blessings of the deep springs below, blessings of the breast and womb. "
"1500","Genesis","49","26","Your father’s blessings are greater than the blessings of the ancient mountains, than  the bounty of the age-old hills. Let all these rest on the head of Joseph, on the brow of the prince among  his brothers. "
"1501","Genesis","49","27","“Benjamin is a ravenous wolf; in the morning he devours the prey, in the evening he divides the plunder.” "
"1502","Genesis","49","28","All these are the twelve tribes of Israel, and this is what their father said to them when he blessed them, giving each the blessing appropriate to him. "
"1503","Genesis","49","29","Then he gave them these instructions: “I am about to be gathered to my people. Bury me with my fathers in the cave in the field of Ephron the Hittite,  "
"1504","Genesis","49","30","the cave in the field of Machpelah, near Mamre in Canaan, which Abraham bought along with the field as a burial place from Ephron the Hittite.  "
"1505","Genesis","49","31","There Abraham and his wife Sarah were buried, there Isaac and his wife Rebekah were buried, and there I buried Leah.  "
"1506","Genesis","49","32","The field and the cave in it were bought from the Hittites. ” "
"1507","Genesis","49","33","When Jacob had finished giving instructions to his sons, he drew his feet up into the bed, breathed his last and was gathered to his people."
"1508","Genesis","50","1","Joseph threw himself on his father and wept over him and kissed him.  "
"1509","Genesis","50","2","Then Joseph directed the physicians in his service to embalm his father Israel. So the physicians embalmed him,  "
"1510","Genesis","50","3","taking a full forty days, for that was the time required for embalming. And the Egyptians mourned for him seventy days. "
"1511","Genesis","50","4","When the days of mourning had passed, Joseph said to Pharaoh’s court, “If I have found favor in your eyes, speak to Pharaoh for me. Tell him,  "
"1512","Genesis","50","5","‘My father made me swear an oath and said, “I am about to die; bury me in the tomb I dug for myself in the land of Canaan.” Now let me go up and bury my father; then I will return.’ ” "
"1513","Genesis","50","6","Pharaoh said, “Go up and bury your father, as he made you swear to do.” "
"1514","Genesis","50","7","So Joseph went up to bury his father. All Pharaoh’s officials accompanied him—the dignitaries of his court and all the dignitaries of Egypt—  "
"1515","Genesis","50","8","besides all the members of Joseph’s household and his brothers and those belonging to his father’s household. Only their children and their flocks and herds were left in Goshen.  "
"1516","Genesis","50","9","Chariots and horsemen  also went up with him. It was a very large company. "
"1517","Genesis","50","10","When they reached the threshing floor of Atad, near the Jordan, they lamented loudly and bitterly; and there Joseph observed a seven-day period of mourning for his father.  "
"1518","Genesis","50","11","When the Canaanites who lived there saw the mourning at the threshing floor of Atad, they said, “The Egyptians are holding a solemn ceremony of mourning.” That is why that place near the Jordan is called Abel Mizraim. "
"1519","Genesis","50","12","So Jacob’s sons did as he had commanded them:  "
"1520","Genesis","50","13","They carried him to the land of Canaan and buried him in the cave in the field of Machpelah, near Mamre, which Abraham had bought along with the field as a burial place from Ephron the Hittite.  "
"1521","Genesis","50","14","After burying his father, Joseph returned to Egypt, together with his brothers and all the others who had gone with him to bury his father. "
"1522","Genesis","50","15","When Joseph’s brothers saw that their father was dead, they said, “What if Joseph holds a grudge against us and pays us back for all the wrongs we did to him?”  "
"1523","Genesis","50","16","So they sent word to Joseph, saying, “Your father left these instructions before he died:  "
"1524","Genesis","50","17","‘This is what you are to say to Joseph: I ask you to forgive your brothers the sins and the wrongs they committed in treating you so badly.’ Now please forgive the sins of the servants of the God of your father.” When their message came to him, Joseph wept. "
"1525","Genesis","50","18","His brothers then came and threw themselves down before him. “We are your slaves,” they said. "
"1526","Genesis","50","19","But Joseph said to them, “Don’t be afraid. Am I in the place of God?  "
"1527","Genesis","50","20","You intended to harm me, but God intended it for good to accomplish what is now being done, the saving of many lives.  "
"1528","Genesis","50","21","So then, don’t be afraid. I will provide for you and your children.” And he reassured them and spoke kindly to them. "
"1529","Genesis","50","22","Joseph stayed in Egypt, along with all his father’s family. He lived a hundred and ten years  "
"1530","Genesis","50","23","and saw the third generation of Ephraim’s children. Also the children of Makir son of Manasseh were placed at birth on Joseph’s knees. "
"1531","Genesis","50","24","Then Joseph said to his brothers, “I am about to die. But God will surely come to your aid and take you up out of this land to the land he promised on oath to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.”  "
"1532","Genesis","50","25","And Joseph made the Israelites swear an oath and said, “God will surely come to your aid, and then you must carry my bones up from this place.” "
"1533","Genesis","50","26","So Joseph died at the age of a hundred and ten. And after they embalmed him, he was placed in a coffin in Egypt."
"1534","Exodus","1","1","These are the names of the sons of Israel who went to Egypt with Jacob, each with his family:  "
"1535","Exodus","1","2","Reuben, Simeon, Levi and Judah;  "
"1536","Exodus","1","3","Issachar, Zebulun and Benjamin;  "
"1537","Exodus","1","4","Dan and Naphtali; Gad and Asher.  "
"1538","Exodus","1","5","The descendants of Jacob numbered seventy  in all; Joseph was already in Egypt. "
"1539","Exodus","1","6","Now Joseph and all his brothers and all that generation died,  "
"1540","Exodus","1","7","but the Israelites were exceedingly fruitful; they multiplied greatly, increased in numbers and became so numerous that the land was filled with them. "
"1541","Exodus","1","8","Then a new king, to whom Joseph meant nothing, came to power in Egypt.  "
"1542","Exodus","1","9","“Look,” he said to his people, “the Israelites have become far too numerous for us.  "
"1543","Exodus","1","10","Come, we must deal shrewdly with them or they will become even more numerous and, if war breaks out, will join our enemies, fight against us and leave the country.” "
"1544","Exodus","1","11","So they put slave masters over them to oppress them with forced labor, and they built Pithom and Rameses as store cities for Pharaoh.  "
"1545","Exodus","1","12","But the more they were oppressed, the more they multiplied and spread; so the Egyptians came to dread the Israelites  "
"1546","Exodus","1","13","and worked them ruthlessly.  "
"1547","Exodus","1","14","They made their lives bitter with harsh labor in brick and mortar and with all kinds of work in the fields; in all their harsh labor the Egyptians worked them ruthlessly. "
"1548","Exodus","1","15","The king of Egypt said to the Hebrew midwives, whose names were Shiphrah and Puah,  "
"1549","Exodus","1","16","“When you are helping the Hebrew women during childbirth on the delivery stool, if you see that the baby is a boy, kill him; but if it is a girl, let her live.”  "
"1550","Exodus","1","17","The midwives, however, feared God and did not do what the king of Egypt had told them to do; they let the boys live.  "
"1551","Exodus","1","18","Then the king of Egypt summoned the midwives and asked them, “Why have you done this? Why have you let the boys live?” "
"1552","Exodus","1","19","The midwives answered Pharaoh, “Hebrew women are not like Egyptian women; they are vigorous and give birth before the midwives arrive.” "
"1553","Exodus","1","20","So God was kind to the midwives and the people increased and became even more numerous.  "
"1554","Exodus","1","21","And because the midwives feared God, he gave them families of their own. "
"1555","Exodus","1","22","Then Pharaoh gave this order to all his people: “Every Hebrew boy that is born you must throw into the Nile, but let every girl live.”"
"1556","Exodus","2","1","Now a man of the tribe of Levi married a Levite woman,  "
"1557","Exodus","2","2","and she became pregnant and gave birth to a son. When she saw that he was a fine child, she hid him for three months.  "
"1558","Exodus","2","3","But when she could hide him no longer, she got a papyrus basket  for him and coated it with tar and pitch. Then she placed the child in it and put it among the reeds along the bank of the Nile.  "
"1559","Exodus","2","4","His sister stood at a distance to see what would happen to him. "
"1560","Exodus","2","5","Then Pharaoh’s daughter went down to the Nile to bathe, and her attendants were walking along the riverbank. She saw the basket among the reeds and sent her female slave to get it.  "
"1561","Exodus","2","6","She opened it and saw the baby. He was crying, and she felt sorry for him. “This is one of the Hebrew babies,” she said. "
"1562","Exodus","2","7","Then his sister asked Pharaoh’s daughter, “Shall I go and get one of the Hebrew women to nurse the baby for you?” "
"1563","Exodus","2","8","“Yes, go,” she answered. So the girl went and got the baby’s mother.  "
"1564","Exodus","2","9","Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, “Take this baby and nurse him for me, and I will pay you.” So the woman took the baby and nursed him.  "
"1565","Exodus","2","10","When the child grew older, she took him to Pharaoh’s daughter and he became her son. She named him Moses,  saying, “I drew him out of the water.” "
"1566","Exodus","2","11","One day, after Moses had grown up, he went out to where his own people were and watched them at their hard labor. He saw an Egyptian beating a Hebrew, one of his own people.  "
"1567","Exodus","2","12","Looking this way and that and seeing no one, he killed the Egyptian and hid him in the sand.  "
"1568","Exodus","2","13","The next day he went out and saw two Hebrews fighting. He asked the one in the wrong, “Why are you hitting your fellow Hebrew?” "
"1569","Exodus","2","14","The man said, “Who made you ruler and judge over us? Are you thinking of killing me as you killed the Egyptian?” Then Moses was afraid and thought, “What I did must have become known.” "
"1570","Exodus","2","15","When Pharaoh heard of this, he tried to kill Moses, but Moses fled from Pharaoh and went to live in Midian, where he sat down by a well.  "
"1571","Exodus","2","16","Now a priest of Midian had seven daughters, and they came to draw water and fill the troughs to water their father’s flock.  "
"1572","Exodus","2","17","Some shepherds came along and drove them away, but Moses got up and came to their rescue and watered their flock. "
"1573","Exodus","2","18","When the girls returned to Reuel their father, he asked them, “Why have you returned so early today?” "
"1574","Exodus","2","19","They answered, “An Egyptian rescued us from the shepherds. He even drew water for us and watered the flock.” "
"1575","Exodus","2","20","“And where is he?” Reuel asked his daughters. “Why did you leave him? Invite him to have something to eat.” "
"1576","Exodus","2","21","Moses agreed to stay with the man, who gave his daughter Zipporah to Moses in marriage.  "
"1577","Exodus","2","22","Zipporah gave birth to a son, and Moses named him Gershom,  saying, “I have become a foreigner in a foreign land.” "
"1578","Exodus","2","23","During that long period, the king of Egypt died. The Israelites groaned in their slavery and cried out, and their cry for help because of their slavery went up to God.  "
"1579","Exodus","2","24","God heard their groaning and he remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac and with Jacob.  "
"1580","Exodus","2","25","So God looked on the Israelites and was concerned about them."
"1581","Exodus","3","1","Now Moses was tending the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the priest of Midian, and he led the flock to the far side of the wilderness and came to Horeb, the mountain of God.  "
"1582","Exodus","3","2","There the angel of the  Lord  appeared to him in flames of fire from within a bush. Moses saw that though the bush was on fire it did not burn up.  "
"1583","Exodus","3","3","So Moses thought, “I will go over and see this strange sight—why the bush does not burn up.” "
"1584","Exodus","3","4","When the  Lord  saw that he had gone over to look, God called to him from within the bush, “Moses! Moses!” And Moses said, “Here I am.” "
"1585","Exodus","3","5","“Do not come any closer,” God said. “Take off your sandals, for the place where you are standing is holy ground.”  "
"1586","Exodus","3","6","Then he said, “I am the God of your father,  the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob.” At this, Moses hid his face, because he was afraid to look at God. "
"1587","Exodus","3","7","The  Lord  said, “I have indeed seen the misery of my people in Egypt. I have heard them crying out because of their slave drivers, and I am concerned about their suffering.  "
"1588","Exodus","3","8","So I have come down to rescue them from the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land into a good and spacious land, a land flowing with milk and honey—the home of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites.  "
"1589","Exodus","3","9","And now the cry of the Israelites has reached me, and I have seen the way the Egyptians are oppressing them.  "
"1590","Exodus","3","10","So now, go. I am sending you to Pharaoh to bring my people the Israelites out of Egypt.” "
"1591","Exodus","3","11","But Moses said to God, “Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh and bring the Israelites out of Egypt?” "
"1592","Exodus","3","12","And God said, “I will be with you. And this will be the sign to you that it is I who have sent you: When you have brought the people out of Egypt, you  will worship God on this mountain.” "
"1593","Exodus","3","13","Moses said to God, “Suppose I go to the Israelites and say to them, ‘The God of your fathers has sent me to you,’ and they ask me, ‘What is his name?’ Then what shall I tell them?” "
"1594","Exodus","3","14","God said to Moses, “ I am who I am .  This is what you are to say to the Israelites: ‘ I am  has sent me to you.’ ” "
"1595","Exodus","3","15","God also said to Moses, “Say to the Israelites, ‘The  Lord ,  the God of your fathers—the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob—has sent me to you.’ “This is my name forever, the name you shall call me from generation to generation. "
"1596","Exodus","3","16","“Go, assemble the elders of Israel and say to them, ‘The  Lord , the God of your fathers—the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob—appeared to me and said: I have watched over you and have seen what has been done to you in Egypt.  "
"1597","Exodus","3","17","And I have promised to bring you up out of your misery in Egypt into the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites—a land flowing with milk and honey.’ "
"1598","Exodus","3","18","“The elders of Israel will listen to you. Then you and the elders are to go to the king of Egypt and say to him, ‘The  Lord , the God of the Hebrews, has met with us. Let us take a three-day journey into the wilderness to offer sacrifices to the  Lord  our God.’  "
"1599","Exodus","3","19","But I know that the king of Egypt will not let you go unless a mighty hand compels him.  "
"1600","Exodus","3","20","So I will stretch out my hand and strike the Egyptians with all the wonders that I will perform among them. After that, he will let you go. "
"1601","Exodus","3","21","“And I will make the Egyptians favorably disposed toward this people, so that when you leave you will not go empty-handed.  "
"1602","Exodus","3","22","Every woman is to ask her neighbor and any woman living in her house for articles of silver and gold and for clothing, which you will put on your sons and daughters. And so you will plunder the Egyptians.”"
"1603","Exodus","4","1","Moses answered, “What if they do not believe me or listen to me and say, ‘The  Lord  did not appear to you’?” "
"1604","Exodus","4","2","Then the  Lord  said to him, “What is that in your hand?” “A staff,” he replied. "
"1605","Exodus","4","3","The  Lord  said, “Throw it on the ground.” Moses threw it on the ground and it became a snake, and he ran from it.  "
"1606","Exodus","4","4","Then the  Lord  said to him, “Reach out your hand and take it by the tail.” So Moses reached out and took hold of the snake and it turned back into a staff in his hand.  "
"1607","Exodus","4","5","“This,” said the  Lord , “is so that they may believe that the  Lord , the God of their fathers—the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob—has appeared to you.” "
"1608","Exodus","4","6","Then the  Lord  said, “Put your hand inside your cloak.” So Moses put his hand into his cloak, and when he took it out, the skin was leprous —it had become as white as snow. "
"1609","Exodus","4","7","“Now put it back into your cloak,” he said. So Moses put his hand back into his cloak, and when he took it out, it was restored, like the rest of his flesh. "
"1610","Exodus","4","8","Then the  Lord  said, “If they do not believe you or pay attention to the first sign, they may believe the second.  "
"1611","Exodus","4","9","But if they do not believe these two signs or listen to you, take some water from the Nile and pour it on the dry ground. The water you take from the river will become blood on the ground.” "
"1612","Exodus","4","10","Moses said to the  Lord , “Pardon your servant, Lord. I have never been eloquent, neither in the past nor since you have spoken to your servant. I am slow of speech and tongue.” "
"1613","Exodus","4","11","The  Lord  said to him, “Who gave human beings their mouths? Who makes them deaf or mute? Who gives them sight or makes them blind? Is it not I, the  Lord ?  "
"1614","Exodus","4","12","Now go; I will help you speak and will teach you what to say.” "
"1615","Exodus","4","13","But Moses said, “Pardon your servant, Lord. Please send someone else.” "
"1616","Exodus","4","14","Then the  Lord ’s anger burned against Moses and he said, “What about your brother, Aaron the Levite? I know he can speak well. He is already on his way to meet you, and he will be glad to see you.  "
"1617","Exodus","4","15","You shall speak to him and put words in his mouth; I will help both of you speak and will teach you what to do.  "
"1618","Exodus","4","16","He will speak to the people for you, and it will be as if he were your mouth and as if you were God to him.  "
"1619","Exodus","4","17","But take this staff in your hand so you can perform the signs with it.” "
"1620","Exodus","4","18","Then Moses went back to Jethro his father-in-law and said to him, “Let me return to my own people in Egypt to see if any of them are still alive.” Jethro said, “Go, and I wish you well.” "
"1621","Exodus","4","19","Now the  Lord  had said to Moses in Midian, “Go back to Egypt, for all those who wanted to kill you are dead.”  "
"1622","Exodus","4","20","So Moses took his wife and sons, put them on a donkey and started back to Egypt. And he took the staff of God in his hand. "
"1623","Exodus","4","21","The  Lord  said to Moses, “When you return to Egypt, see that you perform before Pharaoh all the wonders I have given you the power to do. But I will harden his heart so that he will not let the people go.  "
"1624","Exodus","4","22","Then say to Pharaoh, ‘This is what the  Lord  says: Israel is my firstborn son,  "
"1625","Exodus","4","23","and I told you, “Let my son go, so he may worship me.” But you refused to let him go; so I will kill your firstborn son.’ ” "
"1626","Exodus","4","24","At a lodging place on the way, the  Lord  met Moses  and was about to kill him.  "
"1627","Exodus","4","25","But Zipporah took a flint knife, cut off her son’s foreskin and touched Moses’ feet with it.  “Surely you are a bridegroom of blood to me,” she said.  "
"1628","Exodus","4","26","So the  Lord  let him alone. (At that time she said “bridegroom of blood,” referring to circumcision.) "
"1629","Exodus","4","27","The  Lord  said to Aaron, “Go into the wilderness to meet Moses.” So he met Moses at the mountain of God and kissed him.  "
"1630","Exodus","4","28","Then Moses told Aaron everything the  Lord  had sent him to say, and also about all the signs he had commanded him to perform. "
"1631","Exodus","4","29","Moses and Aaron brought together all the elders of the Israelites,  "
"1632","Exodus","4","30","and Aaron told them everything the  Lord  had said to Moses. He also performed the signs before the people,  "
"1633","Exodus","4","31","and they believed. And when they heard that the  Lord  was concerned about them and had seen their misery, they bowed down and worshiped."
"1634","Exodus","5","1","Afterward Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and said, “This is what the  Lord , the God of Israel, says: ‘Let my people go, so that they may hold a festival to me in the wilderness.’ ” "
"1635","Exodus","5","2","Pharaoh said, “Who is the  Lord , that I should obey him and let Israel go? I do not know the  Lord  and I will not let Israel go.” "
"1636","Exodus","5","3","Then they said, “The God of the Hebrews has met with us. Now let us take a three-day journey into the wilderness to offer sacrifices to the  Lord  our God, or he may strike us with plagues or with the sword.” "
"1637","Exodus","5","4","But the king of Egypt said, “Moses and Aaron, why are you taking the people away from their labor? Get back to your work!”  "
"1638","Exodus","5","5","Then Pharaoh said, “Look, the people of the land are now numerous, and you are stopping them from working.” "
"1639","Exodus","5","6","That same day Pharaoh gave this order to the slave drivers and overseers in charge of the people:  "
"1640","Exodus","5","7","“You are no longer to supply the people with straw for making bricks; let them go and gather their own straw.  "
"1641","Exodus","5","8","But require them to make the same number of bricks as before; don’t reduce the quota. They are lazy; that is why they are crying out, ‘Let us go and sacrifice to our God.’  "
"1642","Exodus","5","9","Make the work harder for the people so that they keep working and pay no attention to lies.” "
"1643","Exodus","5","10","Then the slave drivers and the overseers went out and said to the people, “This is what Pharaoh says: ‘I will not give you any more straw.  "
"1644","Exodus","5","11","Go and get your own straw wherever you can find it, but your work will not be reduced at all.’ ”  "
"1645","Exodus","5","12","So the people scattered all over Egypt to gather stubble to use for straw.  "
"1646","Exodus","5","13","The slave drivers kept pressing them, saying, “Complete the work required of you for each day, just as when you had straw.”  "
"1647","Exodus","5","14","And Pharaoh’s slave drivers beat the Israelite overseers they had appointed, demanding, “Why haven’t you met your quota of bricks yesterday or today, as before?” "
"1648","Exodus","5","15","Then the Israelite overseers went and appealed to Pharaoh: “Why have you treated your servants this way?  "
"1649","Exodus","5","16","Your servants are given no straw, yet we are told, ‘Make bricks!’ Your servants are being beaten, but the fault is with your own people.” "
"1650","Exodus","5","17","Pharaoh said, “Lazy, that’s what you are—lazy! That is why you keep saying, ‘Let us go and sacrifice to the  Lord .’  "
"1651","Exodus","5","18","Now get to work. You will not be given any straw, yet you must produce your full quota of bricks.” "
"1652","Exodus","5","19","The Israelite overseers realized they were in trouble when they were told, “You are not to reduce the number of bricks required of you for each day.”  "
"1653","Exodus","5","20","When they left Pharaoh, they found Moses and Aaron waiting to meet them,  "
"1654","Exodus","5","21","and they said, “May the  Lord  look on you and judge you! You have made us obnoxious to Pharaoh and his officials and have put a sword in their hand to kill us.” "
"1655","Exodus","5","22","Moses returned to the  Lord  and said, “Why, Lord, why have you brought trouble on this people? Is this why you sent me?  "
"1656","Exodus","5","23","Ever since I went to Pharaoh to speak in your name, he has brought trouble on this people, and you have not rescued your people at all.”"
"1657","Exodus","6","1","Then the  Lord  said to Moses, “Now you will see what I will do to Pharaoh: Because of my mighty hand he will let them go; because of my mighty hand he will drive them out of his country.” "
"1658","Exodus","6","2","God also said to Moses, “I am the  Lord .  "
"1659","Exodus","6","3","I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac and to Jacob as God Almighty,  but by my name the  Lord  I did not make myself fully known to them.  "
"1660","Exodus","6","4","I also established my covenant with them to give them the land of Canaan, where they resided as foreigners.  "
"1661","Exodus","6","5","Moreover, I have heard the groaning of the Israelites, whom the Egyptians are enslaving, and I have remembered my covenant. "
"1662","Exodus","6","6","“Therefore, say to the Israelites: ‘I am the  Lord , and I will bring you out from under the yoke of the Egyptians. I will free you from being slaves to them, and I will redeem you with an outstretched arm and with mighty acts of judgment.  "
"1663","Exodus","6","7","I will take you as my own people, and I will be your God. Then you will know that I am the  Lord  your God, who brought you out from under the yoke of the Egyptians.  "
"1664","Exodus","6","8","And I will bring you to the land I swore with uplifted hand to give to Abraham, to Isaac and to Jacob. I will give it to you as a possession. I am the  Lord .’ ” "
"1665","Exodus","6","9","Moses reported this to the Israelites, but they did not listen to him because of their discouragement and harsh labor. "
"1666","Exodus","6","10","Then the  Lord  said to Moses,  "
"1667","Exodus","6","11","“Go, tell Pharaoh king of Egypt to let the Israelites go out of his country.” "
"1668","Exodus","6","12","But Moses said to the  Lord , “If the Israelites will not listen to me, why would Pharaoh listen to me, since I speak with faltering lips ?” "
"1669","Exodus","6","13","Now the  Lord  spoke to Moses and Aaron about the Israelites and Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he commanded them to bring the Israelites out of Egypt. "
"1670","Exodus","6","14","These were the heads of their families : "
"1671","Exodus","6","15","The sons of Simeon were Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jakin, Zohar and Shaul the son of a Canaanite woman. These were the clans of Simeon."
"1672","Exodus","6","16","These were the names of the sons of Levi according to their records: Gershon, Kohath and Merari. Levi lived 137 years."
"1673","Exodus","6","17","The sons of Gershon, by clans, were Libni and Shimei."
"1674","Exodus","6","18","The sons of Kohath were Amram, Izhar, Hebron and Uzziel. Kohath lived 133 years."
"1675","Exodus","6","19","The sons of Merari were Mahli and Mushi.These were the clans of Levi according to their records."
"1676","Exodus","6","20","Amram married his father’s sister Jochebed, who bore him Aaron and Moses. Amram lived 137 years."
"1677","Exodus","6","21","The sons of Izhar were Korah, Nepheg and Zikri."
"1678","Exodus","6","22","The sons of Uzziel were Mishael, Elzaphan and Sithri."
"1679","Exodus","6","23","Aaron married Elisheba, daughter of Amminadab and sister of Nahshon, and she bore him Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar."
"1680","Exodus","6","24","The sons of Korah were: Assir, Elkanah and Abiasaph. These were the Korahite clans."
"1681","Exodus","6","25","Eleazar son of Aaron married one of the daughters of Putiel, and she bore him Phinehas.These were the heads of the Levite families, clan by clan."
"1682","Exodus","6","26","It was this Aaron and Moses to whom the  Lord  said, “Bring the Israelites out of Egypt by their divisions.”  "
"1683","Exodus","6","27","They were the ones who spoke to Pharaoh king of Egypt about bringing the Israelites out of Egypt—this same Moses and Aaron. "
"1684","Exodus","6","28","Now when the  Lord  spoke to Moses in Egypt,  "
"1685","Exodus","6","29","he said to him, “I am the  Lord . Tell Pharaoh king of Egypt everything I tell you.” "
"1686","Exodus","6","30","But Moses said to the  Lord , “Since I speak with faltering lips, why would Pharaoh listen to me?”"
"1687","Exodus","7","1","Then the  Lord  said to Moses, “See, I have made you like God to Pharaoh, and your brother Aaron will be your prophet.  "
"1688","Exodus","7","2","You are to say everything I command you, and your brother Aaron is to tell Pharaoh to let the Israelites go out of his country.  "
"1689","Exodus","7","3","But I will harden Pharaoh’s heart, and though I multiply my signs and wonders in Egypt,  "
"1690","Exodus","7","4","he will not listen to you. Then I will lay my hand on Egypt and with mighty acts of judgment I will bring out my divisions, my people the Israelites.  "
"1691","Exodus","7","5","And the Egyptians will know that I am the  Lord  when I stretch out my hand against Egypt and bring the Israelites out of it.” "
"1692","Exodus","7","6","Moses and Aaron did just as the  Lord  commanded them.  "
"1693","Exodus","7","7","Moses was eighty years old and Aaron eighty-three when they spoke to Pharaoh. "
"1694","Exodus","7","8","The  Lord  said to Moses and Aaron,  "
"1695","Exodus","7","9","“When Pharaoh says to you, ‘Perform a miracle,’ then say to Aaron, ‘Take your staff and throw it down before Pharaoh,’ and it will become a snake.” "
"1696","Exodus","7","10","So Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and did just as the  Lord  commanded. Aaron threw his staff down in front of Pharaoh and his officials, and it became a snake.  "
"1697","Exodus","7","11","Pharaoh then summoned wise men and sorcerers, and the Egyptian magicians also did the same things by their secret arts:  "
"1698","Exodus","7","12","Each one threw down his staff and it became a snake. But Aaron’s staff swallowed up their staffs.  "
"1699","Exodus","7","13","Yet Pharaoh’s heart became hard and he would not listen to them, just as the  Lord  had said. "
"1700","Exodus","7","14","Then the  Lord  said to Moses, “Pharaoh’s heart is unyielding; he refuses to let the people go.  "
"1701","Exodus","7","15","Go to Pharaoh in the morning as he goes out to the river. Confront him on the bank of the Nile, and take in your hand the staff that was changed into a snake.  "
"1702","Exodus","7","16","Then say to him, ‘The  Lord , the God of the Hebrews, has sent me to say to you: Let my people go, so that they may worship me in the wilderness. But until now you have not listened.  "
"1703","Exodus","7","17","This is what the  Lord  says: By this you will know that I am the  Lord : With the staff that is in my hand I will strike the water of the Nile, and it will be changed into blood.  "
"1704","Exodus","7","18","The fish in the Nile will die, and the river will stink; the Egyptians will not be able to drink its water.’ ” "
"1705","Exodus","7","19","The  Lord  said to Moses, “Tell Aaron, ‘Take your staff and stretch out your hand over the waters of Egypt—over the streams and canals, over the ponds and all the reservoirs—and they will turn to blood.’ Blood will be everywhere in Egypt, even in vessels  of wood and stone.” "
"1706","Exodus","7","20","Moses and Aaron did just as the  Lord  had commanded. He raised his staff in the presence of Pharaoh and his officials and struck the water of the Nile, and all the water was changed into blood.  "
"1707","Exodus","7","21","The fish in the Nile died, and the river smelled so bad that the Egyptians could not drink its water. Blood was everywhere in Egypt. "
"1708","Exodus","7","22","But the Egyptian magicians did the same things by their secret arts, and Pharaoh’s heart became hard; he would not listen to Moses and Aaron, just as the  Lord  had said.  "
"1709","Exodus","7","23","Instead, he turned and went into his palace, and did not take even this to heart.  "
"1710","Exodus","7","24","And all the Egyptians dug along the Nile to get drinking water, because they could not drink the water of the river. "
"1711","Exodus","7","25","Seven days passed after the  Lord  struck the Nile."
"1712","Exodus","8","1","Then the  Lord  said to Moses, “Go to Pharaoh and say to him, ‘This is what the  Lord  says: Let my people go, so that they may worship me.  "
"1713","Exodus","8","2","If you refuse to let them go, I will send a plague of frogs on your whole country.  "
"1714","Exodus","8","3","The Nile will teem with frogs. They will come up into your palace and your bedroom and onto your bed, into the houses of your officials and on your people, and into your ovens and kneading troughs.  "
"1715","Exodus","8","4","The frogs will come up on you and your people and all your officials.’ ” "
"1716","Exodus","8","5","Then the  Lord  said to Moses, “Tell Aaron, ‘Stretch out your hand with your staff over the streams and canals and ponds, and make frogs come up on the land of Egypt.’ ” "
"1717","Exodus","8","6","So Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt, and the frogs came up and covered the land.  "
"1718","Exodus","8","7","But the magicians did the same things by their secret arts; they also made frogs come up on the land of Egypt. "
"1719","Exodus","8","8","Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron and said, “Pray to the  Lord  to take the frogs away from me and my people, and I will let your people go to offer sacrifices to the  Lord .” "
"1720","Exodus","8","9","Moses said to Pharaoh, “I leave to you the honor of setting the time for me to pray for you and your officials and your people that you and your houses may be rid of the frogs, except for those that remain in the Nile.” "
"1721","Exodus","8","10","“Tomorrow,” Pharaoh said. Moses replied, “It will be as you say, so that you may know there is no one like the  Lord  our God.  "
"1722","Exodus","8","11","The frogs will leave you and your houses, your officials and your people; they will remain only in the Nile.” "
"1723","Exodus","8","12","After Moses and Aaron left Pharaoh, Moses cried out to the  Lord  about the frogs he had brought on Pharaoh.  "
"1724","Exodus","8","13","And the  Lord  did what Moses asked. The frogs died in the houses, in the courtyards and in the fields.  "
"1725","Exodus","8","14","They were piled into heaps, and the land reeked of them.  "
"1726","Exodus","8","15","But when Pharaoh saw that there was relief, he hardened his heart and would not listen to Moses and Aaron, just as the  Lord  had said. "
"1727","Exodus","8","16","Then the  Lord  said to Moses, “Tell Aaron, ‘Stretch out your staff and strike the dust of the ground,’ and throughout the land of Egypt the dust will become gnats.”  "
"1728","Exodus","8","17","They did this, and when Aaron stretched out his hand with the staff and struck the dust of the ground, gnats came on people and animals. All the dust throughout the land of Egypt became gnats.  "
"1729","Exodus","8","18","But when the magicians tried to produce gnats by their secret arts, they could not. Since the gnats were on people and animals everywhere,  "
"1730","Exodus","8","19","the magicians said to Pharaoh, “This is the finger of God.” But Pharaoh’s heart was hard and he would not listen, just as the  Lord  had said. "
"1731","Exodus","8","20","Then the  Lord  said to Moses, “Get up early in the morning and confront Pharaoh as he goes to the river and say to him, ‘This is what the  Lord  says: Let my people go, so that they may worship me.  "
"1732","Exodus","8","21","If you do not let my people go, I will send swarms of flies on you and your officials, on your people and into your houses. The houses of the Egyptians will be full of flies; even the ground will be covered with them. "
"1733","Exodus","8","22","“ ‘But on that day I will deal differently with the land of Goshen, where my people live; no swarms of flies will be there, so that you will know that I, the  Lord , am in this land.  "
"1734","Exodus","8","23","I will make a distinction  between my people and your people. This sign will occur tomorrow.’ ” "
"1735","Exodus","8","24","And the  Lord  did this. Dense swarms of flies poured into Pharaoh’s palace and into the houses of his officials; throughout Egypt the land was ruined by the flies. "
"1736","Exodus","8","25","Then Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron and said, “Go, sacrifice to your God here in the land.” "
"1737","Exodus","8","26","But Moses said, “That would not be right. The sacrifices we offer the  Lord  our God would be detestable to the Egyptians. And if we offer sacrifices that are detestable in their eyes, will they not stone us?  "
"1738","Exodus","8","27","We must take a three-day journey into the wilderness to offer sacrifices to the  Lord  our God, as he commands us.” "
"1739","Exodus","8","28","Pharaoh said, “I will let you go to offer sacrifices to the  Lord  your God in the wilderness, but you must not go very far. Now pray for me.” "
"1740","Exodus","8","29","Moses answered, “As soon as I leave you, I will pray to the  Lord , and tomorrow the flies will leave Pharaoh and his officials and his people. Only let Pharaoh be sure that he does not act deceitfully again by not letting the people go to offer sacrifices to the  Lord .” "
"1741","Exodus","8","30","Then Moses left Pharaoh and prayed to the  Lord ,  "
"1742","Exodus","8","31","and the  Lord  did what Moses asked. The flies left Pharaoh and his officials and his people; not a fly remained.  "
"1743","Exodus","8","32","But this time also Pharaoh hardened his heart and would not let the people go."
"1744","Exodus","9","1","Then the  Lord  said to Moses, “Go to Pharaoh and say to him, ‘This is what the  Lord , the God of the Hebrews, says: “Let my people go, so that they may worship me.”  "
"1745","Exodus","9","2","If you refuse to let them go and continue to hold them back,  "
"1746","Exodus","9","3","the hand of the  Lord  will bring a terrible plague on your livestock in the field—on your horses, donkeys and camels and on your cattle, sheep and goats.  "
"1747","Exodus","9","4","But the  Lord  will make a distinction between the livestock of Israel and that of Egypt, so that no animal belonging to the Israelites will die.’ ” "
"1748","Exodus","9","5","The  Lord  set a time and said, “Tomorrow the  Lord  will do this in the land.”  "
"1749","Exodus","9","6","And the next day the  Lord  did it: All the livestock of the Egyptians died, but not one animal belonging to the Israelites died.  "
"1750","Exodus","9","7","Pharaoh investigated and found that not even one of the animals of the Israelites had died. Yet his heart was unyielding and he would not let the people go. "
"1751","Exodus","9","8","Then the  Lord  said to Moses and Aaron, “Take handfuls of soot from a furnace and have Moses toss it into the air in the presence of Pharaoh.  "
"1752","Exodus","9","9","It will become fine dust over the whole land of Egypt, and festering boils will break out on people and animals throughout the land.” "
"1753","Exodus","9","10","So they took soot from a furnace and stood before Pharaoh. Moses tossed it into the air, and festering boils broke out on people and animals.  "
"1754","Exodus","9","11","The magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils that were on them and on all the Egyptians.  "
"1755","Exodus","9","12","But the  Lord  hardened Pharaoh’s heart and he would not listen to Moses and Aaron, just as the  Lord  had said to Moses. "
"1756","Exodus","9","13","Then the  Lord  said to Moses, “Get up early in the morning, confront Pharaoh and say to him, ‘This is what the  Lord , the God of the Hebrews, says: Let my people go, so that they may worship me,  "
"1757","Exodus","9","14","or this time I will send the full force of my plagues against you and against your officials and your people, so you may know that there is no one like me in all the earth.  "
"1758","Exodus","9","15","For by now I could have stretched out my hand and struck you and your people with a plague that would have wiped you off the earth.  "
"1759","Exodus","9","16","But I have raised you up  for this very purpose, that I might show you my power and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth.  "
"1760","Exodus","9","17","You still set yourself against my people and will not let them go.  "
"1761","Exodus","9","18","Therefore, at this time tomorrow I will send the worst hailstorm that has ever fallen on Egypt, from the day it was founded till now.  "
"1762","Exodus","9","19","Give an order now to bring your livestock and everything you have in the field to a place of shelter, because the hail will fall on every person and animal that has not been brought in and is still out in the field, and they will die.’ ” "
"1763","Exodus","9","20","Those officials of Pharaoh who feared the word of the  Lord  hurried to bring their slaves and their livestock inside.  "
"1764","Exodus","9","21","But those who ignored the word of the  Lord  left their slaves and livestock in the field. "
"1765","Exodus","9","22","Then the  Lord  said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand toward the sky so that hail will fall all over Egypt—on people and animals and on everything growing in the fields of Egypt.”  "
"1766","Exodus","9","23","When Moses stretched out his staff toward the sky, the  Lord  sent thunder and hail, and lightning flashed down to the ground. So the  Lord  rained hail on the land of Egypt;  "
"1767","Exodus","9","24","hail fell and lightning flashed back and forth. It was the worst storm in all the land of Egypt since it had become a nation.  "
"1768","Exodus","9","25","Throughout Egypt hail struck everything in the fields—both people and animals; it beat down everything growing in the fields and stripped every tree.  "
"1769","Exodus","9","26","The only place it did not hail was the land of Goshen, where the Israelites were. "
"1770","Exodus","9","27","Then Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron. “This time I have sinned,” he said to them. “The  Lord  is in the right, and I and my people are in the wrong.  "
"1771","Exodus","9","28","Pray to the  Lord , for we have had enough thunder and hail. I will let you go; you don’t have to stay any longer.” "
"1772","Exodus","9","29","Moses replied, “When I have gone out of the city, I will spread out my hands in prayer to the  Lord . The thunder will stop and there will be no more hail, so you may know that the earth is the  Lord ’s.  "
"1773","Exodus","9","30","But I know that you and your officials still do not fear the  Lord  God.” "
"1774","Exodus","9","31","(The flax and barley were destroyed, since the barley had headed and the flax was in bloom.  "
"1775","Exodus","9","32","The wheat and spelt, however, were not destroyed, because they ripen later.) "
"1776","Exodus","9","33","Then Moses left Pharaoh and went out of the city. He spread out his hands toward the  Lord ; the thunder and hail stopped, and the rain no longer poured down on the land.  "
"1777","Exodus","9","34","When Pharaoh saw that the rain and hail and thunder had stopped, he sinned again: He and his officials hardened their hearts.  "
"1778","Exodus","9","35","So Pharaoh’s heart was hard and he would not let the Israelites go, just as the  Lord  had said through Moses."
"1779","Exodus","10","1","Then the  Lord  said to Moses, “Go to Pharaoh, for I have hardened his heart and the hearts of his officials so that I may perform these signs of mine among them  "
"1780","Exodus","10","2","that you may tell your children and grandchildren how I dealt harshly with the Egyptians and how I performed my signs among them, and that you may know that I am the  Lord .” "
"1781","Exodus","10","3","So Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and said to him, “This is what the  Lord , the God of the Hebrews, says: ‘How long will you refuse to humble yourself before me? Let my people go, so that they may worship me.  "
"1782","Exodus","10","4","If you refuse to let them go, I will bring locusts into your country tomorrow.  "
"1783","Exodus","10","5","They will cover the face of the ground so that it cannot be seen. They will devour what little you have left after the hail, including every tree that is growing in your fields.  "
"1784","Exodus","10","6","They will fill your houses and those of all your officials and all the Egyptians—something neither your parents nor your ancestors have ever seen from the day they settled in this land till now.’ ” Then Moses turned and left Pharaoh. "
"1785","Exodus","10","7","Pharaoh’s officials said to him, “How long will this man be a snare to us? Let the people go, so that they may worship the  Lord  their God. Do you not yet realize that Egypt is ruined?” "
"1786","Exodus","10","8","Then Moses and Aaron were brought back to Pharaoh. “Go, worship the  Lord  your God,” he said. “But tell me who will be going.” "
"1787","Exodus","10","9","Moses answered, “We will go with our young and our old, with our sons and our daughters, and with our flocks and herds, because we are to celebrate a festival to the  Lord .” "
"1788","Exodus","10","10","Pharaoh said, “The  Lord  be with you—if I let you go, along with your women and children! Clearly you are bent on evil.   "
"1789","Exodus","10","11","No! Have only the men go and worship the  Lord , since that’s what you have been asking for.” Then Moses and Aaron were driven out of Pharaoh’s presence. "
"1790","Exodus","10","12","And the  Lord  said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand over Egypt so that locusts swarm over the land and devour everything growing in the fields, everything left by the hail.” "
"1791","Exodus","10","13","So Moses stretched out his staff over Egypt, and the  Lord  made an east wind blow across the land all that day and all that night. By morning the wind had brought the locusts;  "
"1792","Exodus","10","14","they invaded all Egypt and settled down in every area of the country in great numbers. Never before had there been such a plague of locusts, nor will there ever be again.  "
"1793","Exodus","10","15","They covered all the ground until it was black. They devoured all that was left after the hail—everything growing in the fields and the fruit on the trees. Nothing green remained on tree or plant in all the land of Egypt. "
"1794","Exodus","10","16","Pharaoh quickly summoned Moses and Aaron and said, “I have sinned against the  Lord  your God and against you.  "
"1795","Exodus","10","17","Now forgive my sin once more and pray to the  Lord  your God to take this deadly plague away from me.” "
"1796","Exodus","10","18","Moses then left Pharaoh and prayed to the  Lord .  "
"1797","Exodus","10","19","And the  Lord  changed the wind to a very strong west wind, which caught up the locusts and carried them into the Red Sea.  Not a locust was left anywhere in Egypt.  "
"1798","Exodus","10","20","But the  Lord  hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he would not let the Israelites go. "
"1799","Exodus","10","21","Then the  Lord  said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand toward the sky so that darkness spreads over Egypt—darkness that can be felt.”  "
"1800","Exodus","10","22","So Moses stretched out his hand toward the sky, and total darkness covered all Egypt for three days.  "
"1801","Exodus","10","23","No one could see anyone else or move about for three days. Yet all the Israelites had light in the places where they lived. "
"1802","Exodus","10","24","Then Pharaoh summoned Moses and said, “Go, worship the  Lord . Even your women and children may go with you; only leave your flocks and herds behind.” "
"1803","Exodus","10","25","But Moses said, “You must allow us to have sacrifices and burnt offerings to present to the  Lord  our God.  "
"1804","Exodus","10","26","Our livestock too must go with us; not a hoof is to be left behind. We have to use some of them in worshiping the  Lord  our God, and until we get there we will not know what we are to use to worship the  Lord .” "
"1805","Exodus","10","27","But the  Lord  hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he was not willing to let them go.  "
"1806","Exodus","10","28","Pharaoh said to Moses, “Get out of my sight! Make sure you do not appear before me again! The day you see my face you will die.” "
"1807","Exodus","10","29","“Just as you say,” Moses replied. “I will never appear before you again.”"
"1808","Exodus","11","1","Now the  Lord  had said to Moses, “I will bring one more plague on Pharaoh and on Egypt. After that, he will let you go from here, and when he does, he will drive you out completely.  "
"1809","Exodus","11","2","Tell the people that men and women alike are to ask their neighbors for articles of silver and gold.”  "
"1810","Exodus","11","3","(The  Lord  made the Egyptians favorably disposed toward the people, and Moses himself was highly regarded in Egypt by Pharaoh’s officials and by the people.) "
"1811","Exodus","11","4","So Moses said, “This is what the  Lord  says: ‘About midnight I will go throughout Egypt.  "
"1812","Exodus","11","5","Every firstborn son in Egypt will die, from the firstborn son of Pharaoh, who sits on the throne, to the firstborn son of the female slave, who is at her hand mill, and all the firstborn of the cattle as well.  "
"1813","Exodus","11","6","There will be loud wailing throughout Egypt—worse than there has ever been or ever will be again.  "
"1814","Exodus","11","7","But among the Israelites not a dog will bark at any person or animal.’ Then you will know that the  Lord  makes a distinction between Egypt and Israel.  "
"1815","Exodus","11","8","All these officials of yours will come to me, bowing down before me and saying, ‘Go, you and all the people who follow you!’ After that I will leave.” Then Moses, hot with anger, left Pharaoh. "
"1816","Exodus","11","9","The  Lord  had said to Moses, “Pharaoh will refuse to listen to you—so that my wonders may be multiplied in Egypt.”  "
"1817","Exodus","11","10","Moses and Aaron performed all these wonders before Pharaoh, but the  Lord  hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he would not let the Israelites go out of his country."
"1818","Exodus","12","1","The  Lord  said to Moses and Aaron in Egypt,  "
"1819","Exodus","12","2","“This month is to be for you the first month, the first month of your year.  "
"1820","Exodus","12","3","Tell the whole community of Israel that on the tenth day of this month each man is to take a lamb  for his family, one for each household.  "
"1821","Exodus","12","4","If any household is too small for a whole lamb, they must share one with their nearest neighbor, having taken into account the number of people there are. You are to determine the amount of lamb needed in accordance with what each person will eat.  "
"1822","Exodus","12","5","The animals you choose must be year-old males without defect, and you may take them from the sheep or the goats.  "
"1823","Exodus","12","6","Take care of them until the fourteenth day of the month, when all the members of the community of Israel must slaughter them at twilight.  "
"1824","Exodus","12","7","Then they are to take some of the blood and put it on the sides and tops of the doorframes of the houses where they eat the lambs.  "
"1825","Exodus","12","8","That same night they are to eat the meat roasted over the fire, along with bitter herbs, and bread made without yeast.  "
"1826","Exodus","12","9","Do not eat the meat raw or boiled in water, but roast it over a fire—with the head, legs and internal organs.  "
"1827","Exodus","12","10","Do not leave any of it till morning; if some is left till morning, you must burn it.  "
"1828","Exodus","12","11","This is how you are to eat it: with your cloak tucked into your belt, your sandals on your feet and your staff in your hand. Eat it in haste; it is the  Lord ’s Passover. "
"1829","Exodus","12","12","“On that same night I will pass through Egypt and strike down every firstborn of both people and animals, and I will bring judgment on all the gods of Egypt. I am the  Lord .  "
"1830","Exodus","12","13","The blood will be a sign for you on the houses where you are, and when I see the blood, I will pass over you. No destructive plague will touch you when I strike Egypt. "
"1831","Exodus","12","14","“This is a day you are to commemorate; for the generations to come you shall celebrate it as a festival to the  Lord —a lasting ordinance.  "
"1832","Exodus","12","15","For seven days you are to eat bread made without yeast. On the first day remove the yeast from your houses, for whoever eats anything with yeast in it from the first day through the seventh must be cut off from Israel.  "
"1833","Exodus","12","16","On the first day hold a sacred assembly, and another one on the seventh day. Do no work at all on these days, except to prepare food for everyone to eat; that is all you may do. "
"1834","Exodus","12","17","“Celebrate the Festival of Unleavened Bread, because it was on this very day that I brought your divisions out of Egypt. Celebrate this day as a lasting ordinance for the generations to come.  "
"1835","Exodus","12","18","In the first month you are to eat bread made without yeast, from the evening of the fourteenth day until the evening of the twenty-first day.  "
"1836","Exodus","12","19","For seven days no yeast is to be found in your houses. And anyone, whether foreigner or native-born, who eats anything with yeast in it must be cut off from the community of Israel.  "
"1837","Exodus","12","20","Eat nothing made with yeast. Wherever you live, you must eat unleavened bread.” "
"1838","Exodus","12","21","Then Moses summoned all the elders of Israel and said to them, “Go at once and select the animals for your families and slaughter the Passover lamb.  "
"1839","Exodus","12","22","Take a bunch of hyssop, dip it into the blood in the basin and put some of the blood on the top and on both sides of the doorframe. None of you shall go out of the door of your house until morning.  "
"1840","Exodus","12","23","When the  Lord  goes through the land to strike down the Egyptians, he will see the blood on the top and sides of the doorframe and will pass over that doorway, and he will not permit the destroyer to enter your houses and strike you down. "
"1841","Exodus","12","24","“Obey these instructions as a lasting ordinance for you and your descendants.  "
"1842","Exodus","12","25","When you enter the land that the  Lord  will give you as he promised, observe this ceremony.  "
"1843","Exodus","12","26","And when your children ask you, ‘What does this ceremony mean to you?’  "
"1844","Exodus","12","27","then tell them, ‘It is the Passover sacrifice to the  Lord , who passed over the houses of the Israelites in Egypt and spared our homes when he struck down the Egyptians.’ ” Then the people bowed down and worshiped.  "
"1845","Exodus","12","28","The Israelites did just what the  Lord  commanded Moses and Aaron. "
"1846","Exodus","12","29","At midnight the  Lord  struck down all the firstborn in Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh, who sat on the throne, to the firstborn of the prisoner, who was in the dungeon, and the firstborn of all the livestock as well.  "
"1847","Exodus","12","30","Pharaoh and all his officials and all the Egyptians got up during the night, and there was loud wailing in Egypt, for there was not a house without someone dead. "
"1848","Exodus","12","31","During the night Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron and said, “Up! Leave my people, you and the Israelites! Go, worship the  Lord  as you have requested.  "
"1849","Exodus","12","32","Take your flocks and herds, as you have said, and go. And also bless me.” "
"1850","Exodus","12","33","The Egyptians urged the people to hurry and leave the country. “For otherwise,” they said, “we will all die!”  "
"1851","Exodus","12","34","So the people took their dough before the yeast was added, and carried it on their shoulders in kneading troughs wrapped in clothing.  "
"1852","Exodus","12","35","The Israelites did as Moses instructed and asked the Egyptians for articles of silver and gold and for clothing.  "
"1853","Exodus","12","36","The  Lord  had made the Egyptians favorably disposed toward the people, and they gave them what they asked for; so they plundered the Egyptians. "
"1854","Exodus","12","37","The Israelites journeyed from Rameses to Sukkoth. There were about six hundred thousand men on foot, besides women and children.  "
"1855","Exodus","12","38","Many other people went up with them, and also large droves of livestock, both flocks and herds.  "
"1856","Exodus","12","39","With the dough the Israelites had brought from Egypt, they baked loaves of unleavened bread. The dough was without yeast because they had been driven out of Egypt and did not have time to prepare food for themselves. "
"1857","Exodus","12","40","Now the length of time the Israelite people lived in Egypt  was 430 years.  "
"1858","Exodus","12","41","At the end of the 430 years, to the very day, all the  Lord ’s divisions left Egypt.  "
"1859","Exodus","12","42","Because the  Lord  kept vigil that night to bring them out of Egypt, on this night all the Israelites are to keep vigil to honor the  Lord  for the generations to come. "
"1860","Exodus","12","43","The  Lord  said to Moses and Aaron, “These are the regulations for the Passover meal: “No foreigner may eat it.  "
"1861","Exodus","12","44","Any slave you have bought may eat it after you have circumcised him,  "
"1862","Exodus","12","45","but a temporary resident or a hired worker may not eat it. "
"1863","Exodus","12","46","“It must be eaten inside the house; take none of the meat outside the house. Do not break any of the bones.  "
"1864","Exodus","12","47","The whole community of Israel must celebrate it. "
"1865","Exodus","12","48","“A foreigner residing among you who wants to celebrate the  Lord ’s Passover must have all the males in his household circumcised; then he may take part like one born in the land. No uncircumcised male may eat it.  "
"1866","Exodus","12","49","The same law applies both to the native-born and to the foreigner residing among you.” "
"1867","Exodus","12","50","All the Israelites did just what the  Lord  had commanded Moses and Aaron.  "
"1868","Exodus","12","51","And on that very day the  Lord  brought the Israelites out of Egypt by their divisions."
"1869","Exodus","13","1","The  Lord  said to Moses,  "
"1870","Exodus","13","2","“Consecrate to me every firstborn male. The first offspring of every womb among the Israelites belongs to me, whether human or animal.” "
"1871","Exodus","13","3","Then Moses said to the people, “Commemorate this day, the day you came out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery, because the  Lord  brought you out of it with a mighty hand. Eat nothing containing yeast.  "
"1872","Exodus","13","4","Today, in the month of Aviv, you are leaving.  "
"1873","Exodus","13","5","When the  Lord  brings you into the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Hivites and Jebusites—the land he swore to your ancestors to give you, a land flowing with milk and honey—you are to observe this ceremony in this month:  "
"1874","Exodus","13","6","For seven days eat bread made without yeast and on the seventh day hold a festival to the  Lord .  "
"1875","Exodus","13","7","Eat unleavened bread during those seven days; nothing with yeast in it is to be seen among you, nor shall any yeast be seen anywhere within your borders.  "
"1876","Exodus","13","8","On that day tell your son, ‘I do this because of what the  Lord  did for me when I came out of Egypt.’  "
"1877","Exodus","13","9","This observance will be for you like a sign on your hand and a reminder on your forehead that this law of the  Lord  is to be on your lips. For the  Lord  brought you out of Egypt with his mighty hand.  "
"1878","Exodus","13","10","You must keep this ordinance at the appointed time year after year. "
"1879","Exodus","13","11","“After the  Lord  brings you into the land of the Canaanites and gives it to you, as he promised on oath to you and your ancestors,  "
"1880","Exodus","13","12","you are to give over to the  Lord  the first offspring of every womb. All the firstborn males of your livestock belong to the  Lord .  "
"1881","Exodus","13","13","Redeem with a lamb every firstborn donkey, but if you do not redeem it, break its neck. Redeem every firstborn among your sons. "
"1882","Exodus","13","14","“In days to come, when your son asks you, ‘What does this mean?’ say to him, ‘With a mighty hand the  Lord  brought us out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery.  "
"1883","Exodus","13","15","When Pharaoh stubbornly refused to let us go, the  Lord  killed the firstborn of both people and animals in Egypt. This is why I sacrifice to the  Lord  the first male offspring of every womb and redeem each of my firstborn sons.’  "
"1884","Exodus","13","16","And it will be like a sign on your hand and a symbol on your forehead that the  Lord  brought us out of Egypt with his mighty hand.” "
"1885","Exodus","13","17","When Pharaoh let the people go, God did not lead them on the road through the Philistine country, though that was shorter. For God said, “If they face war, they might change their minds and return to Egypt.”  "
"1886","Exodus","13","18","So God led the people around by the desert road toward the Red Sea.  The Israelites went up out of Egypt ready for battle. "
"1887","Exodus","13","19","Moses took the bones of Joseph with him because Joseph had made the Israelites swear an oath. He had said, “God will surely come to your aid, and then you must carry my bones up with you from this place.” "
"1888","Exodus","13","20","After leaving Sukkoth they camped at Etham on the edge of the desert.  "
"1889","Exodus","13","21","By day the  Lord  went ahead of them in a pillar of cloud to guide them on their way and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light, so that they could travel by day or night.  "
"1890","Exodus","13","22","Neither the pillar of cloud by day nor the pillar of fire by night left its place in front of the people."
"1891","Exodus","14","1","Then the  Lord  said to Moses,  "
"1892","Exodus","14","2","“Tell the Israelites to turn back and encamp near Pi Hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea. They are to encamp by the sea, directly opposite Baal Zephon.  "
"1893","Exodus","14","3","Pharaoh will think, ‘The Israelites are wandering around the land in confusion, hemmed in by the desert.’  "
"1894","Exodus","14","4","And I will harden Pharaoh’s heart, and he will pursue them. But I will gain glory for myself through Pharaoh and all his army, and the Egyptians will know that I am the  Lord .” So the Israelites did this. "
"1895","Exodus","14","5","When the king of Egypt was told that the people had fled, Pharaoh and his officials changed their minds about them and said, “What have we done? We have let the Israelites go and have lost their services!”  "
"1896","Exodus","14","6","So he had his chariot made ready and took his army with him.  "
"1897","Exodus","14","7","He took six hundred of the best chariots, along with all the other chariots of Egypt, with officers over all of them.  "
"1898","Exodus","14","8","The  Lord  hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, so that he pursued the Israelites, who were marching out boldly.  "
"1899","Exodus","14","9","The Egyptians—all Pharaoh’s horses and chariots, horsemen  and troops—pursued the Israelites and overtook them as they camped by the sea near Pi Hahiroth, opposite Baal Zephon. "
"1900","Exodus","14","10","As Pharaoh approached, the Israelites looked up, and there were the Egyptians, marching after them. They were terrified and cried out to the  Lord .  "
"1901","Exodus","14","11","They said to Moses, “Was it because there were no graves in Egypt that you brought us to the desert to die? What have you done to us by bringing us out of Egypt?  "
"1902","Exodus","14","12","Didn’t we say to you in Egypt, ‘Leave us alone; let us serve the Egyptians’? It would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in the desert!” "
"1903","Exodus","14","13","Moses answered the people, “Do not be afraid. Stand firm and you will see the deliverance the  Lord  will bring you today. The Egyptians you see today you will never see again.  "
"1904","Exodus","14","14","The  Lord  will fight for you; you need only to be still.” "
"1905","Exodus","14","15","Then the  Lord  said to Moses, “Why are you crying out to me? Tell the Israelites to move on.  "
"1906","Exodus","14","16","Raise your staff and stretch out your hand over the sea to divide the water so that the Israelites can go through the sea on dry ground.  "
"1907","Exodus","14","17","I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians so that they will go in after them. And I will gain glory through Pharaoh and all his army, through his chariots and his horsemen.  "
"1908","Exodus","14","18","The Egyptians will know that I am the  Lord  when I gain glory through Pharaoh, his chariots and his horsemen.” "
"1909","Exodus","14","19","Then the angel of God, who had been traveling in front of Israel’s army, withdrew and went behind them. The pillar of cloud also moved from in front and stood behind them,  "
"1910","Exodus","14","20","coming between the armies of Egypt and Israel. Throughout the night the cloud brought darkness to the one side and light to the other side; so neither went near the other all night long. "
"1911","Exodus","14","21","Then Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and all that night the  Lord  drove the sea back with a strong east wind and turned it into dry land. The waters were divided,  "
"1912","Exodus","14","22","and the Israelites went through the sea on dry ground, with a wall of water on their right and on their left. "
"1913","Exodus","14","23","The Egyptians pursued them, and all Pharaoh’s horses and chariots and horsemen followed them into the sea.  "
"1914","Exodus","14","24","During the last watch of the night the  Lord  looked down from the pillar of fire and cloud at the Egyptian army and threw it into confusion.  "
"1915","Exodus","14","25","He jammed  the wheels of their chariots so that they had difficulty driving. And the Egyptians said, “Let’s get away from the Israelites! The  Lord  is fighting for them against Egypt.” "
"1916","Exodus","14","26","Then the  Lord  said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand over the sea so that the waters may flow back over the Egyptians and their chariots and horsemen.”  "
"1917","Exodus","14","27","Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and at daybreak the sea went back to its place. The Egyptians were fleeing toward  it, and the  Lord  swept them into the sea.  "
"1918","Exodus","14","28","The water flowed back and covered the chariots and horsemen—the entire army of Pharaoh that had followed the Israelites into the sea. Not one of them survived. "
"1919","Exodus","14","29","But the Israelites went through the sea on dry ground, with a wall of water on their right and on their left.  "
"1920","Exodus","14","30","That day the  Lord  saved Israel from the hands of the Egyptians, and Israel saw the Egyptians lying dead on the shore.  "
"1921","Exodus","14","31","And when the Israelites saw the mighty hand of the  Lord  displayed against the Egyptians, the people feared the  Lord  and put their trust in him and in Moses his servant."
"1922","Exodus","15","1","Then Moses and the Israelites sang this song to the  Lord : “I will sing to the  Lord , for he is highly exalted. Both horse and driver he has hurled into the sea. "
"1923","Exodus","15","2","“The  Lord  is my strength and my defense ; he has become my salvation. He is my God, and I will praise him, my father’s God, and I will exalt him. "
"1924","Exodus","15","3","The  Lord  is a warrior; the  Lord  is his name. "
"1925","Exodus","15","4","Pharaoh’s chariots and his army he has hurled into the sea. The best of Pharaoh’s officers are drowned in the Red Sea. "
"1926","Exodus","15","5","The deep waters have covered them; they sank to the depths like a stone. "
"1927","Exodus","15","6","Your right hand,  Lord , was majestic in power. Your right hand,  Lord , shattered the enemy. "
"1928","Exodus","15","7","“In the greatness of your majesty you threw down those who opposed you. You unleashed your burning anger; it consumed them like stubble. "
"1929","Exodus","15","8","By the blast of your nostrils the waters piled up. The surging waters stood up like a wall; the deep waters congealed in the heart of the sea. "
"1930","Exodus","15","9","The enemy boasted, ‘I will pursue, I will overtake them. I will divide the spoils; I will gorge myself on them. I will draw my sword and my hand will destroy them.’ "
"1931","Exodus","15","10","But you blew with your breath, and the sea covered them. They sank like lead in the mighty waters. "
"1932","Exodus","15","11","Who among the gods is like you,  Lord ? Who is like you— majestic in holiness, awesome in glory, working wonders? "
"1933","Exodus","15","12","“You stretch out your right hand, and the earth swallows your enemies. "
"1934","Exodus","15","13","In your unfailing love you will lead the people you have redeemed. In your strength you will guide them to your holy dwelling. "
"1935","Exodus","15","14","The nations will hear and tremble; anguish will grip the people of Philistia. "
"1936","Exodus","15","15","The chiefs of Edom will be terrified, the leaders of Moab will be seized with trembling, the people  of Canaan will melt away; "
"1937","Exodus","15","16","terror and dread will fall on them. By the power of your arm they will be as still as a stone— until your people pass by,  Lord , until the people you bought  pass by. "
"1938","Exodus","15","17","You will bring them in and plant them on the mountain of your inheritance— the place,  Lord , you made for your dwelling, the sanctuary, Lord, your hands established. "
"1939","Exodus","15","18","“The  Lord  reigns for ever and ever.” "
"1940","Exodus","15","19","When Pharaoh’s horses, chariots and horsemen  went into the sea, the  Lord  brought the waters of the sea back over them, but the Israelites walked through the sea on dry ground.  "
"1941","Exodus","15","20","Then Miriam the prophet, Aaron’s sister, took a timbrel in her hand, and all the women followed her, with timbrels and dancing.  "
"1942","Exodus","15","21","Miriam sang to them: “Sing to the  Lord , for he is highly exalted. Both horse and driver he has hurled into the sea.” "
"1943","Exodus","15","22","Then Moses led Israel from the Red Sea and they went into the Desert of Shur. For three days they traveled in the desert without finding water.  "
"1944","Exodus","15","23","When they came to Marah, they could not drink its water because it was bitter. (That is why the place is called Marah. )  "
"1945","Exodus","15","24","So the people grumbled against Moses, saying, “What are we to drink?” "
"1946","Exodus","15","25","Then Moses cried out to the  Lord , and the  Lord  showed him a piece of wood. He threw it into the water, and the water became fit to drink. There the  Lord  issued a ruling and instruction for them and put them to the test.  "
"1947","Exodus","15","26","He said, “If you listen carefully to the  Lord  your God and do what is right in his eyes, if you pay attention to his commands and keep all his decrees, I will not bring on you any of the diseases I brought on the Egyptians, for I am the  Lord , who heals you.” "
"1948","Exodus","15","27","Then they came to Elim, where there were twelve springs and seventy palm trees, and they camped there near the water."
"1949","Exodus","16","1","The whole Israelite community set out from Elim and came to the Desert of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after they had come out of Egypt.  "
"1950","Exodus","16","2","In the desert the whole community grumbled against Moses and Aaron.  "
"1951","Exodus","16","3","The Israelites said to them, “If only we had died by the  Lord ’s hand in Egypt! There we sat around pots of meat and ate all the food we wanted, but you have brought us out into this desert to starve this entire assembly to death.” "
"1952","Exodus","16","4","Then the  Lord  said to Moses, “I will rain down bread from heaven for you. The people are to go out each day and gather enough for that day. In this way I will test them and see whether they will follow my instructions.  "
"1953","Exodus","16","5","On the sixth day they are to prepare what they bring in, and that is to be twice as much as they gather on the other days.” "
"1954","Exodus","16","6","So Moses and Aaron said to all the Israelites, “In the evening you will know that it was the  Lord  who brought you out of Egypt,  "
"1955","Exodus","16","7","and in the morning you will see the glory of the  Lord , because he has heard your grumbling against him. Who are we, that you should grumble against us?”  "
"1956","Exodus","16","8","Moses also said, “You will know that it was the  Lord  when he gives you meat to eat in the evening and all the bread you want in the morning, because he has heard your grumbling against him. Who are we? You are not grumbling against us, but against the  Lord .” "
"1957","Exodus","16","9","Then Moses told Aaron, “Say to the entire Israelite community, ‘Come before the  Lord , for he has heard your grumbling.’ ” "
"1958","Exodus","16","10","While Aaron was speaking to the whole Israelite community, they looked toward the desert, and there was the glory of the  Lord  appearing in the cloud. "
"1959","Exodus","16","11","The  Lord  said to Moses,  "
"1960","Exodus","16","12","“I have heard the grumbling of the Israelites. Tell them, ‘At twilight you will eat meat, and in the morning you will be filled with bread. Then you will know that I am the  Lord  your God.’ ” "
"1961","Exodus","16","13","That evening quail came and covered the camp, and in the morning there was a layer of dew around the camp.  "
"1962","Exodus","16","14","When the dew was gone, thin flakes like frost on the ground appeared on the desert floor.  "
"1963","Exodus","16","15","When the Israelites saw it, they said to each other, “What is it?” For they did not know what it was. Moses said to them, “It is the bread the  Lord  has given you to eat.  "
"1964","Exodus","16","16","This is what the  Lord  has commanded: ‘Everyone is to gather as much as they need. Take an omer  for each person you have in your tent.’ ” "
"1965","Exodus","16","17","The Israelites did as they were told; some gathered much, some little.  "
"1966","Exodus","16","18","And when they measured it by the omer, the one who gathered much did not have too much, and the one who gathered little did not have too little. Everyone had gathered just as much as they needed. "
"1967","Exodus","16","19","Then Moses said to them, “No one is to keep any of it until morning.” "
"1968","Exodus","16","20","However, some of them paid no attention to Moses; they kept part of it until morning, but it was full of maggots and began to smell. So Moses was angry with them. "
"1969","Exodus","16","21","Each morning everyone gathered as much as they needed, and when the sun grew hot, it melted away.  "
"1970","Exodus","16","22","On the sixth day, they gathered twice as much—two omers  for each person—and the leaders of the community came and reported this to Moses.  "
"1971","Exodus","16","23","He said to them, “This is what the  Lord  commanded: ‘Tomorrow is to be a day of sabbath rest, a holy sabbath to the  Lord . So bake what you want to bake and boil what you want to boil. Save whatever is left and keep it until morning.’ ” "
"1972","Exodus","16","24","So they saved it until morning, as Moses commanded, and it did not stink or get maggots in it.  "
"1973","Exodus","16","25","“Eat it today,” Moses said, “because today is a sabbath to the  Lord . You will not find any of it on the ground today.  "
"1974","Exodus","16","26","Six days you are to gather it, but on the seventh day, the Sabbath, there will not be any.” "
"1975","Exodus","16","27","Nevertheless, some of the people went out on the seventh day to gather it, but they found none.  "
"1976","Exodus","16","28","Then the  Lord  said to Moses, “How long will you  refuse to keep my commands and my instructions?  "
"1977","Exodus","16","29","Bear in mind that the  Lord  has given you the Sabbath; that is why on the sixth day he gives you bread for two days. Everyone is to stay where they are on the seventh day; no one is to go out.”  "
"1978","Exodus","16","30","So the people rested on the seventh day. "
"1979","Exodus","16","31","The people of Israel called the bread manna.  It was white like coriander seed and tasted like wafers made with honey.  "
"1980","Exodus","16","32","Moses said, “This is what the  Lord  has commanded: ‘Take an omer of manna and keep it for the generations to come, so they can see the bread I gave you to eat in the wilderness when I brought you out of Egypt.’ ” "
"1981","Exodus","16","33","So Moses said to Aaron, “Take a jar and put an omer of manna in it. Then place it before the  Lord  to be kept for the generations to come.” "
"1982","Exodus","16","34","As the  Lord  commanded Moses, Aaron put the manna with the tablets of the covenant law, so that it might be preserved.  "
"1983","Exodus","16","35","The Israelites ate manna forty years, until they came to a land that was settled; they ate manna until they reached the border of Canaan. "
"1984","Exodus","16","36","(An omer is one-tenth of an ephah.)"
"1985","Exodus","17","1","The whole Israelite community set out from the Desert of Sin, traveling from place to place as the  Lord  commanded. They camped at Rephidim, but there was no water for the people to drink.  "
"1986","Exodus","17","2","So they quarreled with Moses and said, “Give us water to drink.” Moses replied, “Why do you quarrel with me? Why do you put the  Lord  to the test?” "
"1987","Exodus","17","3","But the people were thirsty for water there, and they grumbled against Moses. They said, “Why did you bring us up out of Egypt to make us and our children and livestock die of thirst?” "
"1988","Exodus","17","4","Then Moses cried out to the  Lord , “What am I to do with these people? They are almost ready to stone me.” "
"1989","Exodus","17","5","The  Lord  answered Moses, “Go out in front of the people. Take with you some of the elders of Israel and take in your hand the staff with which you struck the Nile, and go.  "
"1990","Exodus","17","6","I will stand there before you by the rock at Horeb. Strike the rock, and water will come out of it for the people to drink.” So Moses did this in the sight of the elders of Israel.  "
"1991","Exodus","17","7","And he called the place Massah  and Meribah  because the Israelites quarreled and because they tested the  Lord  saying, “Is the  Lord  among us or not?” "
"1992","Exodus","17","8","The Amalekites came and attacked the Israelites at Rephidim.  "
"1993","Exodus","17","9","Moses said to Joshua, “Choose some of our men and go out to fight the Amalekites. Tomorrow I will stand on top of the hill with the staff of God in my hands.” "
"1994","Exodus","17","10","So Joshua fought the Amalekites as Moses had ordered, and Moses, Aaron and Hur went to the top of the hill.  "
"1995","Exodus","17","11","As long as Moses held up his hands, the Israelites were winning, but whenever he lowered his hands, the Amalekites were winning.  "
"1996","Exodus","17","12","When Moses’ hands grew tired, they took a stone and put it under him and he sat on it. Aaron and Hur held his hands up—one on one side, one on the other—so that his hands remained steady till sunset.  "
"1997","Exodus","17","13","So Joshua overcame the Amalekite army with the sword. "
"1998","Exodus","17","14","Then the  Lord  said to Moses, “Write this on a scroll as something to be remembered and make sure that Joshua hears it, because I will completely blot out the name of Amalek from under heaven.” "
"1999","Exodus","17","15","Moses built an altar and called it The  Lord  is my Banner.  "
"2000","Exodus","17","16","He said, “Because hands were lifted up against  the throne of the  Lord ,  the  Lord  will be at war against the Amalekites from generation to generation.”"
"2001","Exodus","19","1","On the first day of the third month after the Israelites left Egypt—on that very day—they came to the Desert of Sinai.  "
"2002","Exodus","19","2","After they set out from Rephidim, they entered the Desert of Sinai, and Israel camped there in the desert in front of the mountain. "
"2003","Exodus","19","3","Then Moses went up to God, and the  Lord  called to him from the mountain and said, “This is what you are to say to the descendants of Jacob and what you are to tell the people of Israel:  "
"2004","Exodus","19","4","‘You yourselves have seen what I did to Egypt, and how I carried you on eagles’ wings and brought you to myself.  "
"2005","Exodus","19","5","Now if you obey me fully and keep my covenant, then out of all nations you will be my treasured possession. Although the whole earth is mine,  "
"2006","Exodus","19","6","you  will be for me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.’ These are the words you are to speak to the Israelites.” "
"2007","Exodus","19","7","So Moses went back and summoned the elders of the people and set before them all the words the  Lord  had commanded him to speak.  "
"2008","Exodus","19","8","The people all responded together, “We will do everything the  Lord  has said.” So Moses brought their answer back to the  Lord . "
"2009","Exodus","19","9","The  Lord  said to Moses, “I am going to come to you in a dense cloud, so that the people will hear me speaking with you and will always put their trust in you.” Then Moses told the  Lord  what the people had said. "
"2010","Exodus","19","10","And the  Lord  said to Moses, “Go to the people and consecrate them today and tomorrow. Have them wash their clothes  "
"2011","Exodus","19","11","and be ready by the third day, because on that day the  Lord  will come down on Mount Sinai in the sight of all the people.  "
"2012","Exodus","19","12","Put limits for the people around the mountain and tell them, ‘Be careful that you do not approach the mountain or touch the foot of it. Whoever touches the mountain is to be put to death.  "
"2013","Exodus","19","13","They are to be stoned or shot with arrows; not a hand is to be laid on them. No person or animal shall be permitted to live.’ Only when the ram’s horn sounds a long blast may they approach the mountain.” "
"2014","Exodus","19","14","After Moses had gone down the mountain to the people, he consecrated them, and they washed their clothes.  "
"2015","Exodus","19","15","Then he said to the people, “Prepare yourselves for the third day. Abstain from sexual relations.” "
"2016","Exodus","19","16","On the morning of the third day there was thunder and lightning, with a thick cloud over the mountain, and a very loud trumpet blast. Everyone in the camp trembled.  "
"2017","Exodus","19","17","Then Moses led the people out of the camp to meet with God, and they stood at the foot of the mountain.  "
"2018","Exodus","19","18","Mount Sinai was covered with smoke, because the  Lord  descended on it in fire. The smoke billowed up from it like smoke from a furnace, and the whole mountain  trembled violently.  "
"2019","Exodus","19","19","As the sound of the trumpet grew louder and louder, Moses spoke and the voice of God answered him. "
"2020","Exodus","19","20","The  Lord  descended to the top of Mount Sinai and called Moses to the top of the mountain. So Moses went up  "
"2021","Exodus","19","21","and the  Lord  said to him, “Go down and warn the people so they do not force their way through to see the  Lord  and many of them perish.  "
"2022","Exodus","19","22","Even the priests, who approach the  Lord , must consecrate themselves, or the  Lord  will break out against them.” "
"2023","Exodus","19","23","Moses said to the  Lord , “The people cannot come up Mount Sinai, because you yourself warned us, ‘Put limits around the mountain and set it apart as holy.’ ” "
"2024","Exodus","19","24","The  Lord  replied, “Go down and bring Aaron up with you. But the priests and the people must not force their way through to come up to the  Lord , or he will break out against them.” "
"2025","Exodus","19","25","So Moses went down to the people and told them."
"2026","Exodus","20","1","And God spoke all these words: "
"2027","Exodus","20","2","""I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery. "
"2028","Exodus","20","3","“You shall have no other gods before  me. "
"2029","Exodus","20","4","“You shall not make for yourself an image in the form of anything in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the waters below.  "
"2030","Exodus","20","5","You shall not bow down to them or worship them; for I, the  Lord  your God, am a jealous God, punishing the children for the sin of the parents to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me,  "
"2031","Exodus","20","6","but showing love to a thousand generations of those who love me and keep my commandments. "
"2032","Exodus","20","7","“You shall not misuse the name of the  Lord  your God, for the  Lord  will not hold anyone guiltless who misuses his name. "
"2033","Exodus","20","8","“Remember the Sabbath day by keeping it holy.  "
"2034","Exodus","20","9","Six days you shall labor and do all your work,  "
"2035","Exodus","20","10","but the seventh day is a sabbath to the  Lord  your God. On it you shall not do any work, neither you, nor your son or daughter, nor your male or female servant, nor your animals, nor any foreigner residing in your towns.  "
"2036","Exodus","20","11","For in six days the  Lord  made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, but he rested on the seventh day. Therefore the  Lord  blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy. "
"2037","Exodus","20","12","“Honor your father and your mother, so that you may live long in the land the  Lord  your God is giving you. "
"2038","Exodus","20","13","“You shall not murder. "
"2039","Exodus","20","14","“You shall not commit adultery. "
"2040","Exodus","20","15","“You shall not steal. "
"2041","Exodus","20","16","“You shall not give false testimony against your neighbor. "
"2042","Exodus","20","17","“You shall not covet your neighbor’s house. You shall not covet your neighbor’s wife, or his male or female servant, his ox or donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor.” "
"2043","Exodus","20","18","When the people saw the thunder and lightning and heard the trumpet and saw the mountain in smoke, they trembled with fear. They stayed at a distance  "
"2044","Exodus","20","19","and said to Moses, “Speak to us yourself and we will listen. But do not have God speak to us or we will die.” "
"2045","Exodus","20","20","Moses said to the people, “Do not be afraid. God has come to test you, so that the fear of God will be with you to keep you from sinning.” "
"2046","Exodus","20","21","The people remained at a distance, while Moses approached the thick darkness where God was. "
"2047","Exodus","20","22","Then the  Lord  said to Moses, “Tell the Israelites this: ‘You have seen for yourselves that I have spoken to you from heaven:  "
"2048","Exodus","20","23","Do not make any gods to be alongside me; do not make for yourselves gods of silver or gods of gold. "
"2049","Exodus","20","24","“ ‘Make an altar of earth for me and sacrifice on it your burnt offerings and fellowship offerings, your sheep and goats and your cattle. Wherever I cause my name to be honored, I will come to you and bless you.  "
"2050","Exodus","20","25","If you make an altar of stones for me, do not build it with dressed stones, for you will defile it if you use a tool on it.  "
"2051","Exodus","20","26","And do not go up to my altar on steps, or your private parts may be exposed.’"
"2052","Exodus","21","1","“These are the laws you are to set before them: "
"2053","Exodus","21","2","“If you buy a Hebrew servant, he is to serve you for six years. But in the seventh year, he shall go free, without paying anything.  "
"2054","Exodus","21","3","If he comes alone, he is to go free alone; but if he has a wife when he comes, she is to go with him.  "
"2055","Exodus","21","4","If his master gives him a wife and she bears him sons or daughters, the woman and her children shall belong to her master, and only the man shall go free. "
"2056","Exodus","21","5","“But if the servant declares, ‘I love my master and my wife and children and do not want to go free,’  "
"2057","Exodus","21","6","then his master must take him before the judges.  He shall take him to the door or the doorpost and pierce his ear with an awl. Then he will be his servant for life. "
"2058","Exodus","21","7","“If a man sells his daughter as a servant, she is not to go free as male servants do.  "
"2059","Exodus","21","8","If she does not please the master who has selected her for himself,  he must let her be redeemed. He has no right to sell her to foreigners, because he has broken faith with her.  "
"2060","Exodus","21","9","If he selects her for his son, he must grant her the rights of a daughter.  "
"2061","Exodus","21","10","If he marries another woman, he must not deprive the first one of her food, clothing and marital rights.  "
"2062","Exodus","21","11","If he does not provide her with these three things, she is to go free, without any payment of money. "
"2063","Exodus","21","12","“Anyone who strikes a person with a fatal blow is to be put to death.  "

"2071","Exodus","21","20","“Anyone who beats their male or female slave with a rod must be punished if the slave dies as a direct result,  "

"2324","Exodus","29","14","But burn the bull’s flesh and its hide and its intestines outside the camp. It is a sin offering. "

"2337","Exodus","29","27","“Consecrate those parts of the ordination ram that belong to Aaron and his sons: the breast that was waved and the thigh that was presented.  "
"2338","Exodus","29","28","This is always to be the perpetual share from the Israelites for Aaron and his sons. It is the contribution the Israelites are to make to the  Lord  from their fellowship offerings. "

"2343","Exodus","29","33","They are to eat these offerings by which atonement was made for their ordination and consecration. But no one else may eat them, because they are sacred.  "
"2344","Exodus","29","34","And if any of the meat of the ordination ram or any bread is left over till morning, burn it up. It must not be eaten, because it is sacred. "
"2345","Exodus","29","35","“Do for Aaron and his sons everything I have commanded you, taking seven days to ordain them.  "
"2346","Exodus","29","36","Sacrifice a bull each day as a sin offering to make atonement. Purify the altar by making atonement for it, and anoint it to consecrate it.  "

"2378","Exodus","30","22","Then the  Lord  said to Moses,  "
"2379","Exodus","30","23","“Take the following fine spices: 500 shekels  of liquid myrrh, half as much (that is, 250 shekels) of fragrant cinnamon, 250 shekels  of fragrant calamus,  "
"2380","Exodus","30","24","500 shekels of cassia—all according to the sanctuary shekel—and a hin of olive oil. "
"2381","Exodus","30","25","Make these into a sacred anointing oil, a fragrant blend, the work of a perfumer. It will be the sacred anointing oil.  "
"2382","Exodus","30","26","Then use it to anoint the tent of meeting, the ark of the covenant law,  "
"2383","Exodus","30","27","the table and all its articles, the lampstand and its accessories, the altar of incense,  "

"2388","Exodus","30","32","Do not pour it on anyone else’s body and do not make any other oil using the same formula. It is sacred, and you are to consider it sacred.  "
"2389","Exodus","30","33","Whoever makes perfume like it and puts it on anyone other than a priest must be cut off from their people.’ ” "
"2390","Exodus","30","34","Then the  Lord  said to Moses, “Take fragrant spices—gum resin, onycha and galbanum—and pure frankincense, all in equal amounts,  "
"2391","Exodus","30","35","and make a fragrant blend of incense, the work of a perfumer. It is to be salted and pure and sacred.  "
"2392","Exodus","30","36","Grind some of it to powder and place it in front of the ark of the covenant law in the tent of meeting, where I will meet with you. It shall be most holy to you.  "

"2394","Exodus","30","38","Whoever makes incense like it to enjoy its fragrance must be cut off from their people.”"
"2395","Exodus","31","1","Then the  Lord  said to Moses,  "
"2396","Exodus","31","2","“See, I have chosen Bezalel son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah,  "
"2397","Exodus","31","3","and I have filled him with the Spirit of God, with wisdom, with understanding, with knowledge and with all kinds of skills—  "
"2398","Exodus","31","4","to make artistic designs for work in gold, silver and bronze,  "
"2399","Exodus","31","5","to cut and set stones, to work in wood, and to engage in all kinds of crafts.  "
"2400","Exodus","31","6","Moreover, I have appointed Oholiab son of Ahisamak, of the tribe of Dan, to help him. Also I have given ability to all the skilled workers to make everything I have commanded you:  "
"2401","Exodus","31","7","the tent of meeting, the ark of the covenant law with the atonement cover on it, and all the other furnishings of the tent—  "
"2402","Exodus","31","8","the table and its articles, the pure gold lampstand and all its accessories, the altar of incense,  "
"2403","Exodus","31","9","the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils, the basin with its stand—  "
"2404","Exodus","31","10","and also the woven garments, both the sacred garments for Aaron the priest and the garments for his sons when they serve as priests,  "
"2405","Exodus","31","11","and the anointing oil and fragrant incense for the Holy Place. They are to make them just as I commanded you.” "
"2406","Exodus","31","12","Then the  Lord  said to Moses,  "
"2407","Exodus","31","13","“Say to the Israelites, ‘You must observe my Sabbaths. This will be a sign between me and you for the generations to come, so you may know that I am the  Lord , who makes you holy. "
"2408","Exodus","31","14","“ ‘Observe the Sabbath, because it is holy to you. Anyone who desecrates it is to be put to death; those who do any work on that day must be cut off from their people.  "
"2409","Exodus","31","15","For six days work is to be done, but the seventh day is a day of sabbath rest, holy to the  Lord . Whoever does any work on the Sabbath day is to be put to death.  "
"2410","Exodus","31","16","The Israelites are to observe the Sabbath, celebrating it for the generations to come as a lasting covenant.  "
"2411","Exodus","31","17","It will be a sign between me and the Israelites forever, for in six days the  Lord  made the heavens and the earth, and on the seventh day he rested and was refreshed.’ ” "
"2412","Exodus","31","18","When the  Lord  finished speaking to Moses on Mount Sinai, he gave him the two tablets of the covenant law, the tablets of stone inscribed by the finger of God."
"2413","Exodus","32","1","When the people saw that Moses was so long in coming down from the mountain, they gathered around Aaron and said, “Come, make us gods  who will go before us. As for this fellow Moses who brought us up out of Egypt, we don’t know what has happened to him.” "
"2414","Exodus","32","2","Aaron answered them, “Take off the gold earrings that your wives, your sons and your daughters are wearing, and bring them to me.”  "
"2415","Exodus","32","3","So all the people took off their earrings and brought them to Aaron.  "
"2416","Exodus","32","4","He took what they handed him and made it into an idol cast in the shape of a calf, fashioning it with a tool. Then they said, “These are your gods,  Israel, who brought you up out of Egypt.” "
"2417","Exodus","32","5","When Aaron saw this, he built an altar in front of the calf and announced, “Tomorrow there will be a festival to the  Lord .”  "
"2418","Exodus","32","6","So the next day the people rose early and sacrificed burnt offerings and presented fellowship offerings. Afterward they sat down to eat and drink and got up to indulge in revelry. "
"2419","Exodus","32","7","Then the  Lord  said to Moses, “Go down, because your people, whom you brought up out of Egypt, have become corrupt.  "
"2420","Exodus","32","8","They have been quick to turn away from what I commanded them and have made themselves an idol cast in the shape of a calf. They have bowed down to it and sacrificed to it and have said, ‘These are your gods, Israel, who brought you up out of Egypt.’ "
"2421","Exodus","32","9","“I have seen these people,” the  Lord  said to Moses, “and they are a stiff-necked people.  "
"2422","Exodus","32","10","Now leave me alone so that my anger may burn against them and that I may destroy them. Then I will make you into a great nation.” "
"2423","Exodus","32","11","But Moses sought the favor of the  Lord  his God. “ Lord ,” he said, “why should your anger burn against your people, whom you brought out of Egypt with great power and a mighty hand?  "
"2424","Exodus","32","12","Why should the Egyptians say, ‘It was with evil intent that he brought them out, to kill them in the mountains and to wipe them off the face of the earth’? Turn from your fierce anger; relent and do not bring disaster on your people.  "
"2425","Exodus","32","13","Remember your servants Abraham, Isaac and Israel, to whom you swore by your own self: ‘I will make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and I will give your descendants all this land I promised them, and it will be their inheritance forever.’ ”  "
"2426","Exodus","32","14","Then the  Lord  relented and did not bring on his people the disaster he had threatened. "
"2427","Exodus","32","15","Moses turned and went down the mountain with the two tablets of the covenant law in his hands. They were inscribed on both sides, front and back.  "
"2428","Exodus","32","16","The tablets were the work of God; the writing was the writing of God, engraved on the tablets. "
"2429","Exodus","32","17","When Joshua heard the noise of the people shouting, he said to Moses, “There is the sound of war in the camp.” "
"2430","Exodus","32","18","Moses replied: “It is not the sound of victory, it is not the sound of defeat; it is the sound of singing that I hear.” "
"2431","Exodus","32","19","When Moses approached the camp and saw the calf and the dancing, his anger burned and he threw the tablets out of his hands, breaking them to pieces at the foot of the mountain.  "
"2432","Exodus","32","20","And he took the calf the people had made and burned it in the fire; then he ground it to powder, scattered it on the water and made the Israelites drink it. "
"2433","Exodus","32","21","He said to Aaron, “What did these people do to you, that you led them into such great sin?” "
"2434","Exodus","32","22","“Do not be angry, my lord,” Aaron answered. “You know how prone these people are to evil.  "
"2435","Exodus","32","23","They said to me, ‘Make us gods who will go before us. As for this fellow Moses who brought us up out of Egypt, we don’t know what has happened to him.’  "
"2436","Exodus","32","24","So I told them, ‘Whoever has any gold jewelry, take it off.’ Then they gave me the gold, and I threw it into the fire, and out came this calf!” "
"2437","Exodus","32","25","Moses saw that the people were running wild and that Aaron had let them get out of control and so become a laughingstock to their enemies.  "
"2438","Exodus","32","26","So he stood at the entrance to the camp and said, “Whoever is for the  Lord , come to me.” And all the Levites rallied to him. "
"2439","Exodus","32","27","Then he said to them, “This is what the  Lord , the God of Israel, says: ‘Each man strap a sword to his side. Go back and forth through the camp from one end to the other, each killing his brother and friend and neighbor.’ ”  "
"2440","Exodus","32","28","The Levites did as Moses commanded, and that day about three thousand of the people died.  "
"2441","Exodus","32","29","Then Moses said, “You have been set apart to the  Lord  today, for you were against your own sons and brothers, and he has blessed you this day.” "
"2442","Exodus","32","30","The next day Moses said to the people, “You have committed a great sin. But now I will go up to the  Lord ; perhaps I can make atonement for your sin.” "
"2443","Exodus","32","31","So Moses went back to the  Lord  and said, “Oh, what a great sin these people have committed! They have made themselves gods of gold.  "
"2444","Exodus","32","32","But now, please forgive their sin—but if not, then blot me out of the book you have written.” "
"2445","Exodus","32","33","The  Lord  replied to Moses, “Whoever has sinned against me I will blot out of my book.  "
"2446","Exodus","32","34","Now go, lead the people to the place I spoke of, and my angel will go before you. However, when the time comes for me to punish, I will punish them for their sin.” "
"2447","Exodus","32","35","And the  Lord  struck the people with a plague because of what they did with the calf Aaron had made."
"2448","Exodus","33","1","Then the  Lord  said to Moses, “Leave this place, you and the people you brought up out of Egypt, and go up to the land I promised on oath to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, saying, ‘I will give it to your descendants.’  "
"2449","Exodus","33","2","I will send an angel before you and drive out the Canaanites, Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites.  "
"2450","Exodus","33","3","Go up to the land flowing with milk and honey. But I will not go with you, because you are a stiff-necked people and I might destroy you on the way.” "
"2451","Exodus","33","4","When the people heard these distressing words, they began to mourn and no one put on any ornaments.  "
"2452","Exodus","33","5","For the  Lord  had said to Moses, “Tell the Israelites, ‘You are a stiff-necked people. If I were to go with you even for a moment, I might destroy you. Now take off your ornaments and I will decide what to do with you.’ ”  "
"2453","Exodus","33","6","So the Israelites stripped off their ornaments at Mount Horeb. "
"2454","Exodus","33","7","Now Moses used to take a tent and pitch it outside the camp some distance away, calling it the “tent of meeting.” Anyone inquiring of the  Lord  would go to the tent of meeting outside the camp.  "
"2455","Exodus","33","8","And whenever Moses went out to the tent, all the people rose and stood at the entrances to their tents, watching Moses until he entered the tent.  "
"2456","Exodus","33","9","As Moses went into the tent, the pillar of cloud would come down and stay at the entrance, while the  Lord  spoke with Moses.  "
"2457","Exodus","33","10","Whenever the people saw the pillar of cloud standing at the entrance to the tent, they all stood and worshiped, each at the entrance to their tent.  "
"2458","Exodus","33","11","The  Lord  would speak to Moses face to face, as one speaks to a friend. Then Moses would return to the camp, but his young aide Joshua son of Nun did not leave the tent. "
"2459","Exodus","33","12","Moses said to the  Lord , “You have been telling me, ‘Lead these people,’ but you have not let me know whom you will send with me. You have said, ‘I know you by name and you have found favor with me.’  "
"2460","Exodus","33","13","If you are pleased with me, teach me your ways so I may know you and continue to find favor with you. Remember that this nation is your people.” "
"2461","Exodus","33","14","The  Lord  replied, “My Presence will go with you, and I will give you rest.” "
"2462","Exodus","33","15","Then Moses said to him, “If your Presence does not go with us, do not send us up from here.  "
"2463","Exodus","33","16","How will anyone know that you are pleased with me and with your people unless you go with us? What else will distinguish me and your people from all the other people on the face of the earth?” "
"2464","Exodus","33","17","And the  Lord  said to Moses, “I will do the very thing you have asked, because I am pleased with you and I know you by name.” "
"2465","Exodus","33","18","Then Moses said, “Now show me your glory.” "
"2466","Exodus","33","19","And the  Lord  said, “I will cause all my goodness to pass in front of you, and I will proclaim my name, the  Lord , in your presence. I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.  "
"2467","Exodus","33","20","But,” he said, “you cannot see my face, for no one may see me and live.” "
"2468","Exodus","33","21","Then the  Lord  said, “There is a place near me where you may stand on a rock.  "
"2469","Exodus","33","22","When my glory passes by, I will put you in a cleft in the rock and cover you with my hand until I have passed by.  "
"2470","Exodus","33","23","Then I will remove my hand and you will see my back; but my face must not be seen.”"
"2471","Exodus","34","1","The  Lord  said to Moses, “Chisel out two stone tablets like the first ones, and I will write on them the words that were on the first tablets, which you broke.  "
"2472","Exodus","34","2","Be ready in the morning, and then come up on Mount Sinai. Present yourself to me there on top of the mountain.  "
"2473","Exodus","34","3","No one is to come with you or be seen anywhere on the mountain; not even the flocks and herds may graze in front of the mountain.” "
"2474","Exodus","34","4","So Moses chiseled out two stone tablets like the first ones and went up Mount Sinai early in the morning, as the  Lord  had commanded him; and he carried the two stone tablets in his hands.  "
"2475","Exodus","34","5","Then the  Lord  came down in the cloud and stood there with him and proclaimed his name, the  Lord .  "
"2476","Exodus","34","6","And he passed in front of Moses, proclaiming, “The  Lord , the  Lord , the compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger, abounding in love and faithfulness,  "
"2477","Exodus","34","7","maintaining love to thousands, and forgiving wickedness, rebellion and sin. Yet he does not leave the guilty unpunished; he punishes the children and their children for the sin of the parents to the third and fourth generation.” "
"2478","Exodus","34","8","Moses bowed to the ground at once and worshiped.  "
"2479","Exodus","34","9","“Lord,” he said, “if I have found favor in your eyes, then let the Lord go with us. Although this is a stiff-necked people, forgive our wickedness and our sin, and take us as your inheritance.” "
"2480","Exodus","34","10","Then the  Lord  said: “I am making a covenant with you. Before all your people I will do wonders never before done in any nation in all the world. The people you live among will see how awesome is the work that I, the  Lord , will do for you.  "
"2481","Exodus","34","11","Obey what I command you today. I will drive out before you the Amorites, Canaanites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites.  "
"2482","Exodus","34","12","Be careful not to make a treaty with those who live in the land where you are going, or they will be a snare among you.  "
"2483","Exodus","34","13","Break down their altars, smash their sacred stones and cut down their Asherah poles.   "
"2484","Exodus","34","14","Do not worship any other god, for the  Lord , whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God. "
"2485","Exodus","34","15","“Be careful not to make a treaty with those who live in the land; for when they prostitute themselves to their gods and sacrifice to them, they will invite you and you will eat their sacrifices.  "
"2486","Exodus","34","16","And when you choose some of their daughters as wives for your sons and those daughters prostitute themselves to their gods, they will lead your sons to do the same. "
"2487","Exodus","34","17","“Do not make any idols. "
"2488","Exodus","34","18","“Celebrate the Festival of Unleavened Bread. For seven days eat bread made without yeast, as I commanded you. Do this at the appointed time in the month of Aviv, for in that month you came out of Egypt. "
"2489","Exodus","34","19","“The first offspring of every womb belongs to me, including all the firstborn males of your livestock, whether from herd or flock.  "

"2492","Exodus","34","22","“Celebrate the Festival of Weeks with the firstfruits of the wheat harvest, and the Festival of Ingathering at the turn of the year.   "
"2493","Exodus","34","23","Three times a year all your men are to appear before the Sovereign  Lord , the God of Israel.  "
"2494","Exodus","34","24","I will drive out nations before you and enlarge your territory, and no one will covet your land when you go up three times each year to appear before the  Lord  your God. "
"2495","Exodus","34","25","“Do not offer the blood of a sacrifice to me along with anything containing yeast, and do not let any of the sacrifice from the Passover Festival remain until morning. "
"2496","Exodus","34","26","“Bring the best of the firstfruits of your soil to the house of the  Lord  your God. “Do not cook a young goat in its mother’s milk.” "
"2497","Exodus","34","27","Then the  Lord  said to Moses, “Write down these words, for in accordance with these words I have made a covenant with you and with Israel.”  "
"2498","Exodus","34","28","Moses was there with the  Lord  forty days and forty nights without eating bread or drinking water. And he wrote on the tablets the words of the covenant—the Ten Commandments. "
"2499","Exodus","34","29","When Moses came down from Mount Sinai with the two tablets of the covenant law in his hands, he was not aware that his face was radiant because he had spoken with the  Lord .  "
"2500","Exodus","34","30","When Aaron and all the Israelites saw Moses, his face was radiant, and they were afraid to come near him.  "
"2501","Exodus","34","31","But Moses called to them; so Aaron and all the leaders of the community came back to him, and he spoke to them.  "
"2502","Exodus","34","32","Afterward all the Israelites came near him, and he gave them all the commands the  Lord  had given him on Mount Sinai. "
"2503","Exodus","34","33","When Moses finished speaking to them, he put a veil over his face.  "
"2504","Exodus","34","34","But whenever he entered the  Lord ’s presence to speak with him, he removed the veil until he came out. And when he came out and told the Israelites what he had been commanded,  "
"2505","Exodus","34","35","they saw that his face was radiant. Then Moses would put the veil back over his face until he went in to speak with the  Lord ."
"2506","Exodus","35","1","Moses assembled the whole Israelite community and said to them, “These are the things the  Lord  has commanded you to do:  "
"2507","Exodus","35","2","For six days, work is to be done, but the seventh day shall be your holy day, a day of sabbath rest to the  Lord . Whoever does any work on it is to be put to death.  "
"2508","Exodus","35","3","Do not light a fire in any of your dwellings on the Sabbath day.” "
"2509","Exodus","35","4","Moses said to the whole Israelite community, “This is what the  Lord  has commanded:  "
"2510","Exodus","35","5","From what you have, take an offering for the  Lord . Everyone who is willing is to bring to the  Lord  an offering of gold, silver and bronze;  "
"2511","Exodus","35","6","blue, purple and scarlet yarn and fine linen; goat hair;  "
"2512","Exodus","35","7","ram skins dyed red and another type of durable leather ; acacia wood;  "
"2513","Exodus","35","8","olive oil for the light; spices for the anointing oil and for the fragrant incense;  "
"2514","Exodus","35","9","and onyx stones and other gems to be mounted on the ephod and breastpiece. "
"2515","Exodus","35","10","“All who are skilled among you are to come and make everything the  Lord  has commanded:  "
"2516","Exodus","35","11","the tabernacle with its tent and its covering, clasps, frames, crossbars, posts and bases;  "
"2517","Exodus","35","12","the ark with its poles and the atonement cover and the curtain that shields it;  "
"2518","Exodus","35","13","the table with its poles and all its articles and the bread of the Presence;  "
"2519","Exodus","35","14","the lampstand that is for light with its accessories, lamps and oil for the light;  "
"2520","Exodus","35","15","the altar of incense with its poles, the anointing oil and the fragrant incense; the curtain for the doorway at the entrance to the tabernacle;  "
"2521","Exodus","35","16","the altar of burnt offering with its bronze grating, its poles and all its utensils; the bronze basin with its stand;  "
"2522","Exodus","35","17","the curtains of the courtyard with its posts and bases, and the curtain for the entrance to the courtyard;  "
"2523","Exodus","35","18","the tent pegs for the tabernacle and for the courtyard, and their ropes;  "
"2524","Exodus","35","19","the woven garments worn for ministering in the sanctuary—both the sacred garments for Aaron the priest and the garments for his sons when they serve as priests.” "
"2525","Exodus","35","20","Then the whole Israelite community withdrew from Moses’ presence,  "
"2526","Exodus","35","21","and everyone who was willing and whose heart moved them came and brought an offering to the  Lord  for the work on the tent of meeting, for all its service, and for the sacred garments.  "
"2527","Exodus","35","22","All who were willing, men and women alike, came and brought gold jewelry of all kinds: brooches, earrings, rings and ornaments. They all presented their gold as a wave offering to the  Lord .  "
"2528","Exodus","35","23","Everyone who had blue, purple or scarlet yarn or fine linen, or goat hair, ram skins dyed red or the other durable leather brought them.  "
"2529","Exodus","35","24","Those presenting an offering of silver or bronze brought it as an offering to the  Lord , and everyone who had acacia wood for any part of the work brought it.  "
"2530","Exodus","35","25","Every skilled woman spun with her hands and brought what she had spun—blue, purple or scarlet yarn or fine linen.  "
"2531","Exodus","35","26","And all the women who were willing and had the skill spun the goat hair.  "
"2532","Exodus","35","27","The leaders brought onyx stones and other gems to be mounted on the ephod and breastpiece.  "
"2533","Exodus","35","28","They also brought spices and olive oil for the light and for the anointing oil and for the fragrant incense.  "
"2534","Exodus","35","29","All the Israelite men and women who were willing brought to the  Lord  freewill offerings for all the work the  Lord  through Moses had commanded them to do. "
"2535","Exodus","35","30","Then Moses said to the Israelites, “See, the  Lord  has chosen Bezalel son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah,  "
"2536","Exodus","35","31","and he has filled him with the Spirit of God, with wisdom, with understanding, with knowledge and with all kinds of skills—  "
"2537","Exodus","35","32","to make artistic designs for work in gold, silver and bronze,  "
"2538","Exodus","35","33","to cut and set stones, to work in wood and to engage in all kinds of artistic crafts.  "
"2539","Exodus","35","34","And he has given both him and Oholiab son of Ahisamak, of the tribe of Dan, the ability to teach others.  "
"2540","Exodus","35","35","He has filled them with skill to do all kinds of work as engravers, designers, embroiderers in blue, purple and scarlet yarn and fine linen, and weavers—all of them skilled workers and designers."
"2541","Exodus","36","1","So Bezalel, Oholiab and every skilled person to whom the  Lord  has given skill and ability to know how to carry out all the work of constructing the sanctuary are to do the work just as the  Lord  has commanded.” "
"2542","Exodus","36","2","Then Moses summoned Bezalel and Oholiab and every skilled person to whom the  Lord  had given ability and who was willing to come and do the work.  "
"2543","Exodus","36","3","They received from Moses all the offerings the Israelites had brought to carry out the work of constructing the sanctuary. And the people continued to bring freewill offerings morning after morning.  "
"2544","Exodus","36","4","So all the skilled workers who were doing all the work on the sanctuary left what they were doing  "
"2545","Exodus","36","5","and said to Moses, “The people are bringing more than enough for doing the work the  Lord  commanded to be done.” "
"2546","Exodus","36","6","Then Moses gave an order and they sent this word throughout the camp: “No man or woman is to make anything else as an offering for the sanctuary.” And so the people were restrained from bringing more,  "
"2547","Exodus","36","7","because what they already had was more than enough to do all the work. "
"2548","Exodus","36","8","All those who were skilled among the workers made the tabernacle with ten curtains of finely twisted linen and blue, purple and scarlet yarn, with cherubim woven into them by expert hands.  "
"2549","Exodus","36","9","All the curtains were the same size—twenty-eight cubits long and four cubits wide.   "
"2550","Exodus","36","10","They joined five of the curtains together and did the same with the other five.  "
"2551","Exodus","36","11","Then they made loops of blue material along the edge of the end curtain in one set, and the same was done with the end curtain in the other set.  "
"2552","Exodus","36","12","They also made fifty loops on one curtain and fifty loops on the end curtain of the other set, with the loops opposite each other.  "
"2553","Exodus","36","13","Then they made fifty gold clasps and used them to fasten the two sets of curtains together so that the tabernacle was a unit. "
"2554","Exodus","36","14","They made curtains of goat hair for the tent over the tabernacle—eleven altogether.  "
"2555","Exodus","36","15","All eleven curtains were the same size—thirty cubits long and four cubits wide.   "
"2556","Exodus","36","16","They joined five of the curtains into one set and the other six into another set.  "
"2557","Exodus","36","17","Then they made fifty loops along the edge of the end curtain in one set and also along the edge of the end curtain in the other set.  "
"2558","Exodus","36","18","They made fifty bronze clasps to fasten the tent together as a unit.  "
"2559","Exodus","36","19","Then they made for the tent a covering of ram skins dyed red, and over that a covering of the other durable leather. "
"2560","Exodus","36","20","They made upright frames of acacia wood for the tabernacle.  "
"2561","Exodus","36","21","Each frame was ten cubits long and a cubit and a half wide,   "
"2562","Exodus","36","22","with two projections set parallel to each other. They made all the frames of the tabernacle in this way.  "
"2563","Exodus","36","23","They made twenty frames for the south side of the tabernacle  "
"2564","Exodus","36","24","and made forty silver bases to go under them—two bases for each frame, one under each projection.  "
"2565","Exodus","36","25","For the other side, the north side of the tabernacle, they made twenty frames  "
"2566","Exodus","36","26","and forty silver bases—two under each frame.  "
"2567","Exodus","36","27","They made six frames for the far end, that is, the west end of the tabernacle,  "
"2568","Exodus","36","28","and two frames were made for the corners of the tabernacle at the far end.  "
"2569","Exodus","36","29","At these two corners the frames were double from the bottom all the way to the top and fitted into a single ring; both were made alike.  "
"2570","Exodus","36","30","So there were eight frames and sixteen silver bases—two under each frame. "
"2571","Exodus","36","31","They also made crossbars of acacia wood: five for the frames on one side of the tabernacle,  "
"2572","Exodus","36","32","five for those on the other side, and five for the frames on the west, at the far end of the tabernacle.  "
"2573","Exodus","36","33","They made the center crossbar so that it extended from end to end at the middle of the frames.  "
"2574","Exodus","36","34","They overlaid the frames with gold and made gold rings to hold the crossbars. They also overlaid the crossbars with gold. "
"2575","Exodus","36","35","They made the curtain of blue, purple and scarlet yarn and finely twisted linen, with cherubim woven into it by a skilled worker.  "
"2576","Exodus","36","36","They made four posts of acacia wood for it and overlaid them with gold. They made gold hooks for them and cast their four silver bases.  "
"2577","Exodus","36","37","For the entrance to the tent they made a curtain of blue, purple and scarlet yarn and finely twisted linen—the work of an embroiderer;  "
"2578","Exodus","36","38","and they made five posts with hooks for them. They overlaid the tops of the posts and their bands with gold and made their five bases of bronze."
"2579","Exodus","37","1","Bezalel made the ark of acacia wood—two and a half cubits long, a cubit and a half wide, and a cubit and a half high.   "
"2580","Exodus","37","2","He overlaid it with pure gold, both inside and out, and made a gold molding around it.  "
"2581","Exodus","37","3","He cast four gold rings for it and fastened them to its four feet, with two rings on one side and two rings on the other.  "
"2582","Exodus","37","4","Then he made poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold.  "
"2583","Exodus","37","5","And he inserted the poles into the rings on the sides of the ark to carry it. "
"2584","Exodus","37","6","He made the atonement cover of pure gold—two and a half cubits long and a cubit and a half wide.  "
"2585","Exodus","37","7","Then he made two cherubim out of hammered gold at the ends of the cover.  "
"2586","Exodus","37","8","He made one cherub on one end and the second cherub on the other; at the two ends he made them of one piece with the cover.  "
"2587","Exodus","37","9","The cherubim had their wings spread upward, overshadowing the cover with them. The cherubim faced each other, looking toward the cover. "
"2588","Exodus","37","10","They  made the table of acacia wood—two cubits long, a cubit wide and a cubit and a half high.   "
"2589","Exodus","37","11","Then they overlaid it with pure gold and made a gold molding around it.  "
"2590","Exodus","37","12","They also made around it a rim a handbreadth  wide and put a gold molding on the rim.  "
"2591","Exodus","37","13","They cast four gold rings for the table and fastened them to the four corners, where the four legs were.  "
"2592","Exodus","37","14","The rings were put close to the rim to hold the poles used in carrying the table.  "
"2593","Exodus","37","15","The poles for carrying the table were made of acacia wood and were overlaid with gold.  "
"2594","Exodus","37","16","And they made from pure gold the articles for the table—its plates and dishes and bowls and its pitchers for the pouring out of drink offerings. "
"2595","Exodus","37","17","They made the lampstand of pure gold. They hammered out its base and shaft, and made its flowerlike cups, buds and blossoms of one piece with them.  "
"2596","Exodus","37","18","Six branches extended from the sides of the lampstand—three on one side and three on the other.  "
"2597","Exodus","37","19","Three cups shaped like almond flowers with buds and blossoms were on one branch, three on the next branch and the same for all six branches extending from the lampstand.  "
"2598","Exodus","37","20","And on the lampstand were four cups shaped like almond flowers with buds and blossoms.  "
"2599","Exodus","37","21","One bud was under the first pair of branches extending from the lampstand, a second bud under the second pair, and a third bud under the third pair—six branches in all.  "
"2600","Exodus","37","22","The buds and the branches were all of one piece with the lampstand, hammered out of pure gold. "
"2601","Exodus","37","23","They made its seven lamps, as well as its wick trimmers and trays, of pure gold.  "
"2602","Exodus","37","24","They made the lampstand and all its accessories from one talent  of pure gold. "
"2603","Exodus","37","25","They made the altar of incense out of acacia wood. It was square, a cubit long and a cubit wide and two cubits high —its horns of one piece with it.  "
"2604","Exodus","37","26","They overlaid the top and all the sides and the horns with pure gold, and made a gold molding around it.  "
"2605","Exodus","37","27","They made two gold rings below the molding—two on each of the opposite sides—to hold the poles used to carry it.  "
"2606","Exodus","37","28","They made the poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold. "
"2607","Exodus","37","29","They also made the sacred anointing oil and the pure, fragrant incense—the work of a perfumer."
"2608","Exodus","38","1","They  built the altar of burnt offering of acacia wood, three cubits  high; it was square, five cubits long and five cubits wide.   "
"2609","Exodus","38","2","They made a horn at each of the four corners, so that the horns and the altar were of one piece, and they overlaid the altar with bronze.  "
"2610","Exodus","38","3","They made all its utensils of bronze—its pots, shovels, sprinkling bowls, meat forks and firepans.  "
"2611","Exodus","38","4","They made a grating for the altar, a bronze network, to be under its ledge, halfway up the altar.  "
"2612","Exodus","38","5","They cast bronze rings to hold the poles for the four corners of the bronze grating.  "
"2613","Exodus","38","6","They made the poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with bronze.  "
"2614","Exodus","38","7","They inserted the poles into the rings so they would be on the sides of the altar for carrying it. They made it hollow, out of boards. "
"2615","Exodus","38","8","They made the bronze basin and its bronze stand from the mirrors of the women who served at the entrance to the tent of meeting. "
"2616","Exodus","38","9","Next they made the courtyard. The south side was a hundred cubits  long and had curtains of finely twisted linen,  "
"2617","Exodus","38","10","with twenty posts and twenty bronze bases, and with silver hooks and bands on the posts.  "
"2618","Exodus","38","11","The north side was also a hundred cubits long and had twenty posts and twenty bronze bases, with silver hooks and bands on the posts. "
"2619","Exodus","38","12","The west end was fifty cubits  wide and had curtains, with ten posts and ten bases, with silver hooks and bands on the posts.  "
"2620","Exodus","38","13","The east end, toward the sunrise, was also fifty cubits wide.  "
"2621","Exodus","38","14","Curtains fifteen cubits  long were on one side of the entrance, with three posts and three bases,  "
"2622","Exodus","38","15","and curtains fifteen cubits long were on the other side of the entrance to the courtyard, with three posts and three bases.  "
"2623","Exodus","38","16","All the curtains around the courtyard were of finely twisted linen.  "
"2624","Exodus","38","17","The bases for the posts were bronze. The hooks and bands on the posts were silver, and their tops were overlaid with silver; so all the posts of the courtyard had silver bands. "
"2625","Exodus","38","18","The curtain for the entrance to the courtyard was made of blue, purple and scarlet yarn and finely twisted linen—the work of an embroiderer. It was twenty cubits  long and, like the curtains of the courtyard, five cubits  high,  "
"2626","Exodus","38","19","with four posts and four bronze bases. Their hooks and bands were silver, and their tops were overlaid with silver.  "
"2627","Exodus","38","20","All the tent pegs of the tabernacle and of the surrounding courtyard were bronze. "
"2628","Exodus","38","21","These are the amounts of the materials used for the tabernacle, the tabernacle of the covenant law, which were recorded at Moses’ command by the Levites under the direction of Ithamar son of Aaron, the priest.  "
"2629","Exodus","38","22","(Bezalel son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, made everything the  Lord  commanded Moses;  "
"2630","Exodus","38","23","with him was Oholiab son of Ahisamak, of the tribe of Dan—an engraver and designer, and an embroiderer in blue, purple and scarlet yarn and fine linen.)  "
"2631","Exodus","38","24","The total amount of the gold from the wave offering used for all the work on the sanctuary was 29 talents and 730 shekels,  according to the sanctuary shekel. "
"2632","Exodus","38","25","The silver obtained from those of the community who were counted in the census was 100 talents  and 1,775 shekels,  according to the sanctuary shekel—  "
"2633","Exodus","38","26","one beka per person, that is, half a shekel,  according to the sanctuary shekel, from everyone who had crossed over to those counted, twenty years old or more, a total of 603,550 men.  "
"2634","Exodus","38","27","The 100 talents of silver were used to cast the bases for the sanctuary and for the curtain—100 bases from the 100 talents, one talent for each base.  "
"2635","Exodus","38","28","They used the 1,775 shekels to make the hooks for the posts, to overlay the tops of the posts, and to make their bands. "
"2636","Exodus","38","29","The bronze from the wave offering was 70 talents and 2,400 shekels.   "
"2637","Exodus","38","30","They used it to make the bases for the entrance to the tent of meeting, the bronze altar with its bronze grating and all its utensils,  "
"2638","Exodus","38","31","the bases for the surrounding courtyard and those for its entrance and all the tent pegs for the tabernacle and those for the surrounding courtyard."
"2639","Exodus","39","1","From the blue, purple and scarlet yarn they made woven garments for ministering in the sanctuary. They also made sacred garments for Aaron, as the  Lord  commanded Moses. "
"2640","Exodus","39","2","They  made the ephod of gold, and of blue, purple and scarlet yarn, and of finely twisted linen.  "
"2641","Exodus","39","3","They hammered out thin sheets of gold and cut strands to be worked into the blue, purple and scarlet yarn and fine linen—the work of skilled hands.  "
"2642","Exodus","39","4","They made shoulder pieces for the ephod, which were attached to two of its corners, so it could be fastened.  "
"2643","Exodus","39","5","Its skillfully woven waistband was like it—of one piece with the ephod and made with gold, and with blue, purple and scarlet yarn, and with finely twisted linen, as the  Lord  commanded Moses. "
"2644","Exodus","39","6","They mounted the onyx stones in gold filigree settings and engraved them like a seal with the names of the sons of Israel.  "
"2645","Exodus","39","7","Then they fastened them on the shoulder pieces of the ephod as memorial stones for the sons of Israel, as the  Lord  commanded Moses. "
"2646","Exodus","39","8","They fashioned the breastpiece—the work of a skilled craftsman. They made it like the ephod: of gold, and of blue, purple and scarlet yarn, and of finely twisted linen.  "
"2647","Exodus","39","9","It was square—a span  long and a span wide—and folded double.  "
"2648","Exodus","39","10","Then they mounted four rows of precious stones on it. The first row was carnelian, chrysolite and beryl;  "
"2649","Exodus","39","11","the second row was turquoise, lapis lazuli and emerald;  "
"2650","Exodus","39","12","the third row was jacinth, agate and amethyst;  "
"2651","Exodus","39","13","the fourth row was topaz, onyx and jasper.  They were mounted in gold filigree settings.  "
"2652","Exodus","39","14","There were twelve stones, one for each of the names of the sons of Israel, each engraved like a seal with the name of one of the twelve tribes. "
"2653","Exodus","39","15","For the breastpiece they made braided chains of pure gold, like a rope.  "
"2654","Exodus","39","16","They made two gold filigree settings and two gold rings, and fastened the rings to two of the corners of the breastpiece.  "
"2655","Exodus","39","17","They fastened the two gold chains to the rings at the corners of the breastpiece,  "
"2656","Exodus","39","18","and the other ends of the chains to the two settings, attaching them to the shoulder pieces of the ephod at the front.  "
"2657","Exodus","39","19","They made two gold rings and attached them to the other two corners of the breastpiece on the inside edge next to the ephod.  "
"2658","Exodus","39","20","Then they made two more gold rings and attached them to the bottom of the shoulder pieces on the front of the ephod, close to the seam just above the waistband of the ephod.  "
"2659","Exodus","39","21","They tied the rings of the breastpiece to the rings of the ephod with blue cord, connecting it to the waistband so that the breastpiece would not swing out from the ephod—as the  Lord  commanded Moses. "
"2660","Exodus","39","22","They made the robe of the ephod entirely of blue cloth—the work of a weaver—  "
"2661","Exodus","39","23","with an opening in the center of the robe like the opening of a collar,  and a band around this opening, so that it would not tear.  "
"2662","Exodus","39","24","They made pomegranates of blue, purple and scarlet yarn and finely twisted linen around the hem of the robe.  "
"2663","Exodus","39","25","And they made bells of pure gold and attached them around the hem between the pomegranates.  "
"2664","Exodus","39","26","The bells and pomegranates alternated around the hem of the robe to be worn for ministering, as the  Lord  commanded Moses. "
"2665","Exodus","39","27","For Aaron and his sons, they made tunics of fine linen—the work of a weaver—  "
"2666","Exodus","39","28","and the turban of fine linen, the linen caps and the undergarments of finely twisted linen.  "
"2667","Exodus","39","29","The sash was made of finely twisted linen and blue, purple and scarlet yarn—the work of an embroiderer—as the  Lord  commanded Moses. "
"2668","Exodus","39","30","They made the plate, the sacred emblem, out of pure gold and engraved on it, like an inscription on a seal:  Holy to the  Lord .  "
"2669","Exodus","39","31","Then they fastened a blue cord to it to attach it to the turban, as the  Lord  commanded Moses. "
"2670","Exodus","39","32","So all the work on the tabernacle, the tent of meeting, was completed. The Israelites did everything just as the  Lord  commanded Moses.  "
"2671","Exodus","39","33","Then they brought the tabernacle to Moses: the tent and all its furnishings, its clasps, frames, crossbars, posts and bases;  "
"2672","Exodus","39","34","the covering of ram skins dyed red and the covering of another durable leather  and the shielding curtain;  "
"2673","Exodus","39","35","the ark of the covenant law with its poles and the atonement cover;  "
"2674","Exodus","39","36","the table with all its articles and the bread of the Presence;  "
"2675","Exodus","39","37","the pure gold lampstand with its row of lamps and all its accessories, and the olive oil for the light;  "
"2676","Exodus","39","38","the gold altar, the anointing oil, the fragrant incense, and the curtain for the entrance to the tent;  "
"2677","Exodus","39","39","the bronze altar with its bronze grating, its poles and all its utensils; the basin with its stand;  "
"2678","Exodus","39","40","the curtains of the courtyard with its posts and bases, and the curtain for the entrance to the courtyard; the ropes and tent pegs for the courtyard; all the furnishings for the tabernacle, the tent of meeting;  "
"2679","Exodus","39","41","and the woven garments worn for ministering in the sanctuary, both the sacred garments for Aaron the priest and the garments for his sons when serving as priests. "
"2680","Exodus","39","42","The Israelites had done all the work just as the  Lord  had commanded Moses.  "
"2681","Exodus","39","43","Moses inspected the work and saw that they had done it just as the  Lord  had commanded. So Moses blessed them."
"2682","Exodus","40","1","Then the  Lord  said to Moses:  "
"2683","Exodus","40","2","“Set up the tabernacle, the tent of meeting, on the first day of the first month.  "
"2684","Exodus","40","3","Place the ark of the covenant law in it and shield the ark with the curtain.  "
"2685","Exodus","40","4","Bring in the table and set out what belongs on it. Then bring in the lampstand and set up its lamps.  "
"2686","Exodus","40","5","Place the gold altar of incense in front of the ark of the covenant law and put the curtain at the entrance to the tabernacle. "
"2687","Exodus","40","6","“Place the altar of burnt offering in front of the entrance to the tabernacle, the tent of meeting;  "
"2688","Exodus","40","7","place the basin between the tent of meeting and the altar and put water in it.  "
"2689","Exodus","40","8","Set up the courtyard around it and put the curtain at the entrance to the courtyard. "
"2690","Exodus","40","9","“Take the anointing oil and anoint the tabernacle and everything in it; consecrate it and all its furnishings, and it will be holy.  "
"2691","Exodus","40","10","Then anoint the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils; consecrate the altar, and it will be most holy.  "
"2692","Exodus","40","11","Anoint the basin and its stand and consecrate them. "
"2693","Exodus","40","12","“Bring Aaron and his sons to the entrance to the tent of meeting and wash them with water.  "
"2694","Exodus","40","13","Then dress Aaron in the sacred garments, anoint him and consecrate him so he may serve me as priest.  "
"2695","Exodus","40","14","Bring his sons and dress them in tunics.  "
"2696","Exodus","40","15","Anoint them just as you anointed their father, so they may serve me as priests. Their anointing will be to a priesthood that will continue throughout their generations.”  "
"2697","Exodus","40","16","Moses did everything just as the  Lord  commanded him. "
"2698","Exodus","40","17","So the tabernacle was set up on the first day of the first month in the second year.  "
"2699","Exodus","40","18","When Moses set up the tabernacle, he put the bases in place, erected the frames, inserted the crossbars and set up the posts.  "
"2700","Exodus","40","19","Then he spread the tent over the tabernacle and put the covering over the tent, as the  Lord  commanded him. "
"2701","Exodus","40","20","He took the tablets of the covenant law and placed them in the ark, attached the poles to the ark and put the atonement cover over it.  "
"2702","Exodus","40","21","Then he brought the ark into the tabernacle and hung the shielding curtain and shielded the ark of the covenant law, as the  Lord  commanded him. "
"2703","Exodus","40","22","Moses placed the table in the tent of meeting on the north side of the tabernacle outside the curtain  "
"2704","Exodus","40","23","and set out the bread on it before the  Lord , as the  Lord  commanded him. "
"2705","Exodus","40","24","He placed the lampstand in the tent of meeting opposite the table on the south side of the tabernacle  "
"2706","Exodus","40","25","and set up the lamps before the  Lord , as the  Lord  commanded him. "
"2707","Exodus","40","26","Moses placed the gold altar in the tent of meeting in front of the curtain  "
"2708","Exodus","40","27","and burned fragrant incense on it, as the  Lord  commanded him. "
"2709","Exodus","40","28","Then he put up the curtain at the entrance to the tabernacle.  "
"2710","Exodus","40","29","He set the altar of burnt offering near the entrance to the tabernacle, the tent of meeting, and offered on it burnt offerings and grain offerings, as the  Lord  commanded him. "
"2711","Exodus","40","30","He placed the basin between the tent of meeting and the altar and put water in it for washing,  "
"2712","Exodus","40","31","and Moses and Aaron and his sons used it to wash their hands and feet.  "
"2713","Exodus","40","32","They washed whenever they entered the tent of meeting or approached the altar, as the  Lord  commanded Moses. "
"2714","Exodus","40","33","Then Moses set up the courtyard around the tabernacle and altar and put up the curtain at the entrance to the courtyard. And so Moses finished the work. "
"2715","Exodus","40","34","Then the cloud covered the tent of meeting, and the glory of the  Lord  filled the tabernacle.  "
"2716","Exodus","40","35","Moses could not enter the tent of meeting because the cloud had settled on it, and the glory of the  Lord  filled the tabernacle. "
"2717","Exodus","40","36","In all the travels of the Israelites, whenever the cloud lifted from above the tabernacle, they would set out;  "
"2718","Exodus","40","37","but if the cloud did not lift, they did not set out—until the day it lifted.  "
"2719","Exodus","40","38","So the cloud of the  Lord  was over the tabernacle by day, and fire was in the cloud by night, in the sight of all the Israelites during all their travels."
"2720","Leviticus","1","1","The  Lord  called to Moses and spoke to him from the tent of meeting. He said,  "
"2721","Leviticus","1","2","“Speak to the Israelites and say to them: ‘When anyone among you brings an offering to the  Lord , bring as your offering an animal from either the herd or the flock. "

"2736","Leviticus","1","17","He shall tear it open by the wings, not dividing it completely, and then the priest shall burn it on the wood that is burning on the altar. It is a burnt offering, a food offering, an aroma pleasing to the  Lord ."
"2737","Leviticus","2","1","“ ‘When anyone brings a grain offering to the  Lord , their offering is to be of the finest flour. They are to pour olive oil on it, put incense on it  "

"2851","Leviticus","6","28","The clay pot the meat is cooked in must be broken; but if it is cooked in a bronze pot, the pot is to be scoured and rinsed with water.  "
"2852","Leviticus","6","29","Any male in a priest’s family may eat it; it is most holy.  "
"2853","Leviticus","6","30","But any sin offering whose blood is brought into the tent of meeting to make atonement in the Holy Place must not be eaten; it must be burned up."
"2854","Leviticus","7","1","“ ‘These are the regulations for the guilt offering, which is most holy:  "
"2855","Leviticus","7","2","The guilt offering is to be slaughtered in the place where the burnt offering is slaughtered, and its blood is to be splashed against the sides of the altar.  "
"2856","Leviticus","7","3","All its fat shall be offered: the fat tail and the fat that covers the internal organs,  "
"2857","Leviticus","7","4","both kidneys with the fat on them near the loins, and the long lobe of the liver, which is to be removed with the kidneys.  "
"2858","Leviticus","7","5","The priest shall burn them on the altar as a food offering presented to the  Lord . It is a guilt offering.  "
"2859","Leviticus","7","6","Any male in a priest’s family may eat it, but it must be eaten in the sanctuary area; it is most holy. "
"2860","Leviticus","7","7","“ ‘The same law applies to both the sin offering  and the guilt offering: They belong to the priest who makes atonement with them.  "
"2861","Leviticus","7","8","The priest who offers a burnt offering for anyone may keep its hide for himself.  "
"2862","Leviticus","7","9","Every grain offering baked in an oven or cooked in a pan or on a griddle belongs to the priest who offers it,  "

"2866","Leviticus","7","13","Along with their fellowship offering of thanksgiving they are to present an offering with thick loaves of bread made with yeast.  "
"2867","Leviticus","7","14","They are to bring one of each kind as an offering, a contribution to the  Lord ; it belongs to the priest who splashes the blood of the fellowship offering against the altar.  "
"2868","Leviticus","7","15","The meat of their fellowship offering of thanksgiving must be eaten on the day it is offered; they must leave none of it till morning. "
"2869","Leviticus","7","16","“ ‘If, however, their offering is the result of a vow or is a freewill offering, the sacrifice shall be eaten on the day they offer it, but anything left over may be eaten on the next day.  "
"2870","Leviticus","7","17","Any meat of the sacrifice left over till the third day must be burned up.  "
"2871","Leviticus","7","18","If any meat of the fellowship offering is eaten on the third day, the one who offered it will not be accepted. It will not be reckoned to their credit, for it has become impure; the person who eats any of it will be held responsible. "
"2872","Leviticus","7","19","“ ‘Meat that touches anything ceremonially unclean must not be eaten; it must be burned up. As for other meat, anyone ceremonially clean may eat it.  "

"2874","Leviticus","7","21","Anyone who touches something unclean—whether human uncleanness or an unclean animal or any unclean creature that moves along the ground —and then eats any of the meat of the fellowship offering belonging to the  Lord  must be cut off from their people.’ ” "
"2875","Leviticus","7","22","The  Lord  said to Moses,  "
"2876","Leviticus","7","23","“Say to the Israelites: ‘Do not eat any of the fat of cattle, sheep or goats.  "
"2877","Leviticus","7","24","The fat of an animal found dead or torn by wild animals may be used for any other purpose, but you must not eat it.  "

"2883","Leviticus","7","30","With their own hands they are to present the food offering to the  Lord ; they are to bring the fat, together with the breast, and wave the breast before the  Lord  as a wave offering.  "
"2884","Leviticus","7","31","The priest shall burn the fat on the altar, but the breast belongs to Aaron and his sons.  "
"2885","Leviticus","7","32","You are to give the right thigh of your fellowship offerings to the priest as a contribution.  "
"2886","Leviticus","7","33","The son of Aaron who offers the blood and the fat of the fellowship offering shall have the right thigh as his share.  "
"2887","Leviticus","7","34","From the fellowship offerings of the Israelites, I have taken the breast that is waved and the thigh that is presented and have given them to Aaron the priest and his sons as their perpetual share from the Israelites.’ ” "
"2888","Leviticus","7","35","This is the portion of the food offerings presented to the  Lord  that were allotted to Aaron and his sons on the day they were presented to serve the  Lord  as priests.  "
"2889","Leviticus","7","36","On the day they were anointed, the  Lord  commanded that the Israelites give this to them as their perpetual share for the generations to come. "
"2890","Leviticus","7","37","These, then, are the regulations for the burnt offering, the grain offering, the sin offering, the guilt offering, the ordination offering and the fellowship offering,  "
"2891","Leviticus","7","38","which the  Lord  gave Moses at Mount Sinai in the Desert of Sinai on the day he commanded the Israelites to bring their offerings to the  Lord ."
"2892","Leviticus","8","1","The  Lord  said to Moses,  "
"2893","Leviticus","8","2","“Bring Aaron and his sons, their garments, the anointing oil, the bull for the sin offering,  the two rams and the basket containing bread made without yeast,  "
"2894","Leviticus","8","3","and gather the entire assembly at the entrance to the tent of meeting.”  "
"2895","Leviticus","8","4","Moses did as the  Lord  commanded him, and the assembly gathered at the entrance to the tent of meeting. "
"2896","Leviticus","8","5","Moses said to the assembly, “This is what the  Lord  has commanded to be done.”  "
"2897","Leviticus","8","6","Then Moses brought Aaron and his sons forward and washed them with water.  "
"2898","Leviticus","8","7","He put the tunic on Aaron, tied the sash around him, clothed him with the robe and put the ephod on him. He also fastened the ephod with a decorative waistband, which he tied around him.  "
"2899","Leviticus","8","8","He placed the breastpiece on him and put the Urim and Thummim in the breastpiece.  "
"2900","Leviticus","8","9","Then he placed the turban on Aaron’s head and set the gold plate, the sacred emblem, on the front of it, as the  Lord  commanded Moses. "
"2901","Leviticus","8","10","Then Moses took the anointing oil and anointed the tabernacle and everything in it, and so consecrated them.  "
"2902","Leviticus","8","11","He sprinkled some of the oil on the altar seven times, anointing the altar and all its utensils and the basin with its stand, to consecrate them.  "
"2903","Leviticus","8","12","He poured some of the anointing oil on Aaron’s head and anointed him to consecrate him.  "
"2904","Leviticus","8","13","Then he brought Aaron’s sons forward, put tunics on them, tied sashes around them and fastened caps on them, as the  Lord  commanded Moses. "
"2905","Leviticus","8","14","He then presented the bull for the sin offering, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on its head.  "
"2906","Leviticus","8","15","Moses slaughtered the bull and took some of the blood, and with his finger he put it on all the horns of the altar to purify the altar. He poured out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar. So he consecrated it to make atonement for it.  "
"2907","Leviticus","8","16","Moses also took all the fat around the internal organs, the long lobe of the liver, and both kidneys and their fat, and burned it on the altar.  "
"2908","Leviticus","8","17","But the bull with its hide and its flesh and its intestines he burned up outside the camp, as the  Lord  commanded Moses. "
"2909","Leviticus","8","18","He then presented the ram for the burnt offering, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on its head.  "
"2910","Leviticus","8","19","Then Moses slaughtered the ram and splashed the blood against the sides of the altar.  "
"2911","Leviticus","8","20","He cut the ram into pieces and burned the head, the pieces and the fat.  "
"2912","Leviticus","8","21","He washed the internal organs and the legs with water and burned the whole ram on the altar. It was a burnt offering, a pleasing aroma, a food offering presented to the  Lord , as the  Lord  commanded Moses. "
"2913","Leviticus","8","22","He then presented the other ram, the ram for the ordination, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on its head.  "
"2914","Leviticus","8","23","Moses slaughtered the ram and took some of its blood and put it on the lobe of Aaron’s right ear, on the thumb of his right hand and on the big toe of his right foot.  "
"2915","Leviticus","8","24","Moses also brought Aaron’s sons forward and put some of the blood on the lobes of their right ears, on the thumbs of their right hands and on the big toes of their right feet. Then he splashed blood against the sides of the altar.  "
"2916","Leviticus","8","25","After that, he took the fat, the fat tail, all the fat around the internal organs, the long lobe of the liver, both kidneys and their fat and the right thigh.  "
"2917","Leviticus","8","26","And from the basket of bread made without yeast, which was before the  Lord , he took one thick loaf, one thick loaf with olive oil mixed in, and one thin loaf, and he put these on the fat portions and on the right thigh.  "
"2918","Leviticus","8","27","He put all these in the hands of Aaron and his sons, and they waved them before the  Lord  as a wave offering.  "
"2919","Leviticus","8","28","Then Moses took them from their hands and burned them on the altar on top of the burnt offering as an ordination offering, a pleasing aroma, a food offering presented to the  Lord .  "
"2920","Leviticus","8","29","Moses also took the breast, which was his share of the ordination ram, and waved it before the  Lord  as a wave offering, as the  Lord  commanded Moses. "
"2921","Leviticus","8","30","Then Moses took some of the anointing oil and some of the blood from the altar and sprinkled them on Aaron and his garments and on his sons and their garments. So he consecrated Aaron and his garments and his sons and their garments. "
"2922","Leviticus","8","31","Moses then said to Aaron and his sons, “Cook the meat at the entrance to the tent of meeting and eat it there with the bread from the basket of ordination offerings, as I was commanded: ‘Aaron and his sons are to eat it.’  "
"2923","Leviticus","8","32","Then burn up the rest of the meat and the bread.  "
"2924","Leviticus","8","33","Do not leave the entrance to the tent of meeting for seven days, until the days of your ordination are completed, for your ordination will last seven days.  "
"2925","Leviticus","8","34","What has been done today was commanded by the  Lord  to make atonement for you.  "
"2926","Leviticus","8","35","You must stay at the entrance to the tent of meeting day and night for seven days and do what the  Lord  requires, so you will not die; for that is what I have been commanded.” "
"2927","Leviticus","8","36","So Aaron and his sons did everything the  Lord  commanded through Moses."
"2928","Leviticus","9","1","On the eighth day Moses summoned Aaron and his sons and the elders of Israel.  "
"2929","Leviticus","9","2","He said to Aaron, “Take a bull calf for your sin offering  and a ram for your burnt offering, both without defect, and present them before the  Lord .  "
"2930","Leviticus","9","3","Then say to the Israelites: ‘Take a male goat for a sin offering, a calf and a lamb—both a year old and without defect—for a burnt offering,  "
"2931","Leviticus","9","4","and an ox  and a ram for a fellowship offering to sacrifice before the  Lord , together with a grain offering mixed with olive oil. For today the  Lord  will appear to you.’ ” "
"2932","Leviticus","9","5","They took the things Moses commanded to the front of the tent of meeting, and the entire assembly came near and stood before the  Lord .  "
"2933","Leviticus","9","6","Then Moses said, “This is what the  Lord  has commanded you to do, so that the glory of the  Lord  may appear to you.” "
"2934","Leviticus","9","7","Moses said to Aaron, “Come to the altar and sacrifice your sin offering and your burnt offering and make atonement for yourself and the people; sacrifice the offering that is for the people and make atonement for them, as the  Lord  has commanded.” "
"2935","Leviticus","9","8","So Aaron came to the altar and slaughtered the calf as a sin offering for himself.  "
"2936","Leviticus","9","9","His sons brought the blood to him, and he dipped his finger into the blood and put it on the horns of the altar; the rest of the blood he poured out at the base of the altar.  "
"2937","Leviticus","9","10","On the altar he burned the fat, the kidneys and the long lobe of the liver from the sin offering, as the  Lord  commanded Moses;  "
"2938","Leviticus","9","11","the flesh and the hide he burned up outside the camp. "
"2939","Leviticus","9","12","Then he slaughtered the burnt offering. His sons handed him the blood, and he splashed it against the sides of the altar.  "
"2940","Leviticus","9","13","They handed him the burnt offering piece by piece, including the head, and he burned them on the altar.  "
"2941","Leviticus","9","14","He washed the internal organs and the legs and burned them on top of the burnt offering on the altar. "
"2942","Leviticus","9","15","Aaron then brought the offering that was for the people. He took the goat for the people’s sin offering and slaughtered it and offered it for a sin offering as he did with the first one. "
"2943","Leviticus","9","16","He brought the burnt offering and offered it in the prescribed way.  "
"2944","Leviticus","9","17","He also brought the grain offering, took a handful of it and burned it on the altar in addition to the morning’s burnt offering. "
"2945","Leviticus","9","18","He slaughtered the ox and the ram as the fellowship offering for the people. His sons handed him the blood, and he splashed it against the sides of the altar.  "
"2946","Leviticus","9","19","But the fat portions of the ox and the ram—the fat tail, the layer of fat, the kidneys and the long lobe of the liver—  "
"2947","Leviticus","9","20","these they laid on the breasts, and then Aaron burned the fat on the altar.  "
"2948","Leviticus","9","21","Aaron waved the breasts and the right thigh before the  Lord  as a wave offering, as Moses commanded. "
"2949","Leviticus","9","22","Then Aaron lifted his hands toward the people and blessed them. And having sacrificed the sin offering, the burnt offering and the fellowship offering, he stepped down. "
"2950","Leviticus","9","23","Moses and Aaron then went into the tent of meeting. When they came out, they blessed the people; and the glory of the  Lord  appeared to all the people.  "
"2951","Leviticus","9","24","Fire came out from the presence of the  Lord  and consumed the burnt offering and the fat portions on the altar. And when all the people saw it, they shouted for joy and fell facedown."
"2952","Leviticus","10","1","Aaron’s sons Nadab and Abihu took their censers, put fire in them and added incense; and they offered unauthorized fire before the  Lord , contrary to his command.  "
"2953","Leviticus","10","2","So fire came out from the presence of the  Lord  and consumed them, and they died before the  Lord .  "
"2954","Leviticus","10","3","Moses then said to Aaron, “This is what the  Lord  spoke of when he said: “ ‘Among those who approach me I will be proved holy; in the sight of all the people I will be honored.’ ” Aaron remained silent. "
"2955","Leviticus","10","4","Moses summoned Mishael and Elzaphan, sons of Aaron’s uncle Uzziel, and said to them, “Come here; carry your cousins outside the camp, away from the front of the sanctuary.”  "
"2956","Leviticus","10","5","So they came and carried them, still in their tunics, outside the camp, as Moses ordered. "
"2957","Leviticus","10","6","Then Moses said to Aaron and his sons Eleazar and Ithamar, “Do not let your hair become unkempt  and do not tear your clothes, or you will die and the  Lord  will be angry with the whole community. But your relatives, all the Israelites, may mourn for those the  Lord  has destroyed by fire.  "
"2958","Leviticus","10","7","Do not leave the entrance to the tent of meeting or you will die, because the  Lord ’s anointing oil is on you.” So they did as Moses said. "
"2959","Leviticus","10","8","Then the  Lord  said to Aaron,  "
"2960","Leviticus","10","9","“You and your sons are not to drink wine or other fermented drink whenever you go into the tent of meeting, or you will die. This is a lasting ordinance for the generations to come,  "
"2961","Leviticus","10","10","so that you can distinguish between the holy and the common, between the unclean and the clean,  "
"2962","Leviticus","10","11","and so you can teach the Israelites all the decrees the  Lord  has given them through Moses.” "
"2963","Leviticus","10","12","Moses said to Aaron and his remaining sons, Eleazar and Ithamar, “Take the grain offering left over from the food offerings prepared without yeast and presented to the  Lord  and eat it beside the altar, for it is most holy.  "
"2964","Leviticus","10","13","Eat it in the sanctuary area, because it is your share and your sons’ share of the food offerings presented to the  Lord ; for so I have been commanded.  "
"2965","Leviticus","10","14","But you and your sons and your daughters may eat the breast that was waved and the thigh that was presented. Eat them in a ceremonially clean place; they have been given to you and your children as your share of the Israelites’ fellowship offerings.  "
"2966","Leviticus","10","15","The thigh that was presented and the breast that was waved must be brought with the fat portions of the food offerings, to be waved before the  Lord  as a wave offering. This will be the perpetual share for you and your children, as the  Lord  has commanded.” "
"2967","Leviticus","10","16","When Moses inquired about the goat of the sin offering  and found that it had been burned up, he was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, Aaron’s remaining sons, and asked,  "
"2968","Leviticus","10","17","“Why didn’t you eat the sin offering in the sanctuary area? It is most holy; it was given to you to take away the guilt of the community by making atonement for them before the  Lord .  "
"2969","Leviticus","10","18","Since its blood was not taken into the Holy Place, you should have eaten the goat in the sanctuary area, as I commanded.” "
"2970","Leviticus","10","19","Aaron replied to Moses, “Today they sacrificed their sin offering and their burnt offering before the  Lord , but such things as this have happened to me. Would the  Lord  have been pleased if I had eaten the sin offering today?”  "
"2971","Leviticus","10","20","When Moses heard this, he was satisfied."
"2972","Leviticus","11","1","The  Lord  said to Moses and Aaron,  "
"2973","Leviticus","11","2","“Say to the Israelites: ‘Of all the animals that live on land, these are the ones you may eat:  "
"2974","Leviticus","11","3","You may eat any animal that has a divided hoof and that chews the cud. "
"2975","Leviticus","11","4","“ ‘There are some that only chew the cud or only have a divided hoof, but you must not eat them. The camel, though it chews the cud, does not have a divided hoof; it is ceremonially unclean for you.  "
"2976","Leviticus","11","5","The hyrax, though it chews the cud, does not have a divided hoof; it is unclean for you.  "
"2977","Leviticus","11","6","The rabbit, though it chews the cud, does not have a divided hoof; it is unclean for you.  "
"2978","Leviticus","11","7","And the pig, though it has a divided hoof, does not chew the cud; it is unclean for you.  "
"2979","Leviticus","11","8","You must not eat their meat or touch their carcasses; they are unclean for you. "
"2980","Leviticus","11","9","“ ‘Of all the creatures living in the water of the seas and the streams you may eat any that have fins and scales.  "
"2981","Leviticus","11","10","But all creatures in the seas or streams that do not have fins and scales—whether among all the swarming things or among all the other living creatures in the water—you are to regard as unclean.  "
"2982","Leviticus","11","11","And since you are to regard them as unclean, you must not eat their meat; you must regard their carcasses as unclean.  "

"3350","Leviticus","21","4","He must not make himself unclean for people related to him by marriage,  and so defile himself. "
"3351","Leviticus","21","5","“ ‘Priests must not shave their heads or shave off the edges of their beards or cut their bodies.  "
"3352","Leviticus","21","6","They must be holy to their God and must not profane the name of their God. Because they present the food offerings to the  Lord , the food of their God, they are to be holy. "
"3353","Leviticus","21","7","“ ‘They must not marry women defiled by prostitution or divorced from their husbands, because priests are holy to their God.  "
"3354","Leviticus","21","8","Regard them as holy, because they offer up the food of your God. Consider them holy, because I the  Lord  am holy—I who make you holy. "
"3355","Leviticus","21","9","“ ‘If a priest’s daughter defiles herself by becoming a prostitute, she disgraces her father; she must be burned in the fire. "
"3356","Leviticus","21","10","“ ‘The high priest, the one among his brothers who has had the anointing oil poured on his head and who has been ordained to wear the priestly garments, must not let his hair become unkempt  or tear his clothes.  "
"3357","Leviticus","21","11","He must not enter a place where there is a dead body. He must not make himself unclean, even for his father or mother,  "
"3358","Leviticus","21","12","nor leave the sanctuary of his God or desecrate it, because he has been dedicated by the anointing oil of his God. I am the  Lord . "
"3359","Leviticus","21","13","“ ‘The woman he marries must be a virgin.  "
"3360","Leviticus","21","14","He must not marry a widow, a divorced woman, or a woman defiled by prostitution, but only a virgin from his own people,  "
"3361","Leviticus","21","15","so that he will not defile his offspring among his people. I am the  Lord , who makes him holy.’ ” "
"3362","Leviticus","21","16","The  Lord  said to Moses,  "
"3363","Leviticus","21","17","“Say to Aaron: ‘For the generations to come none of your descendants who has a defect may come near to offer the food of his God.  "
"3364","Leviticus","21","18","No man who has any defect may come near: no man who is blind or lame, disfigured or deformed;  "
"3365","Leviticus","21","19","no man with a crippled foot or hand,  "
"3366","Leviticus","21","20","or who is a hunchback or a dwarf, or who has any eye defect, or who has festering or running sores or damaged testicles.  "
"3367","Leviticus","21","21","No descendant of Aaron the priest who has any defect is to come near to present the food offerings to the  Lord . He has a defect; he must not come near to offer the food of his God.  "
"3368","Leviticus","21","22","He may eat the most holy food of his God, as well as the holy food;  "
"3369","Leviticus","21","23","yet because of his defect, he must not go near the curtain or approach the altar, and so desecrate my sanctuary. I am the  Lord , who makes them holy.’ ” "
"3370","Leviticus","21","24","So Moses told this to Aaron and his sons and to all the Israelites."
"3371","Leviticus","22","1","The  Lord  said to Moses,  "
"3372","Leviticus","22","2","“Tell Aaron and his sons to treat with respect the sacred offerings the Israelites consecrate to me, so they will not profane my holy name. I am the  Lord . "
"3373","Leviticus","22","3","“Say to them: ‘For the generations to come, if any of your descendants is ceremonially unclean and yet comes near the sacred offerings that the Israelites consecrate to the  Lord , that person must be cut off from my presence. I am the  Lord . "
"3374","Leviticus","22","4","“ ‘If a descendant of Aaron has a defiling skin disease  or a bodily discharge, he may not eat the sacred offerings until he is cleansed. He will also be unclean if he touches something defiled by a corpse or by anyone who has an emission of semen,  "
"3375","Leviticus","22","5","or if he touches any crawling thing that makes him unclean, or any person who makes him unclean, whatever the uncleanness may be.  "
"3376","Leviticus","22","6","The one who touches any such thing will be unclean till evening. He must not eat any of the sacred offerings unless he has bathed himself with water.  "
"3377","Leviticus","22","7","When the sun goes down, he will be clean, and after that he may eat the sacred offerings, for they are his food.  "
"3378","Leviticus","22","8","He must not eat anything found dead or torn by wild animals, and so become unclean through it. I am the  Lord . "
"3379","Leviticus","22","9","“ ‘The priests are to perform my service in such a way that they do not become guilty and die for treating it with contempt. I am the  Lord , who makes them holy. "
"3380","Leviticus","22","10","“ ‘No one outside a priest’s family may eat the sacred offering, nor may the guest of a priest or his hired worker eat it.  "
"3381","Leviticus","22","11","But if a priest buys a slave with money, or if slaves are born in his household, they may eat his food.  "
"3382","Leviticus","22","12","If a priest’s daughter marries anyone other than a priest, she may not eat any of the sacred contributions.  "
"3383","Leviticus","22","13","But if a priest’s daughter becomes a widow or is divorced, yet has no children, and she returns to live in her father’s household as in her youth, she may eat her father’s food. No unauthorized person, however, may eat it. "
"3384","Leviticus","22","14","“ ‘Anyone who eats a sacred offering by mistake must make restitution to the priest for the offering and add a fifth of the value to it.  "
"3385","Leviticus","22","15","The priests must not desecrate the sacred offerings the Israelites present to the  Lord   "
"3386","Leviticus","22","16","by allowing them to eat the sacred offerings and so bring upon them guilt requiring payment. I am the  Lord , who makes them holy.’ ” "
"3387","Leviticus","22","17","The  Lord  said to Moses,  "
"3388","Leviticus","22","18","“Speak to Aaron and his sons and to all the Israelites and say to them: ‘If any of you—whether an Israelite or a foreigner residing in Israel—presents a gift for a burnt offering to the  Lord , either to fulfill a vow or as a freewill offering,  "
"3389","Leviticus","22","19","you must present a male without defect from the cattle, sheep or goats in order that it may be accepted on your behalf.  "
"3390","Leviticus","22","20","Do not bring anything with a defect, because it will not be accepted on your behalf.  "
"3391","Leviticus","22","21","When anyone brings from the herd or flock a fellowship offering to the  Lord  to fulfill a special vow or as a freewill offering, it must be without defect or blemish to be acceptable.  "
"3392","Leviticus","22","22","Do not offer to the  Lord  the blind, the injured or the maimed, or anything with warts or festering or running sores. Do not place any of these on the altar as a food offering presented to the  Lord .  "
"3393","Leviticus","22","23","You may, however, present as a freewill offering an ox  or a sheep that is deformed or stunted, but it will not be accepted in fulfillment of a vow.  "
"3394","Leviticus","22","24","You must not offer to the  Lord  an animal whose testicles are bruised, crushed, torn or cut. You must not do this in your own land,  "
"3395","Leviticus","22","25","and you must not accept such animals from the hand of a foreigner and offer them as the food of your God. They will not be accepted on your behalf, because they are deformed and have defects.’ ” "
"3396","Leviticus","22","26","The  Lord  said to Moses,  "
"3397","Leviticus","22","27","“When a calf, a lamb or a goat is born, it is to remain with its mother for seven days. From the eighth day on, it will be acceptable as a food offering presented to the  Lord .  "
"3398","Leviticus","22","28","Do not slaughter a cow or a sheep and its young on the same day. "
"3399","Leviticus","22","29","“When you sacrifice a thank offering to the  Lord , sacrifice it in such a way that it will be accepted on your behalf.  "
"3400","Leviticus","22","30","It must be eaten that same day; leave none of it till morning. I am the  Lord . "

"3404","Leviticus","23","1","The  Lord  said to Moses,  "

"3411","Leviticus","23","8","For seven days present a food offering to the  Lord . And on the seventh day hold a sacred assembly and do no regular work.’ ” "
"3412","Leviticus","23","9","The  Lord  said to Moses,  "

"3414","Leviticus","23","11","He is to wave the sheaf before the  Lord  so it will be accepted on your behalf; the priest is to wave it on the day after the Sabbath.  "
"3415","Leviticus","23","12","On the day you wave the sheaf, you must sacrifice as a burnt offering to the  Lord  a lamb a year old without defect,  "
"3416","Leviticus","23","13","together with its grain offering of two-tenths of an ephah  of the finest flour mixed with olive oil—a food offering presented to the  Lord , a pleasing aroma—and its drink offering of a quarter of a hin  of wine.  "
"3417","Leviticus","23","14","You must not eat any bread, or roasted or new grain, until the very day you bring this offering to your God. This is to be a lasting ordinance for the generations to come, wherever you live. "
"3418","Leviticus","23","15","“ ‘From the day after the Sabbath, the day you brought the sheaf of the wave offering, count off seven full weeks.  "
"3419","Leviticus","23","16","Count off fifty days up to the day after the seventh Sabbath, and then present an offering of new grain to the  Lord .  "
"3420","Leviticus","23","17","From wherever you live, bring two loaves made of two-tenths of an ephah of the finest flour, baked with yeast, as a wave offering of firstfruits to the  Lord .  "
"3421","Leviticus","23","18","Present with this bread seven male lambs, each a year old and without defect, one young bull and two rams. They will be a burnt offering to the  Lord , together with their grain offerings and drink offerings—a food offering, an aroma pleasing to the  Lord .  "
"3422","Leviticus","23","19","Then sacrifice one male goat for a sin offering  and two lambs, each a year old, for a fellowship offering.  "
"3423","Leviticus","23","20","The priest is to wave the two lambs before the  Lord  as a wave offering, together with the bread of the firstfruits. They are a sacred offering to the  Lord  for the priest.  "
"3424","Leviticus","23","21","On that same day you are to proclaim a sacred assembly and do no regular work. This is to be a lasting ordinance for the generations to come, wherever you live. "
"3425","Leviticus","23","22","“ ‘When you reap the harvest of your land, do not reap to the very edges of your field or gather the gleanings of your harvest. Leave them for the poor and for the foreigner residing among you. I am the  Lord  your God.’ ” "

"3429","Leviticus","23","26","The  Lord  said to Moses,  "

"3447","Leviticus","23","44","So Moses announced to the Israelites the appointed festivals of the  Lord ."
"3448","Leviticus","24","1","The  Lord  said to Moses,  "

"3450","Leviticus","24","3","Outside the curtain that shields the ark of the covenant law in the tent of meeting, Aaron is to tend the lamps before the  Lord  from evening till morning, continually. This is to be a lasting ordinance for the generations to come.  "
"3451","Leviticus","24","4","The lamps on the pure gold lampstand before the  Lord  must be tended continually. "
"3452","Leviticus","24","5","“Take the finest flour and bake twelve loaves of bread, using two-tenths of an ephah  for each loaf.  "
"3453","Leviticus","24","6","Arrange them in two stacks, six in each stack, on the table of pure gold before the  Lord .  "
"3454","Leviticus","24","7","By each stack put some pure incense as a memorial  portion to represent the bread and to be a food offering presented to the  Lord .  "
"3455","Leviticus","24","8","This bread is to be set out before the  Lord  regularly, Sabbath after Sabbath, on behalf of the Israelites, as a lasting covenant.  "
"3456","Leviticus","24","9","It belongs to Aaron and his sons, who are to eat it in the sanctuary area, because it is a most holy part of their perpetual share of the food offerings presented to the  Lord .” "
"3457","Leviticus","24","10","Now the son of an Israelite mother and an Egyptian father went out among the Israelites, and a fight broke out in the camp between him and an Israelite.  "
"3458","Leviticus","24","11","The son of the Israelite woman blasphemed the Name with a curse; so they brought him to Moses. (His mother’s name was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri the Danite.)  "
"3459","Leviticus","24","12","They put him in custody until the will of the  Lord  should be made clear to them. "
"3460","Leviticus","24","13","Then the  Lord  said to Moses:  "
"3461","Leviticus","24","14","“Take the blasphemer outside the camp. All those who heard him are to lay their hands on his head, and the entire assembly is to stone him.  "
"3462","Leviticus","24","15","Say to the Israelites: ‘Anyone who curses their God will be held responsible;  "
"3463","Leviticus","24","16","anyone who blasphemes the name of the  Lord  is to be put to death. The entire assembly must stone them. Whether foreigner or native-born, when they blaspheme the Name they are to be put to death. "
"3464","Leviticus","24","17","“ ‘Anyone who takes the life of a human being is to be put to death.  "
"3465","Leviticus","24","18","Anyone who takes the life of someone’s animal must make restitution—life for life.  "
"3466","Leviticus","24","19","Anyone who injures their neighbor is to be injured in the same manner:  "
"3467","Leviticus","24","20","fracture for fracture, eye for eye, tooth for tooth. The one who has inflicted the injury must suffer the same injury.  "
"3468","Leviticus","24","21","Whoever kills an animal must make restitution, but whoever kills a human being is to be put to death.  "
"3469","Leviticus","24","22","You are to have the same law for the foreigner and the native-born. I am the  Lord  your God.’ ” "
"3470","Leviticus","24","23","Then Moses spoke to the Israelites, and they took the blasphemer outside the camp and stoned him. The Israelites did as the  Lord  commanded Moses."
"3471","Leviticus","25","1","The  Lord  said to Moses at Mount Sinai,  "
"3472","Leviticus","25","2","“Speak to the Israelites and say to them: ‘When you enter the land I am going to give you, the land itself must observe a sabbath to the  Lord .  "
"3473","Leviticus","25","3","For six years sow your fields, and for six years prune your vineyards and gather their crops.  "
"3474","Leviticus","25","4","But in the seventh year the land is to have a year of sabbath rest, a sabbath to the  Lord . Do not sow your fields or prune your vineyards.  "
"3475","Leviticus","25","5","Do not reap what grows of itself or harvest the grapes of your untended vines. The land is to have a year of rest.  "
"3476","Leviticus","25","6","Whatever the land yields during the sabbath year will be food for you—for yourself, your male and female servants, and the hired worker and temporary resident who live among you,  "
"3477","Leviticus","25","7","as well as for your livestock and the wild animals in your land. Whatever the land produces may be eaten. "
"3478","Leviticus","25","8","“ ‘Count off seven sabbath years—seven times seven years—so that the seven sabbath years amount to a period of forty-nine years.  "
"3479","Leviticus","25","9","Then have the trumpet sounded everywhere on the tenth day of the seventh month; on the Day of Atonement sound the trumpet throughout your land.  "

"3481","Leviticus","25","11","The fiftieth year shall be a jubilee for you; do not sow and do not reap what grows of itself or harvest the untended vines.  "
"3482","Leviticus","25","12","For it is a jubilee and is to be holy for you; eat only what is taken directly from the fields. "
"3483","Leviticus","25","13","“ ‘In this Year of Jubilee everyone is to return to their own property. "
"3484","Leviticus","25","14","“ ‘If you sell land to any of your own people or buy land from them, do not take advantage of each other.  "
"3485","Leviticus","25","15","You are to buy from your own people on the basis of the number of years since the Jubilee. And they are to sell to you on the basis of the number of years left for harvesting crops.  "
"3486","Leviticus","25","16","When the years are many, you are to increase the price, and when the years are few, you are to decrease the price, because what is really being sold to you is the number of crops.  "
"3487","Leviticus","25","17","Do not take advantage of each other, but fear your God. I am the  Lord  your God. "
"3488","Leviticus","25","18","“ ‘Follow my decrees and be careful to obey my laws, and you will live safely in the land.  "
"3489","Leviticus","25","19","Then the land will yield its fruit, and you will eat your fill and live there in safety.  "
"3490","Leviticus","25","20","You may ask, “What will we eat in the seventh year if we do not plant or harvest our crops?”  "
"3491","Leviticus","25","21","I will send you such a blessing in the sixth year that the land will yield enough for three years.  "
"3492","Leviticus","25","22","While you plant during the eighth year, you will eat from the old crop and will continue to eat from it until the harvest of the ninth year comes in. "

"3498","Leviticus","25","28","But if they do not acquire the means to repay, what was sold will remain in the possession of the buyer until the Year of Jubilee. It will be returned in the Jubilee, and they can then go back to their property. "
"3499","Leviticus","25","29","“ ‘Anyone who sells a house in a walled city retains the right of redemption a full year after its sale. During that time the seller may redeem it.  "
"3500","Leviticus","25","30","If it is not redeemed before a full year has passed, the house in the walled city shall belong permanently to the buyer and the buyer’s descendants. It is not to be returned in the Jubilee.  "
"3501","Leviticus","25","31","But houses in villages without walls around them are to be considered as belonging to the open country. They can be redeemed, and they are to be returned in the Jubilee. "
"3502","Leviticus","25","32","“ ‘The Levites always have the right to redeem their houses in the Levitical towns, which they possess.  "
"3503","Leviticus","25","33","So the property of the Levites is redeemable—that is, a house sold in any town they hold—and is to be returned in the Jubilee, because the houses in the towns of the Levites are their property among the Israelites.  "
"3504","Leviticus","25","34","But the pastureland belonging to their towns must not be sold; it is their permanent possession. "
"3505","Leviticus","25","35","“ ‘If any of your fellow Israelites become poor and are unable to support themselves among you, help them as you would a foreigner and stranger, so they can continue to live among you.  "

"3511","Leviticus","25","41","Then they and their children are to be released, and they will go back to their own clans and to the property of their ancestors.  "
"3512","Leviticus","25","42","Because the Israelites are my servants, whom I brought out of Egypt, they must not be sold as slaves.  "

"3520","Leviticus","25","50","They and their buyer are to count the time from the year they sold themselves up to the Year of Jubilee. The price for their release is to be based on the rate paid to a hired worker for that number of years.  "

"3522","Leviticus","25","52","If only a few years remain until the Year of Jubilee, they are to compute that and pay for their redemption accordingly.  "
"3523","Leviticus","25","53","They are to be treated as workers hired from year to year; you must see to it that those to whom they owe service do not rule over them ruthlessly. "
"3524","Leviticus","25","54","“ ‘Even if someone is not redeemed in any of these ways, they and their children are to be released in the Year of Jubilee,  "
"3525","Leviticus","25","55","for the Israelites belong to me as servants. They are my servants, whom I brought out of Egypt. I am the  Lord  your God."

"3537","Leviticus","26","12","I will walk among you and be your God, and you will be my people.  "
"3538","Leviticus","26","13","I am the  Lord  your God, who brought you out of Egypt so that you would no longer be slaves to the Egyptians; I broke the bars of your yoke and enabled you to walk with heads held high. "

"3542","Leviticus","26","17","I will set my face against you so that you will be defeated by your enemies; those who hate you will rule over you, and you will flee even when no one is pursuing you. "
"3543","Leviticus","26","18","“ ‘If after all this you will not listen to me, I will punish you for your sins seven times over.  "

"3554","Leviticus","26","29","You will eat the flesh of your sons and the flesh of your daughters.  "
"3555","Leviticus","26","30","I will destroy your high places, cut down your incense altars and pile your dead bodies  on the lifeless forms of your idols, and I will abhor you.  "

"3571","Leviticus","26","46","These are the decrees, the laws and the regulations that the  Lord  established at Mount Sinai between himself and the Israelites through Moses."
"3572","Leviticus","27","1","The  Lord  said to Moses,  "
"3573","Leviticus","27","2","“Speak to the Israelites and say to them: ‘If anyone makes a special vow to dedicate a person to the  Lord  by giving the equivalent value,  "
"3574","Leviticus","27","3","set the value of a male between the ages of twenty and sixty at fifty shekels  of silver, according to the sanctuary shekel ;  "
"3575","Leviticus","27","4","for a female, set her value at thirty shekels ;  "
"3576","Leviticus","27","5","for a person between the ages of five and twenty, set the value of a male at twenty shekels  and of a female at ten shekels ;  "
"3577","Leviticus","27","6","for a person between one month and five years, set the value of a male at five shekels  of silver and that of a female at three shekels  of silver;  "
"3578","Leviticus","27","7","for a person sixty years old or more, set the value of a male at fifteen shekels  and of a female at ten shekels.  "
"3579","Leviticus","27","8","If anyone making the vow is too poor to pay the specified amount, the person being dedicated is to be presented to the priest, who will set the value according to what the one making the vow can afford. "
"3580","Leviticus","27","9","“ ‘If what they vowed is an animal that is acceptable as an offering to the  Lord , such an animal given to the  Lord  becomes holy.  "
"3581","Leviticus","27","10","They must not exchange it or substitute a good one for a bad one, or a bad one for a good one; if they should substitute one animal for another, both it and the substitute become holy.  "
"3582","Leviticus","27","11","If what they vowed is a ceremonially unclean animal—one that is not acceptable as an offering to the  Lord —the animal must be presented to the priest,  "
"3583","Leviticus","27","12","who will judge its quality as good or bad. Whatever value the priest then sets, that is what it will be.  "
"3584","Leviticus","27","13","If the owner wishes to redeem the animal, a fifth must be added to its value. "
"3585","Leviticus","27","14","“ ‘If anyone dedicates their house as something holy to the  Lord , the priest will judge its quality as good or bad. Whatever value the priest then sets, so it will remain.  "
"3586","Leviticus","27","15","If the one who dedicates their house wishes to redeem it, they must add a fifth to its value, and the house will again become theirs. "
"3587","Leviticus","27","16","“ ‘If anyone dedicates to the  Lord  part of their family land, its value is to be set according to the amount of seed required for it—fifty shekels of silver to a homer  of barley seed.  "
"3588","Leviticus","27","17","If they dedicate a field during the Year of Jubilee, the value that has been set remains.  "
"3589","Leviticus","27","18","But if they dedicate a field after the Jubilee, the priest will determine the value according to the number of years that remain until the next Year of Jubilee, and its set value will be reduced.  "
"3590","Leviticus","27","19","If the one who dedicates the field wishes to redeem it, they must add a fifth to its value, and the field will again become theirs.  "
"3591","Leviticus","27","20","If, however, they do not redeem the field, or if they have sold it to someone else, it can never be redeemed.  "
"3592","Leviticus","27","21","When the field is released in the Jubilee, it will become holy, like a field devoted to the  Lord ; it will become priestly property. "
"3593","Leviticus","27","22","“ ‘If anyone dedicates to the  Lord  a field they have bought, which is not part of their family land,  "
"3594","Leviticus","27","23","the priest will determine its value up to the Year of Jubilee, and the owner must pay its value on that day as something holy to the  Lord .  "
"3595","Leviticus","27","24","In the Year of Jubilee the field will revert to the person from whom it was bought, the one whose land it was.  "
"3596","Leviticus","27","25","Every value is to be set according to the sanctuary shekel, twenty gerahs to the shekel. "
"3597","Leviticus","27","26","“ ‘No one, however, may dedicate the firstborn of an animal, since the firstborn already belongs to the  Lord ; whether an ox  or a sheep, it is the  Lord ’s.  "
"3598","Leviticus","27","27","If it is one of the unclean animals, it may be bought back at its set value, adding a fifth of the value to it. If it is not redeemed, it is to be sold at its set value. "
"3599","Leviticus","27","28","“ ‘But nothing that a person owns and devotes  to the  Lord —whether a human being or an animal or family land—may be sold or redeemed; everything so devoted is most holy to the  Lord . "
"3600","Leviticus","27","29","“ ‘No person devoted to destruction  may be ransomed; they are to be put to death. "
"3601","Leviticus","27","30","“ ‘A tithe of everything from the land, whether grain from the soil or fruit from the trees, belongs to the  Lord ; it is holy to the  Lord .  "
"3602","Leviticus","27","31","Whoever would redeem any of their tithe must add a fifth of the value to it.  "
"3603","Leviticus","27","32","Every tithe of the herd and flock—every tenth animal that passes under the shepherd’s rod—will be holy to the  Lord .  "
"3604","Leviticus","27","33","No one may pick out the good from the bad or make any substitution. If anyone does make a substitution, both the animal and its substitute become holy and cannot be redeemed.’ ” "
"3605","Leviticus","27","34","These are the commands the  Lord  gave Moses at Mount Sinai for the Israelites."
"3606","Numbers","1","1","The  Lord  spoke to Moses in the tent of meeting in the Desert of Sinai on the first day of the second month of the second year after the Israelites came out of Egypt. He said:  "

"3796","Numbers","5","3","Send away male and female alike; send them outside the camp so they will not defile their camp, where I dwell among them.”  "
"3797","Numbers","5","4","The Israelites did so; they sent them outside the camp. They did just as the  Lord  had instructed Moses. "
"3798","Numbers","5","5","The  Lord  said to Moses,  "
"3799","Numbers","5","6","“Say to the Israelites: ‘Any man or woman who wrongs another in any way  and so is unfaithful to the  Lord  is guilty  "

"3801","Numbers","5","8","But if that person has no close relative to whom restitution can be made for the wrong, the restitution belongs to the  Lord  and must be given to the priest, along with the ram with which atonement is made for the wrongdoer.  "
"3802","Numbers","5","9","All the sacred contributions the Israelites bring to a priest will belong to him.  "
"3803","Numbers","5","10","Sacred things belong to their owners, but what they give to the priest will belong to the priest.’ ” "
"3804","Numbers","5","11","Then the  Lord  said to Moses,  "

"3806","Numbers","5","13","so that another man has sexual relations with her, and this is hidden from her husband and her impurity is undetected (since there is no witness against her and she has not been caught in the act),  "
"3807","Numbers","5","14","and if feelings of jealousy come over her husband and he suspects his wife and she is impure—or if he is jealous and suspects her even though she is not impure—  "
"3808","Numbers","5","15","then he is to take his wife to the priest. He must also take an offering of a tenth of an ephah  of barley flour on her behalf. He must not pour olive oil on it or put incense on it, because it is a grain offering for jealousy, a reminder-offering to draw attention to wrongdoing. "
"3809","Numbers","5","16","“ ‘The priest shall bring her and have her stand before the  Lord .  "
"3810","Numbers","5","17","Then he shall take some holy water in a clay jar and put some dust from the tabernacle floor into the water.  "
"3811","Numbers","5","18","After the priest has had the woman stand before the  Lord , he shall loosen her hair and place in her hands the reminder-offering, the grain offering for jealousy, while he himself holds the bitter water that brings a curse.  "
"3812","Numbers","5","19","Then the priest shall put the woman under oath and say to her, “If no other man has had sexual relations with you and you have not gone astray and become impure while married to your husband, may this bitter water that brings a curse not harm you.  "
"3813","Numbers","5","20","But if you have gone astray while married to your husband and you have made yourself impure by having sexual relations with a man other than your husband”—  "
"3814","Numbers","5","21","here the priest is to put the woman under this curse—“may the  Lord  cause you to become a curse  among your people when he makes your womb miscarry and your abdomen swell.  "
"3815","Numbers","5","22","May this water that brings a curse enter your body so that your abdomen swells or your womb miscarries.” “ ‘Then the woman is to say, “Amen. So be it.” "
"3816","Numbers","5","23","“ ‘The priest is to write these curses on a scroll and then wash them off into the bitter water.  "
"3817","Numbers","5","24","He shall make the woman drink the bitter water that brings a curse, and this water that brings a curse and causes bitter suffering will enter her.  "
"3818","Numbers","5","25","The priest is to take from her hands the grain offering for jealousy, wave it before the  Lord  and bring it to the altar.  "
"3819","Numbers","5","26","The priest is then to take a handful of the grain offering as a memorial  offering and burn it on the altar; after that, he is to have the woman drink the water.  "
"3820","Numbers","5","27","If she has made herself impure and been unfaithful to her husband, this will be the result: When she is made to drink the water that brings a curse and causes bitter suffering, it will enter her, her abdomen will swell and her womb will miscarry, and she will become a curse.  "
"3821","Numbers","5","28","If, however, the woman has not made herself impure, but is clean, she will be cleared of guilt and will be able to have children. "
"3822","Numbers","5","29","“ ‘This, then, is the law of jealousy when a woman goes astray and makes herself impure while married to her husband,  "
"3823","Numbers","5","30","or when feelings of jealousy come over a man because he suspects his wife. The priest is to have her stand before the  Lord  and is to apply this entire law to her.  "
"3824","Numbers","5","31","The husband will be innocent of any wrongdoing, but the woman will bear the consequences of her sin.’ ”"
"3825","Numbers","6","1","The  Lord  said to Moses,  "

"3827","Numbers","6","3","they must abstain from wine and other fermented drink and must not drink vinegar made from wine or other fermented drink. They must not drink grape juice or eat grapes or raisins.  "
"3828","Numbers","6","4","As long as they remain under their Nazirite vow, they must not eat anything that comes from the grapevine, not even the seeds or skins. "
"3829","Numbers","6","5","“ ‘During the entire period of their Nazirite vow, no razor may be used on their head. They must be holy until the period of their dedication to the  Lord  is over; they must let their hair grow long. "

"3831","Numbers","6","7","Even if their own father or mother or brother or sister dies, they must not make themselves ceremonially unclean on account of them, because the symbol of their dedication to God is on their head.  "
"3832","Numbers","6","8","Throughout the period of their dedication, they are consecrated to the  Lord . "
"3833","Numbers","6","9","“ ‘If someone dies suddenly in the Nazirite’s presence, thus defiling the hair that symbolizes their dedication, they must shave their head on the seventh day—the day of their cleansing.  "
"3834","Numbers","6","10","Then on the eighth day they must bring two doves or two young pigeons to the priest at the entrance to the tent of meeting.  "
"3835","Numbers","6","11","The priest is to offer one as a sin offering  and the other as a burnt offering to make atonement for the Nazirite because they sinned by being in the presence of the dead body. That same day they are to consecrate their head again.  "
"3836","Numbers","6","12","They must rededicate themselves to the  Lord  for the same period of dedication and must bring a year-old male lamb as a guilt offering. The previous days do not count, because they became defiled during their period of dedication. "
"3837","Numbers","6","13","“ ‘Now this is the law of the Nazirite when the period of their dedication is over. They are to be brought to the entrance to the tent of meeting.  "
"3838","Numbers","6","14","There they are to present their offerings to the  Lord : a year-old male lamb without defect for a burnt offering, a year-old ewe lamb without defect for a sin offering, a ram without defect for a fellowship offering,  "
"3839","Numbers","6","15","together with their grain offerings and drink offerings, and a basket of bread made with the finest flour and without yeast—thick loaves with olive oil mixed in, and thin loaves brushed with olive oil. "
"3840","Numbers","6","16","“ ‘The priest is to present all these before the  Lord  and make the sin offering and the burnt offering.  "
"3841","Numbers","6","17","He is to present the basket of unleavened bread and is to sacrifice the ram as a fellowship offering to the  Lord , together with its grain offering and drink offering. "
"3842","Numbers","6","18","“ ‘Then at the entrance to the tent of meeting, the Nazirite must shave off the hair that symbolizes their dedication. They are to take the hair and put it in the fire that is under the sacrifice of the fellowship offering. "
"3843","Numbers","6","19","“ ‘After the Nazirite has shaved off the hair that symbolizes their dedication, the priest is to place in their hands a boiled shoulder of the ram, and one thick loaf and one thin loaf from the basket, both made without yeast.  "
"3844","Numbers","6","20","The priest shall then wave these before the  Lord  as a wave offering; they are holy and belong to the priest, together with the breast that was waved and the thigh that was presented. After that, the Nazirite may drink wine. "
"3845","Numbers","6","21","“ ‘This is the law of the Nazirite who vows offerings to the  Lord  in accordance with their dedication, in addition to whatever else they can afford. They must fulfill the vows they have made, according to the law of the Nazirite.’ ” "
"3846","Numbers","6","22","The  Lord  said to Moses,  "
"3847","Numbers","6","23","“Tell Aaron and his sons, ‘This is how you are to bless the Israelites. Say to them: "

"3852","Numbers","7","1","When Moses finished setting up the tabernacle, he anointed and consecrated it and all its furnishings. He also anointed and consecrated the altar and all its utensils.  "
"3853","Numbers","7","2","Then the leaders of Israel, the heads of families who were the tribal leaders in charge of those who were counted, made offerings.  "
"3854","Numbers","7","3","They brought as their gifts before the  Lord  six covered carts and twelve oxen—an ox from each leader and a cart from every two. These they presented before the tabernacle. "
"3855","Numbers","7","4","The  Lord  said to Moses,  "
"3856","Numbers","7","5","“Accept these from them, that they may be used in the work at the tent of meeting. Give them to the Levites as each man’s work requires.” "

"3860","Numbers","7","9","But Moses did not give any to the Kohathites, because they were to carry on their shoulders the holy things, for which they were responsible. "
"3861","Numbers","7","10","When the altar was anointed, the leaders brought their offerings for its dedication and presented them before the altar.  "
"3862","Numbers","7","11","For the  Lord  had said to Moses, “Each day one leader is to bring his offering for the dedication of the altar.” "
"3863","Numbers","7","12","The one who brought his offering on the first day was Nahshon son of Amminadab of the tribe of Judah. "

"3940","Numbers","7","89","When Moses entered the tent of meeting to speak with the  Lord , he heard the voice speaking to him from between the two cherubim above the atonement cover on the ark of the covenant law. In this way the  Lord  spoke to him."
"3941","Numbers","8","1","The  Lord  said to Moses,  "
"3942","Numbers","8","2","“Speak to Aaron and say to him, ‘When you set up the lamps, see that all seven light up the area in front of the lampstand.’ ” "
"3943","Numbers","8","3","Aaron did so; he set up the lamps so that they faced forward on the lampstand, just as the  Lord  commanded Moses.  "
"3944","Numbers","8","4","This is how the lampstand was made: It was made of hammered gold—from its base to its blossoms. The lampstand was made exactly like the pattern the  Lord  had shown Moses. "
"3945","Numbers","8","5","The  Lord  said to Moses:  "
"3946","Numbers","8","6","“Take the Levites from among all the Israelites and make them ceremonially clean.  "
"3947","Numbers","8","7","To purify them, do this: Sprinkle the water of cleansing on them; then have them shave their whole bodies and wash their clothes. And so they will purify themselves.  "
"3948","Numbers","8","8","Have them take a young bull with its grain offering of the finest flour mixed with olive oil; then you are to take a second young bull for a sin offering.   "
"3949","Numbers","8","9","Bring the Levites to the front of the tent of meeting and assemble the whole Israelite community.  "
"3950","Numbers","8","10","You are to bring the Levites before the  Lord , and the Israelites are to lay their hands on them.  "
"3951","Numbers","8","11","Aaron is to present the Levites before the  Lord  as a wave offering from the Israelites, so that they may be ready to do the work of the  Lord . "
"3952","Numbers","8","12","“Then the Levites are to lay their hands on the heads of the bulls, using one for a sin offering to the  Lord  and the other for a burnt offering, to make atonement for the Levites.  "
"3953","Numbers","8","13","Have the Levites stand in front of Aaron and his sons and then present them as a wave offering to the  Lord .  "
"3954","Numbers","8","14","In this way you are to set the Levites apart from the other Israelites, and the Levites will be mine. "
"3955","Numbers","8","15","“After you have purified the Levites and presented them as a wave offering, they are to come to do their work at the tent of meeting.  "
"3956","Numbers","8","16","They are the Israelites who are to be given wholly to me. I have taken them as my own in place of the firstborn, the first male offspring from every Israelite woman.  "
"3957","Numbers","8","17","Every firstborn male in Israel, whether human or animal, is mine. When I struck down all the firstborn in Egypt, I set them apart for myself.  "
"3958","Numbers","8","18","And I have taken the Levites in place of all the firstborn sons in Israel.  "
"3959","Numbers","8","19","From among all the Israelites, I have given the Levites as gifts to Aaron and his sons to do the work at the tent of meeting on behalf of the Israelites and to make atonement for them so that no plague will strike the Israelites when they go near the sanctuary.” "
"3960","Numbers","8","20","Moses, Aaron and the whole Israelite community did with the Levites just as the  Lord  commanded Moses.  "
"3961","Numbers","8","21","The Levites purified themselves and washed their clothes. Then Aaron presented them as a wave offering before the  Lord  and made atonement for them to purify them.  "
"3962","Numbers","8","22","After that, the Levites came to do their work at the tent of meeting under the supervision of Aaron and his sons. They did with the Levites just as the  Lord  commanded Moses. "
"3963","Numbers","8","23","The  Lord  said to Moses,  "
"3964","Numbers","8","24","“This applies to the Levites: Men twenty-five years old or more shall come to take part in the work at the tent of meeting,  "
"3965","Numbers","8","25","but at the age of fifty, they must retire from their regular service and work no longer.  "
"3966","Numbers","8","26","They may assist their brothers in performing their duties at the tent of meeting, but they themselves must not do the work. This, then, is how you are to assign the responsibilities of the Levites.”"
"3967","Numbers","9","1","The  Lord  spoke to Moses in the Desert of Sinai in the first month of the second year after they came out of Egypt. He said,  "
"3968","Numbers","9","2","“Have the Israelites celebrate the Passover at the appointed time.  "
"3969","Numbers","9","3","Celebrate it at the appointed time, at twilight on the fourteenth day of this month, in accordance with all its rules and regulations.” "
"3970","Numbers","9","4","So Moses told the Israelites to celebrate the Passover,  "
"3971","Numbers","9","5","and they did so in the Desert of Sinai at twilight on the fourteenth day of the first month. The Israelites did everything just as the  Lord  commanded Moses. "
"3972","Numbers","9","6","But some of them could not celebrate the Passover on that day because they were ceremonially unclean on account of a dead body. So they came to Moses and Aaron that same day  "
"3973","Numbers","9","7","and said to Moses, “We have become unclean because of a dead body, but why should we be kept from presenting the  Lord ’s offering with the other Israelites at the appointed time?” "
"3974","Numbers","9","8","Moses answered them, “Wait until I find out what the  Lord  commands concerning you.” "
"3975","Numbers","9","9","Then the  Lord  said to Moses,  "
"3976","Numbers","9","10","“Tell the Israelites: ‘When any of you or your descendants are unclean because of a dead body or are away on a journey, they are still to celebrate the  Lord ’s Passover,  "
"3977","Numbers","9","11","but they are to do it on the fourteenth day of the second month at twilight. They are to eat the lamb, together with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.  "
"3978","Numbers","9","12","They must not leave any of it till morning or break any of its bones. When they celebrate the Passover, they must follow all the regulations.  "
"3979","Numbers","9","13","But if anyone who is ceremonially clean and not on a journey fails to celebrate the Passover, they must be cut off from their people for not presenting the  Lord ’s offering at the appointed time. They will bear the consequences of their sin. "
"3980","Numbers","9","14","“ ‘A foreigner residing among you is also to celebrate the  Lord ’s Passover in accordance with its rules and regulations. You must have the same regulations for both the foreigner and the native-born.’ ” "
"3981","Numbers","9","15","On the day the tabernacle, the tent of the covenant law, was set up, the cloud covered it. From evening till morning the cloud above the tabernacle looked like fire.  "
"3982","Numbers","9","16","That is how it continued to be; the cloud covered it, and at night it looked like fire.  "
"3983","Numbers","9","17","Whenever the cloud lifted from above the tent, the Israelites set out; wherever the cloud settled, the Israelites encamped.  "
"3984","Numbers","9","18","At the  Lord ’s command the Israelites set out, and at his command they encamped. As long as the cloud stayed over the tabernacle, they remained in camp.  "
"3985","Numbers","9","19","When the cloud remained over the tabernacle a long time, the Israelites obeyed the  Lord ’s order and did not set out.  "
"3986","Numbers","9","20","Sometimes the cloud was over the tabernacle only a few days; at the  Lord ’s command they would encamp, and then at his command they would set out.  "
"3987","Numbers","9","21","Sometimes the cloud stayed only from evening till morning, and when it lifted in the morning, they set out. Whether by day or by night, whenever the cloud lifted, they set out.  "
"3988","Numbers","9","22","Whether the cloud stayed over the tabernacle for two days or a month or a year, the Israelites would remain in camp and not set out; but when it lifted, they would set out.  "
"3989","Numbers","9","23","At the  Lord ’s command they encamped, and at the  Lord ’s command they set out. They obeyed the  Lord ’s order, in accordance with his command through Moses."
"3990","Numbers","10","1","The  Lord  said to Moses:  "
"3991","Numbers","10","2","“Make two trumpets of hammered silver, and use them for calling the community together and for having the camps set out.  "
"3992","Numbers","10","3","When both are sounded, the whole community is to assemble before you at the entrance to the tent of meeting.  "
"3993","Numbers","10","4","If only one is sounded, the leaders—the heads of the clans of Israel—are to assemble before you.  "
"3994","Numbers","10","5","When a trumpet blast is sounded, the tribes camping on the east are to set out.  "
"3995","Numbers","10","6","At the sounding of a second blast, the camps on the south are to set out. The blast will be the signal for setting out.  "
"3996","Numbers","10","7","To gather the assembly, blow the trumpets, but not with the signal for setting out. "
"3997","Numbers","10","8","“The sons of Aaron, the priests, are to blow the trumpets. This is to be a lasting ordinance for you and the generations to come.  "
"3998","Numbers","10","9","When you go into battle in your own land against an enemy who is oppressing you, sound a blast on the trumpets. Then you will be remembered by the  Lord  your God and rescued from your enemies.  "
"3999","Numbers","10","10","Also at your times of rejoicing—your appointed festivals and New Moon feasts—you are to sound the trumpets over your burnt offerings and fellowship offerings, and they will be a memorial for you before your God. I am the  Lord  your God.” "
"4000","Numbers","10","11","On the twentieth day of the second month of the second year, the cloud lifted from above the tabernacle of the covenant law.  "
"4001","Numbers","10","12","Then the Israelites set out from the Desert of Sinai and traveled from place to place until the cloud came to rest in the Desert of Paran.  "
"4002","Numbers","10","13","They set out, this first time, at the  Lord ’s command through Moses. "
"4003","Numbers","10","14","The divisions of the camp of Judah went first, under their standard. Nahshon son of Amminadab was in command.  "
"4004","Numbers","10","15","Nethanel son of Zuar was over the division of the tribe of Issachar,  "
"4005","Numbers","10","16","and Eliab son of Helon was over the division of the tribe of Zebulun.  "
"4006","Numbers","10","17","Then the tabernacle was taken down, and the Gershonites and Merarites, who carried it, set out. "
"4007","Numbers","10","18","The divisions of the camp of Reuben went next, under their standard. Elizur son of Shedeur was in command.  "
"4008","Numbers","10","19","Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai was over the division of the tribe of Simeon,  "
"4009","Numbers","10","20","and Eliasaph son of Deuel was over the division of the tribe of Gad.  "
"4010","Numbers","10","21","Then the Kohathites set out, carrying the holy things. The tabernacle was to be set up before they arrived. "
"4011","Numbers","10","22","The divisions of the camp of Ephraim went next, under their standard. Elishama son of Ammihud was in command.  "
"4012","Numbers","10","23","Gamaliel son of Pedahzur was over the division of the tribe of Manasseh,  "
"4013","Numbers","10","24","and Abidan son of Gideoni was over the division of the tribe of Benjamin. "
"4014","Numbers","10","25","Finally, as the rear guard for all the units, the divisions of the camp of Dan set out under their standard. Ahiezer son of Ammishaddai was in command.  "
"4015","Numbers","10","26","Pagiel son of Okran was over the division of the tribe of Asher,  "
"4016","Numbers","10","27","and Ahira son of Enan was over the division of the tribe of Naphtali.  "
"4017","Numbers","10","28","This was the order of march for the Israelite divisions as they set out. "
"4018","Numbers","10","29","Now Moses said to Hobab son of Reuel the Midianite, Moses’ father-in-law, “We are setting out for the place about which the  Lord  said, ‘I will give it to you.’ Come with us and we will treat you well, for the  Lord  has promised good things to Israel.” "
"4019","Numbers","10","30","He answered, “No, I will not go; I am going back to my own land and my own people.” "
"4020","Numbers","10","31","But Moses said, “Please do not leave us. You know where we should camp in the wilderness, and you can be our eyes.  "
"4021","Numbers","10","32","If you come with us, we will share with you whatever good things the  Lord  gives us.” "
"4022","Numbers","10","33","So they set out from the mountain of the  Lord  and traveled for three days. The ark of the covenant of the  Lord  went before them during those three days to find them a place to rest.  "
"4023","Numbers","10","34","The cloud of the  Lord  was over them by day when they set out from the camp. "
"4024","Numbers","10","35","Whenever the ark set out, Moses said, “Rise up,  Lord ! May your enemies be scattered; may your foes flee before you.” "
"4025","Numbers","10","36","Whenever it came to rest, he said, “Return,  Lord , to the countless thousands of Israel.”"
"4026","Numbers","11","1","Now the people complained about their hardships in the hearing of the  Lord , and when he heard them his anger was aroused. Then fire from the  Lord  burned among them and consumed some of the outskirts of the camp.  "
"4027","Numbers","11","2","When the people cried out to Moses, he prayed to the  Lord  and the fire died down.  "
"4028","Numbers","11","3","So that place was called Taberah,  because fire from the  Lord  had burned among them. "
"4029","Numbers","11","4","The rabble with them began to crave other food, and again the Israelites started wailing and said, “If only we had meat to eat!  "
"4030","Numbers","11","5","We remember the fish we ate in Egypt at no cost—also the cucumbers, melons, leeks, onions and garlic.  "
"4031","Numbers","11","6","But now we have lost our appetite; we never see anything but this manna!” "
"4032","Numbers","11","7","The manna was like coriander seed and looked like resin.  "
"4033","Numbers","11","8","The people went around gathering it, and then ground it in a hand mill or crushed it in a mortar. They cooked it in a pot or made it into loaves. And it tasted like something made with olive oil.  "
"4034","Numbers","11","9","When the dew settled on the camp at night, the manna also came down. "
"4035","Numbers","11","10","Moses heard the people of every family wailing at the entrance to their tents. The  Lord  became exceedingly angry, and Moses was troubled.  "
"4036","Numbers","11","11","He asked the  Lord , “Why have you brought this trouble on your servant? What have I done to displease you that you put the burden of all these people on me?  "
"4037","Numbers","11","12","Did I conceive all these people? Did I give them birth? Why do you tell me to carry them in my arms, as a nurse carries an infant, to the land you promised on oath to their ancestors?  "
"4038","Numbers","11","13","Where can I get meat for all these people? They keep wailing to me, ‘Give us meat to eat!’  "
"4039","Numbers","11","14","I cannot carry all these people by myself; the burden is too heavy for me.  "
"4040","Numbers","11","15","If this is how you are going to treat me, please go ahead and kill me—if I have found favor in your eyes—and do not let me face my own ruin.” "
"4041","Numbers","11","16","The  Lord  said to Moses: “Bring me seventy of Israel’s elders who are known to you as leaders and officials among the people. Have them come to the tent of meeting, that they may stand there with you.  "
"4042","Numbers","11","17","I will come down and speak with you there, and I will take some of the power of the Spirit that is on you and put it on them. They will share the burden of the people with you so that you will not have to carry it alone. "
"4043","Numbers","11","18","“Tell the people: ‘Consecrate yourselves in preparation for tomorrow, when you will eat meat. The  Lord  heard you when you wailed, “If only we had meat to eat! We were better off in Egypt!” Now the  Lord  will give you meat, and you will eat it.  "
"4044","Numbers","11","19","You will not eat it for just one day, or two days, or five, ten or twenty days,  "
"4045","Numbers","11","20","but for a whole month—until it comes out of your nostrils and you loathe it—because you have rejected the  Lord , who is among you, and have wailed before him, saying, “Why did we ever leave Egypt?” ’ ” "
"4046","Numbers","11","21","But Moses said, “Here I am among six hundred thousand men on foot, and you say, ‘I will give them meat to eat for a whole month!’  "
"4047","Numbers","11","22","Would they have enough if flocks and herds were slaughtered for them? Would they have enough if all the fish in the sea were caught for them?” "
"4048","Numbers","11","23","The  Lord  answered Moses, “Is the  Lord ’s arm too short? Now you will see whether or not what I say will come true for you.” "
"4049","Numbers","11","24","So Moses went out and told the people what the  Lord  had said. He brought together seventy of their elders and had them stand around the tent.  "
"4050","Numbers","11","25","Then the  Lord  came down in the cloud and spoke with him, and he took some of the power of the Spirit that was on him and put it on the seventy elders. When the Spirit rested on them, they prophesied—but did not do so again. "
"4051","Numbers","11","26","However, two men, whose names were Eldad and Medad, had remained in the camp. They were listed among the elders, but did not go out to the tent. Yet the Spirit also rested on them, and they prophesied in the camp.  "
"4052","Numbers","11","27","A young man ran and told Moses, “Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp.” "
"4053","Numbers","11","28","Joshua son of Nun, who had been Moses’ aide since youth, spoke up and said, “Moses, my lord, stop them!” "
"4054","Numbers","11","29","But Moses replied, “Are you jealous for my sake? I wish that all the  Lord ’s people were prophets and that the  Lord  would put his Spirit on them!”  "
"4055","Numbers","11","30","Then Moses and the elders of Israel returned to the camp. "
"4056","Numbers","11","31","Now a wind went out from the  Lord  and drove quail in from the sea. It scattered them up to two cubits  deep all around the camp, as far as a day’s walk in any direction.  "
"4057","Numbers","11","32","All that day and night and all the next day the people went out and gathered quail. No one gathered less than ten homers.  Then they spread them out all around the camp.  "
"4058","Numbers","11","33","But while the meat was still between their teeth and before it could be consumed, the anger of the  Lord  burned against the people, and he struck them with a severe plague.  "
"4059","Numbers","11","34","Therefore the place was named Kibroth Hattaavah,  because there they buried the people who had craved other food. "
"4060","Numbers","11","35","From Kibroth Hattaavah the people traveled to Hazeroth and stayed there."
"4061","Numbers","12","1","Miriam and Aaron began to talk against Moses because of his Cushite wife, for he had married a Cushite.  "
"4062","Numbers","12","2","“Has the  Lord  spoken only through Moses?” they asked. “Hasn’t he also spoken through us?” And the  Lord  heard this. "
"4063","Numbers","12","3","(Now Moses was a very humble man, more humble than anyone else on the face of the earth.) "
"4064","Numbers","12","4","At once the  Lord  said to Moses, Aaron and Miriam, “Come out to the tent of meeting, all three of you.” So the three of them went out.  "
"4065","Numbers","12","5","Then the  Lord  came down in a pillar of cloud; he stood at the entrance to the tent and summoned Aaron and Miriam. When the two of them stepped forward,  "
"4066","Numbers","12","6","he said, “Listen to my words: “When there is a prophet among you, I, the  Lord , reveal myself to them in visions, I speak to them in dreams. "
"4067","Numbers","12","7","But this is not true of my servant Moses; he is faithful in all my house. "
"4068","Numbers","12","8","With him I speak face to face, clearly and not in riddles; he sees the form of the  Lord . Why then were you not afraid to speak against my servant Moses?” "
"4069","Numbers","12","9","The anger of the  Lord  burned against them, and he left them. "
"4070","Numbers","12","10","When the cloud lifted from above the tent, Miriam’s skin was leprous —it became as white as snow. Aaron turned toward her and saw that she had a defiling skin disease,  "
"4071","Numbers","12","11","and he said to Moses, “Please, my lord, I ask you not to hold against us the sin we have so foolishly committed.  "
"4072","Numbers","12","12","Do not let her be like a stillborn infant coming from its mother’s womb with its flesh half eaten away.” "
"4073","Numbers","12","13","So Moses cried out to the  Lord , “Please, God, heal her!” "
"4074","Numbers","12","14","The  Lord  replied to Moses, “If her father had spit in her face, would she not have been in disgrace for seven days? Confine her outside the camp for seven days; after that she can be brought back.”  "
"4075","Numbers","12","15","So Miriam was confined outside the camp for seven days, and the people did not move on till she was brought back. "
"4076","Numbers","12","16","After that, the people left Hazeroth and encamped in the Desert of Paran."
"4077","Numbers","13","1","The  Lord  said to Moses,  "
"4078","Numbers","13","2","“Send some men to explore the land of Canaan, which I am giving to the Israelites. From each ancestral tribe send one of its leaders.” "
"4079","Numbers","13","3","So at the  Lord ’s command Moses sent them out from the Desert of Paran. All of them were leaders of the Israelites.  "
"4080","Numbers","13","4","These are their names: from the tribe of Reuben, Shammua son of Zakkur; "
"4081","Numbers","13","5","from the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat son of Hori; "
"4082","Numbers","13","6","from the tribe of Judah, Caleb son of Jephunneh; "
"4083","Numbers","13","7","from the tribe of Issachar, Igal son of Joseph; "
"4084","Numbers","13","8","from the tribe of Ephraim, Hoshea son of Nun; "
"4085","Numbers","13","9","from the tribe of Benjamin, Palti son of Raphu; "
"4086","Numbers","13","10","from the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel son of Sodi; "
"4087","Numbers","13","11","from the tribe of Manasseh (a tribe of Joseph), Gaddi son of Susi; "
"4088","Numbers","13","12","from the tribe of Dan, Ammiel son of Gemalli; "
"4089","Numbers","13","13","from the tribe of Asher, Sethur son of Michael; "
"4090","Numbers","13","14","from the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi son of Vophsi; "
"4091","Numbers","13","15","from the tribe of Gad, Geuel son of Maki. "
"4092","Numbers","13","16","These are the names of the men Moses sent to explore the land. (Moses gave Hoshea son of Nun the name Joshua.) "
"4093","Numbers","13","17","When Moses sent them to explore Canaan, he said, “Go up through the Negev and on into the hill country.  "
"4094","Numbers","13","18","See what the land is like and whether the people who live there are strong or weak, few or many.  "
"4095","Numbers","13","19","What kind of land do they live in? Is it good or bad? What kind of towns do they live in? Are they unwalled or fortified?  "
"4096","Numbers","13","20","How is the soil? Is it fertile or poor? Are there trees in it or not? Do your best to bring back some of the fruit of the land.” (It was the season for the first ripe grapes.) "
"4097","Numbers","13","21","So they went up and explored the land from the Desert of Zin as far as Rehob, toward Lebo Hamath.  "
"4098","Numbers","13","22","They went up through the Negev and came to Hebron, where Ahiman, Sheshai and Talmai, the descendants of Anak, lived. (Hebron had been built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)  "
"4099","Numbers","13","23","When they reached the Valley of Eshkol,  they cut off a branch bearing a single cluster of grapes. Two of them carried it on a pole between them, along with some pomegranates and figs.  "
"4100","Numbers","13","24","That place was called the Valley of Eshkol because of the cluster of grapes the Israelites cut off there.  "
"4101","Numbers","13","25","At the end of forty days they returned from exploring the land. "
"4102","Numbers","13","26","They came back to Moses and Aaron and the whole Israelite community at Kadesh in the Desert of Paran. There they reported to them and to the whole assembly and showed them the fruit of the land.  "
"4103","Numbers","13","27","They gave Moses this account: “We went into the land to which you sent us, and it does flow with milk and honey! Here is its fruit.  "
"4104","Numbers","13","28","But the people who live there are powerful, and the cities are fortified and very large. We even saw descendants of Anak there.  "
"4105","Numbers","13","29","The Amalekites live in the Negev; the Hittites, Jebusites and Amorites live in the hill country; and the Canaanites live near the sea and along the Jordan.” "
"4106","Numbers","13","30","Then Caleb silenced the people before Moses and said, “We should go up and take possession of the land, for we can certainly do it.” "
"4107","Numbers","13","31","But the men who had gone up with him said, “We can’t attack those people; they are stronger than we are.”  "
"4108","Numbers","13","32","And they spread among the Israelites a bad report about the land they had explored. They said, “The land we explored devours those living in it. All the people we saw there are of great size.  "
"4109","Numbers","13","33","We saw the Nephilim there (the descendants of Anak come from the Nephilim). We seemed like grasshoppers in our own eyes, and we looked the same to them.”"
"4110","Numbers","14","1","That night all the members of the community raised their voices and wept aloud.  "
"4111","Numbers","14","2","All the Israelites grumbled against Moses and Aaron, and the whole assembly said to them, “If only we had died in Egypt! Or in this wilderness!  "
"4112","Numbers","14","3","Why is the  Lord  bringing us to this land only to let us fall by the sword? Our wives and children will be taken as plunder. Wouldn’t it be better for us to go back to Egypt?”  "
"4113","Numbers","14","4","And they said to each other, “We should choose a leader and go back to Egypt.” "
"4114","Numbers","14","5","Then Moses and Aaron fell facedown in front of the whole Israelite assembly gathered there.  "
"4115","Numbers","14","6","Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of Jephunneh, who were among those who had explored the land, tore their clothes  "
"4116","Numbers","14","7","and said to the entire Israelite assembly, “The land we passed through and explored is exceedingly good.  "
"4117","Numbers","14","8","If the  Lord  is pleased with us, he will lead us into that land, a land flowing with milk and honey, and will give it to us.  "
"4118","Numbers","14","9","Only do not rebel against the  Lord . And do not be afraid of the people of the land, because we will devour them. Their protection is gone, but the  Lord  is with us. Do not be afraid of them.” "
"4119","Numbers","14","10","But the whole assembly talked about stoning them. Then the glory of the  Lord  appeared at the tent of meeting to all the Israelites.  "
"4120","Numbers","14","11","The  Lord  said to Moses, “How long will these people treat me with contempt? How long will they refuse to believe in me, in spite of all the signs I have performed among them?  "
"4121","Numbers","14","12","I will strike them down with a plague and destroy them, but I will make you into a nation greater and stronger than they.” "
"4122","Numbers","14","13","Moses said to the  Lord , “Then the Egyptians will hear about it! By your power you brought these people up from among them.  "
"4123","Numbers","14","14","And they will tell the inhabitants of this land about it. They have already heard that you,  Lord , are with these people and that you,  Lord , have been seen face to face, that your cloud stays over them, and that you go before them in a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night.  "
"4124","Numbers","14","15","If you put all these people to death, leaving none alive, the nations who have heard this report about you will say,  "
"4125","Numbers","14","16","‘The  Lord  was not able to bring these people into the land he promised them on oath, so he slaughtered them in the wilderness.’ "
"4126","Numbers","14","17","“Now may the Lord’s strength be displayed, just as you have declared:  "
"4127","Numbers","14","18","‘The  Lord  is slow to anger, abounding in love and forgiving sin and rebellion. Yet he does not leave the guilty unpunished; he punishes the children for the sin of the parents to the third and fourth generation.’  "
"4128","Numbers","14","19","In accordance with your great love, forgive the sin of these people, just as you have pardoned them from the time they left Egypt until now.” "
"4129","Numbers","14","20","The  Lord  replied, “I have forgiven them, as you asked.  "
"4130","Numbers","14","21","Nevertheless, as surely as I live and as surely as the glory of the  Lord  fills the whole earth,  "
"4131","Numbers","14","22","not one of those who saw my glory and the signs I performed in Egypt and in the wilderness but who disobeyed me and tested me ten times—  "
"4132","Numbers","14","23","not one of them will ever see the land I promised on oath to their ancestors. No one who has treated me with contempt will ever see it.  "
"4133","Numbers","14","24","But because my servant Caleb has a different spirit and follows me wholeheartedly, I will bring him into the land he went to, and his descendants will inherit it.  "
"4134","Numbers","14","25","Since the Amalekites and the Canaanites are living in the valleys, turn back tomorrow and set out toward the desert along the route to the Red Sea. ” "
"4135","Numbers","14","26","The  Lord  said to Moses and Aaron:  "
"4136","Numbers","14","27","“How long will this wicked community grumble against me? I have heard the complaints of these grumbling Israelites.  "
"4137","Numbers","14","28","So tell them, ‘As surely as I live, declares the  Lord , I will do to you the very thing I heard you say:  "
"4138","Numbers","14","29","In this wilderness your bodies will fall—every one of you twenty years old or more who was counted in the census and who has grumbled against me.  "
"4139","Numbers","14","30","Not one of you will enter the land I swore with uplifted hand to make your home, except Caleb son of Jephunneh and Joshua son of Nun.  "
"4140","Numbers","14","31","As for your children that you said would be taken as plunder, I will bring them in to enjoy the land you have rejected.  "
"4141","Numbers","14","32","But as for you, your bodies will fall in this wilderness.  "
"4142","Numbers","14","33","Your children will be shepherds here for forty years, suffering for your unfaithfulness, until the last of your bodies lies in the wilderness.  "
"4143","Numbers","14","34","For forty years—one year for each of the forty days you explored the land—you will suffer for your sins and know what it is like to have me against you.’  "
"4144","Numbers","14","35","I, the  Lord , have spoken, and I will surely do these things to this whole wicked community, which has banded together against me. They will meet their end in this wilderness; here they will die.” "
"4145","Numbers","14","36","So the men Moses had sent to explore the land, who returned and made the whole community grumble against him by spreading a bad report about it—  "
"4146","Numbers","14","37","these men who were responsible for spreading the bad report about the land were struck down and died of a plague before the  Lord .  "
"4147","Numbers","14","38","Of the men who went to explore the land, only Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of Jephunneh survived. "
"4148","Numbers","14","39","When Moses reported this to all the Israelites, they mourned bitterly.  "
"4149","Numbers","14","40","Early the next morning they set out for the highest point in the hill country, saying, “Now we are ready to go up to the land the  Lord  promised. Surely we have sinned!” "
"4150","Numbers","14","41","But Moses said, “Why are you disobeying the  Lord ’s command? This will not succeed!  "
"4151","Numbers","14","42","Do not go up, because the  Lord  is not with you. You will be defeated by your enemies,  "
"4152","Numbers","14","43","for the Amalekites and the Canaanites will face you there. Because you have turned away from the  Lord , he will not be with you and you will fall by the sword.” "
"4153","Numbers","14","44","Nevertheless, in their presumption they went up toward the highest point in the hill country, though neither Moses nor the ark of the  Lord ’s covenant moved from the camp.  "
"4154","Numbers","14","45","Then the Amalekites and the Canaanites who lived in that hill country came down and attacked them and beat them down all the way to Hormah."
"4155","Numbers","15","1","The  Lord  said to Moses,  "
"4156","Numbers","15","2","“Speak to the Israelites and say to them: ‘After you enter the land I am giving you as a home  "
"4157","Numbers","15","3","and you present to the  Lord  food offerings from the herd or the flock, as an aroma pleasing to the  Lord —whether burnt offerings or sacrifices, for special vows or freewill offerings or festival offerings—  "
"4158","Numbers","15","4","then the person who brings an offering shall present to the  Lord  a grain offering of a tenth of an ephah  of the finest flour mixed with a quarter of a hin  of olive oil.  "
"4159","Numbers","15","5","With each lamb for the burnt offering or the sacrifice, prepare a quarter of a hin of wine as a drink offering. "
"4160","Numbers","15","6","“ ‘With a ram prepare a grain offering of two-tenths of an ephah  of the finest flour mixed with a third of a hin  of olive oil,  "
"4161","Numbers","15","7","and a third of a hin of wine as a drink offering. Offer it as an aroma pleasing to the  Lord . "
"4162","Numbers","15","8","“ ‘When you prepare a young bull as a burnt offering or sacrifice, for a special vow or a fellowship offering to the  Lord ,  "
"4163","Numbers","15","9","bring with the bull a grain offering of three-tenths of an ephah  of the finest flour mixed with half a hin  of olive oil,  "
"4164","Numbers","15","10","and also bring half a hin of wine as a drink offering. This will be a food offering, an aroma pleasing to the  Lord .  "
"4165","Numbers","15","11","Each bull or ram, each lamb or young goat, is to be prepared in this manner.  "
"4166","Numbers","15","12","Do this for each one, for as many as you prepare. "
"4167","Numbers","15","13","“ ‘Everyone who is native-born must do these things in this way when they present a food offering as an aroma pleasing to the  Lord .  "
"4168","Numbers","15","14","For the generations to come, whenever a foreigner or anyone else living among you presents a food offering as an aroma pleasing to the  Lord , they must do exactly as you do.  "
"4169","Numbers","15","15","The community is to have the same rules for you and for the foreigner residing among you; this is a lasting ordinance for the generations to come. You and the foreigner shall be the same before the  Lord :  "
"4170","Numbers","15","16","The same laws and regulations will apply both to you and to the foreigner residing among you.’ ” "
"4171","Numbers","15","17","The  Lord  said to Moses,  "
"4172","Numbers","15","18","“Speak to the Israelites and say to them: ‘When you enter the land to which I am taking you  "
"4173","Numbers","15","19","and you eat the food of the land, present a portion as an offering to the  Lord .  "
"4174","Numbers","15","20","Present a loaf from the first of your ground meal and present it as an offering from the threshing floor.  "
"4175","Numbers","15","21","Throughout the generations to come you are to give this offering to the  Lord  from the first of your ground meal. "
"4176","Numbers","15","22","“ ‘Now if you as a community unintentionally fail to keep any of these commands the  Lord  gave Moses—  "
"4177","Numbers","15","23","any of the  Lord ’s commands to you through him, from the day the  Lord  gave them and continuing through the generations to come—  "
"4178","Numbers","15","24","and if this is done unintentionally without the community being aware of it, then the whole community is to offer a young bull for a burnt offering as an aroma pleasing to the  Lord , along with its prescribed grain offering and drink offering, and a male goat for a sin offering.   "
"4179","Numbers","15","25","The priest is to make atonement for the whole Israelite community, and they will be forgiven, for it was not intentional and they have presented to the  Lord  for their wrong a food offering and a sin offering.  "
"4180","Numbers","15","26","The whole Israelite community and the foreigners residing among them will be forgiven, because all the people were involved in the unintentional wrong. "
"4181","Numbers","15","27","“ ‘But if just one person sins unintentionally, that person must bring a year-old female goat for a sin offering.  "
"4182","Numbers","15","28","The priest is to make atonement before the  Lord  for the one who erred by sinning unintentionally, and when atonement has been made, that person will be forgiven.  "
"4183","Numbers","15","29","One and the same law applies to everyone who sins unintentionally, whether a native-born Israelite or a foreigner residing among you. "
"4184","Numbers","15","30","“ ‘But anyone who sins defiantly, whether native-born or foreigner, blasphemes the  Lord  and must be cut off from the people of Israel.  "
"4185","Numbers","15","31","Because they have despised the  Lord ’s word and broken his commands, they must surely be cut off; their guilt remains on them.’ ” "
"4186","Numbers","15","32","While the Israelites were in the wilderness, a man was found gathering wood on the Sabbath day.  "
"4187","Numbers","15","33","Those who found him gathering wood brought him to Moses and Aaron and the whole assembly,  "
"4188","Numbers","15","34","and they kept him in custody, because it was not clear what should be done to him.  "
"4189","Numbers","15","35","Then the  Lord  said to Moses, “The man must die. The whole assembly must stone him outside the camp.”  "
"4190","Numbers","15","36","So the assembly took him outside the camp and stoned him to death, as the  Lord  commanded Moses. "
"4191","Numbers","15","37","The  Lord  said to Moses,  "
"4192","Numbers","15","38","“Speak to the Israelites and say to them: ‘Throughout the generations to come you are to make tassels on the corners of your garments, with a blue cord on each tassel.  "
"4193","Numbers","15","39","You will have these tassels to look at and so you will remember all the commands of the  Lord , that you may obey them and not prostitute yourselves by chasing after the lusts of your own hearts and eyes.  "
"4194","Numbers","15","40","Then you will remember to obey all my commands and will be consecrated to your God.  "
"4195","Numbers","15","41","I am the  Lord  your God, who brought you out of Egypt to be your God. I am the  Lord  your God.’ ”"
"4196","Numbers","16","1","Korah son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi, and certain Reubenites—Dathan and Abiram, sons of Eliab, and On son of Peleth—became insolent   "
"4197","Numbers","16","2","and rose up against Moses. With them were 250 Israelite men, well-known community leaders who had been appointed members of the council.  "
"4198","Numbers","16","3","They came as a group to oppose Moses and Aaron and said to them, “You have gone too far! The whole community is holy, every one of them, and the  Lord  is with them. Why then do you set yourselves above the  Lord ’s assembly?” "
"4199","Numbers","16","4","When Moses heard this, he fell facedown.  "
"4200","Numbers","16","5","Then he said to Korah and all his followers: “In the morning the  Lord  will show who belongs to him and who is holy, and he will have that person come near him. The man he chooses he will cause to come near him.  "
"4201","Numbers","16","6","You, Korah, and all your followers are to do this: Take censers  "
"4202","Numbers","16","7","and tomorrow put burning coals and incense in them before the  Lord . The man the  Lord  chooses will be the one who is holy. You Levites have gone too far!” "
"4203","Numbers","16","8","Moses also said to Korah, “Now listen, you Levites!  "
"4204","Numbers","16","9","Isn’t it enough for you that the God of Israel has separated you from the rest of the Israelite community and brought you near himself to do the work at the  Lord ’s tabernacle and to stand before the community and minister to them?  "
"4205","Numbers","16","10","He has brought you and all your fellow Levites near himself, but now you are trying to get the priesthood too.  "
"4206","Numbers","16","11","It is against the  Lord  that you and all your followers have banded together. Who is Aaron that you should grumble against him?” "
"4207","Numbers","16","12","Then Moses summoned Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab. But they said, “We will not come!  "
"4208","Numbers","16","13","Isn’t it enough that you have brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey to kill us in the wilderness? And now you also want to lord it over us!  "
"4209","Numbers","16","14","Moreover, you haven’t brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey or given us an inheritance of fields and vineyards. Do you want to treat these men like slaves ? No, we will not come!” "
"4210","Numbers","16","15","Then Moses became very angry and said to the  Lord , “Do not accept their offering. I have not taken so much as a donkey from them, nor have I wronged any of them.” "
"4211","Numbers","16","16","Moses said to Korah, “You and all your followers are to appear before the  Lord  tomorrow—you and they and Aaron.  "
"4212","Numbers","16","17","Each man is to take his censer and put incense in it—250 censers in all—and present it before the  Lord . You and Aaron are to present your censers also.”  "
"4213","Numbers","16","18","So each of them took his censer, put burning coals and incense in it, and stood with Moses and Aaron at the entrance to the tent of meeting.  "
"4214","Numbers","16","19","When Korah had gathered all his followers in opposition to them at the entrance to the tent of meeting, the glory of the  Lord  appeared to the entire assembly.  "
"4215","Numbers","16","20","The  Lord  said to Moses and Aaron,  "
"4216","Numbers","16","21","“Separate yourselves from this assembly so I can put an end to them at once.” "
"4217","Numbers","16","22","But Moses and Aaron fell facedown and cried out, “O God, the God who gives breath to all living things, will you be angry with the entire assembly when only one man sins?” "
"4218","Numbers","16","23","Then the  Lord  said to Moses,  "
"4219","Numbers","16","24","“Say to the assembly, ‘Move away from the tents of Korah, Dathan and Abiram.’ ” "
"4220","Numbers","16","25","Moses got up and went to Dathan and Abiram, and the elders of Israel followed him.  "
"4221","Numbers","16","26","He warned the assembly, “Move back from the tents of these wicked men! Do not touch anything belonging to them, or you will be swept away because of all their sins.”  "
"4222","Numbers","16","27","So they moved away from the tents of Korah, Dathan and Abiram. Dathan and Abiram had come out and were standing with their wives, children and little ones at the entrances to their tents. "
"4223","Numbers","16","28","Then Moses said, “This is how you will know that the  Lord  has sent me to do all these things and that it was not my idea:  "
"4224","Numbers","16","29","If these men die a natural death and suffer the fate of all mankind, then the  Lord  has not sent me.  "
"4225","Numbers","16","30","But if the  Lord  brings about something totally new, and the earth opens its mouth and swallows them, with everything that belongs to them, and they go down alive into the realm of the dead, then you will know that these men have treated the  Lord  with contempt.” "
"4226","Numbers","16","31","As soon as he finished saying all this, the ground under them split apart  "
"4227","Numbers","16","32","and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them and their households, and all those associated with Korah, together with their possessions.  "
"4228","Numbers","16","33","They went down alive into the realm of the dead, with everything they owned; the earth closed over them, and they perished and were gone from the community.  "
"4229","Numbers","16","34","At their cries, all the Israelites around them fled, shouting, “The earth is going to swallow us too!” "
"4230","Numbers","16","35","And fire came out from the  Lord  and consumed the 250 men who were offering the incense. "
"4231","Numbers","16","36","The  Lord  said to Moses,  "
"4232","Numbers","16","37","“Tell Eleazar son of Aaron, the priest, to remove the censers from the charred remains and scatter the coals some distance away, for the censers are holy—  "
"4233","Numbers","16","38","the censers of the men who sinned at the cost of their lives. Hammer the censers into sheets to overlay the altar, for they were presented before the  Lord  and have become holy. Let them be a sign to the Israelites.” "
"4234","Numbers","16","39","So Eleazar the priest collected the bronze censers brought by those who had been burned to death, and he had them hammered out to overlay the altar,  "
"4235","Numbers","16","40","as the  Lord  directed him through Moses. This was to remind the Israelites that no one except a descendant of Aaron should come to burn incense before the  Lord , or he would become like Korah and his followers. "
"4236","Numbers","16","41","The next day the whole Israelite community grumbled against Moses and Aaron. “You have killed the  Lord ’s people,” they said. "
"4237","Numbers","16","42","But when the assembly gathered in opposition to Moses and Aaron and turned toward the tent of meeting, suddenly the cloud covered it and the glory of the  Lord  appeared.  "
"4238","Numbers","16","43","Then Moses and Aaron went to the front of the tent of meeting,  "
"4239","Numbers","16","44","and the  Lord  said to Moses,  "
"4240","Numbers","16","45","“Get away from this assembly so I can put an end to them at once.” And they fell facedown. "
"4241","Numbers","16","46","Then Moses said to Aaron, “Take your censer and put incense in it, along with burning coals from the altar, and hurry to the assembly to make atonement for them. Wrath has come out from the  Lord ; the plague has started.”  "
"4242","Numbers","16","47","So Aaron did as Moses said, and ran into the midst of the assembly. The plague had already started among the people, but Aaron offered the incense and made atonement for them.  "
"4243","Numbers","16","48","He stood between the living and the dead, and the plague stopped.  "
"4244","Numbers","16","49","But 14,700 people died from the plague, in addition to those who had died because of Korah.  "
"4245","Numbers","16","50","Then Aaron returned to Moses at the entrance to the tent of meeting, for the plague had stopped."
"4246","Numbers","17","1","The  Lord  said to Moses,  "
"4247","Numbers","17","2","“Speak to the Israelites and get twelve staffs from them, one from the leader of each of their ancestral tribes. Write the name of each man on his staff.  "
"4248","Numbers","17","3","On the staff of Levi write Aaron’s name, for there must be one staff for the head of each ancestral tribe.  "
"4249","Numbers","17","4","Place them in the tent of meeting in front of the ark of the covenant law, where I meet with you.  "
"4250","Numbers","17","5","The staff belonging to the man I choose will sprout, and I will rid myself of this constant grumbling against you by the Israelites.” "
"4251","Numbers","17","6","So Moses spoke to the Israelites, and their leaders gave him twelve staffs, one for the leader of each of their ancestral tribes, and Aaron’s staff was among them.  "
"4252","Numbers","17","7","Moses placed the staffs before the  Lord  in the tent of the covenant law. "
"4253","Numbers","17","8","The next day Moses entered the tent and saw that Aaron’s staff, which represented the tribe of Levi, had not only sprouted but had budded, blossomed and produced almonds.  "
"4254","Numbers","17","9","Then Moses brought out all the staffs from the  Lord ’s presence to all the Israelites. They looked at them, and each of the leaders took his own staff. "
"4255","Numbers","17","10","The  Lord  said to Moses, “Put back Aaron’s staff in front of the ark of the covenant law, to be kept as a sign to the rebellious. This will put an end to their grumbling against me, so that they will not die.”  "
"4256","Numbers","17","11","Moses did just as the  Lord  commanded him. "
"4257","Numbers","17","12","The Israelites said to Moses, “We will die! We are lost, we are all lost!  "
"4258","Numbers","17","13","Anyone who even comes near the tabernacle of the  Lord  will die. Are we all going to die?”"
"4259","Numbers","18","1","The  Lord  said to Aaron, “You, your sons and your family are to bear the responsibility for offenses connected with the sanctuary, and you and your sons alone are to bear the responsibility for offenses connected with the priesthood.  "
"4260","Numbers","18","2","Bring your fellow Levites from your ancestral tribe to join you and assist you when you and your sons minister before the tent of the covenant law.  "
"4261","Numbers","18","3","They are to be responsible to you and are to perform all the duties of the tent, but they must not go near the furnishings of the sanctuary or the altar. Otherwise both they and you will die.  "
"4262","Numbers","18","4","They are to join you and be responsible for the care of the tent of meeting—all the work at the tent—and no one else may come near where you are. "
"4263","Numbers","18","5","“You are to be responsible for the care of the sanctuary and the altar, so that my wrath will not fall on the Israelites again.  "
"4264","Numbers","18","6","I myself have selected your fellow Levites from among the Israelites as a gift to you, dedicated to the  Lord  to do the work at the tent of meeting.  "
"4265","Numbers","18","7","But only you and your sons may serve as priests in connection with everything at the altar and inside the curtain. I am giving you the service of the priesthood as a gift. Anyone else who comes near the sanctuary is to be put to death.” "
"4266","Numbers","18","8","Then the  Lord  said to Aaron, “I myself have put you in charge of the offerings presented to me; all the holy offerings the Israelites give me I give to you and your sons as your portion, your perpetual share.  "
"4267","Numbers","18","9","You are to have the part of the most holy offerings that is kept from the fire. From all the gifts they bring me as most holy offerings, whether grain or sin  or guilt offerings, that part belongs to you and your sons.  "
"4268","Numbers","18","10","Eat it as something most holy; every male shall eat it. You must regard it as holy. "
"4269","Numbers","18","11","“This also is yours: whatever is set aside from the gifts of all the wave offerings of the Israelites. I give this to you and your sons and daughters as your perpetual share. Everyone in your household who is ceremonially clean may eat it. "
"4270","Numbers","18","12","“I give you all the finest olive oil and all the finest new wine and grain they give the  Lord  as the firstfruits of their harvest.  "
"4271","Numbers","18","13","All the land’s firstfruits that they bring to the  Lord  will be yours. Everyone in your household who is ceremonially clean may eat it. "
"4272","Numbers","18","14","“Everything in Israel that is devoted  to the  Lord  is yours.  "
"4273","Numbers","18","15","The first offspring of every womb, both human and animal, that is offered to the  Lord  is yours. But you must redeem every firstborn son and every firstborn male of unclean animals.  "
"4274","Numbers","18","16","When they are a month old, you must redeem them at the redemption price set at five shekels  of silver, according to the sanctuary shekel, which weighs twenty gerahs. "
"4275","Numbers","18","17","“But you must not redeem the firstborn of a cow, a sheep or a goat; they are holy. Splash their blood against the altar and burn their fat as a food offering, an aroma pleasing to the  Lord .  "
"4276","Numbers","18","18","Their meat is to be yours, just as the breast of the wave offering and the right thigh are yours.  "
"4277","Numbers","18","19","Whatever is set aside from the holy offerings the Israelites present to the  Lord  I give to you and your sons and daughters as your perpetual share. It is an everlasting covenant of salt before the  Lord  for both you and your offspring.” "
"4278","Numbers","18","20","The  Lord  said to Aaron, “You will have no inheritance in their land, nor will you have any share among them; I am your share and your inheritance among the Israelites. "
"4279","Numbers","18","21","“I give to the Levites all the tithes in Israel as their inheritance in return for the work they do while serving at the tent of meeting.  "
"4280","Numbers","18","22","From now on the Israelites must not go near the tent of meeting, or they will bear the consequences of their sin and will die.  "
"4281","Numbers","18","23","It is the Levites who are to do the work at the tent of meeting and bear the responsibility for any offenses they commit against it. This is a lasting ordinance for the generations to come. They will receive no inheritance among the Israelites.  "
"4282","Numbers","18","24","Instead, I give to the Levites as their inheritance the tithes that the Israelites present as an offering to the  Lord . That is why I said concerning them: ‘They will have no inheritance among the Israelites.’ ” "
"4283","Numbers","18","25","The  Lord  said to Moses,  "
"4284","Numbers","18","26","“Speak to the Levites and say to them: ‘When you receive from the Israelites the tithe I give you as your inheritance, you must present a tenth of that tithe as the  Lord ’s offering.  "
"4285","Numbers","18","27","Your offering will be reckoned to you as grain from the threshing floor or juice from the winepress.  "
"4286","Numbers","18","28","In this way you also will present an offering to the  Lord  from all the tithes you receive from the Israelites. From these tithes you must give the  Lord ’s portion to Aaron the priest.  "
"4287","Numbers","18","29","You must present as the  Lord ’s portion the best and holiest part of everything given to you.’ "
"4288","Numbers","18","30","“Say to the Levites: ‘When you present the best part, it will be reckoned to you as the product of the threshing floor or the winepress.  "
"4289","Numbers","18","31","You and your households may eat the rest of it anywhere, for it is your wages for your work at the tent of meeting.  "
"4290","Numbers","18","32","By presenting the best part of it you will not be guilty in this matter; then you will not defile the holy offerings of the Israelites, and you will not die.’ ”"
"4291","Numbers","19","1","The  Lord  said to Moses and Aaron:  "
"4292","Numbers","19","2","“This is a requirement of the law that the  Lord  has commanded: Tell the Israelites to bring you a red heifer without defect or blemish and that has never been under a yoke.  "
"4293","Numbers","19","3","Give it to Eleazar the priest; it is to be taken outside the camp and slaughtered in his presence.  "
"4294","Numbers","19","4","Then Eleazar the priest is to take some of its blood on his finger and sprinkle it seven times toward the front of the tent of meeting.  "
"4295","Numbers","19","5","While he watches, the heifer is to be burned—its hide, flesh, blood and intestines.  "
"4296","Numbers","19","6","The priest is to take some cedar wood, hyssop and scarlet wool and throw them onto the burning heifer.  "
"4297","Numbers","19","7","After that, the priest must wash his clothes and bathe himself with water. He may then come into the camp, but he will be ceremonially unclean till evening.  "
"4298","Numbers","19","8","The man who burns it must also wash his clothes and bathe with water, and he too will be unclean till evening. "
"4299","Numbers","19","9","“A man who is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer and put them in a ceremonially clean place outside the camp. They are to be kept by the Israelite community for use in the water of cleansing; it is for purification from sin.  "
"4300","Numbers","19","10","The man who gathers up the ashes of the heifer must also wash his clothes, and he too will be unclean till evening. This will be a lasting ordinance both for the Israelites and for the foreigners residing among them. "
"4301","Numbers","19","11","“Whoever touches a human corpse will be unclean for seven days.  "
"4302","Numbers","19","12","They must purify themselves with the water on the third day and on the seventh day; then they will be clean. But if they do not purify themselves on the third and seventh days, they will not be clean.  "
"4303","Numbers","19","13","If they fail to purify themselves after touching a human corpse, they defile the  Lord ’s tabernacle. They must be cut off from Israel. Because the water of cleansing has not been sprinkled on them, they are unclean; their uncleanness remains on them. "
"4304","Numbers","19","14","“This is the law that applies when a person dies in a tent: Anyone who enters the tent and anyone who is in it will be unclean for seven days,  "
"4305","Numbers","19","15","and every open container without a lid fastened on it will be unclean. "
"4306","Numbers","19","16","“Anyone out in the open who touches someone who has been killed with a sword or someone who has died a natural death, or anyone who touches a human bone or a grave, will be unclean for seven days. "
"4307","Numbers","19","17","“For the unclean person, put some ashes from the burned purification offering into a jar and pour fresh water over them.  "
"4308","Numbers","19","18","Then a man who is ceremonially clean is to take some hyssop, dip it in the water and sprinkle the tent and all the furnishings and the people who were there. He must also sprinkle anyone who has touched a human bone or a grave or anyone who has been killed or anyone who has died a natural death.  "
"4309","Numbers","19","19","The man who is clean is to sprinkle those who are unclean on the third and seventh days, and on the seventh day he is to purify them. Those who are being cleansed must wash their clothes and bathe with water, and that evening they will be clean.  "
"4310","Numbers","19","20","But if those who are unclean do not purify themselves, they must be cut off from the community, because they have defiled the sanctuary of the  Lord . The water of cleansing has not been sprinkled on them, and they are unclean.  "
"4311","Numbers","19","21","This is a lasting ordinance for them. “The man who sprinkles the water of cleansing must also wash his clothes, and anyone who touches the water of cleansing will be unclean till evening.  "
"4312","Numbers","19","22","Anything that an unclean person touches becomes unclean, and anyone who touches it becomes unclean till evening.”"
"4313","Numbers","20","1","In the first month the whole Israelite community arrived at the Desert of Zin, and they stayed at Kadesh. There Miriam died and was buried. "
"4314","Numbers","20","2","Now there was no water for the community, and the people gathered in opposition to Moses and Aaron.  "
"4315","Numbers","20","3","They quarreled with Moses and said, “If only we had died when our brothers fell dead before the  Lord !  "
"4316","Numbers","20","4","Why did you bring the  Lord ’s community into this wilderness, that we and our livestock should die here?  "
"4317","Numbers","20","5","Why did you bring us up out of Egypt to this terrible place? It has no grain or figs, grapevines or pomegranates. And there is no water to drink!” "
"4318","Numbers","20","6","Moses and Aaron went from the assembly to the entrance to the tent of meeting and fell facedown, and the glory of the  Lord  appeared to them.  "
"4319","Numbers","20","7","The  Lord  said to Moses,  "
"4320","Numbers","20","8","“Take the staff, and you and your brother Aaron gather the assembly together. Speak to that rock before their eyes and it will pour out its water. You will bring water out of the rock for the community so they and their livestock can drink.” "
"4321","Numbers","20","9","So Moses took the staff from the  Lord ’s presence, just as he commanded him.  "
"4322","Numbers","20","10","He and Aaron gathered the assembly together in front of the rock and Moses said to them, “Listen, you rebels, must we bring you water out of this rock?”  "
"4323","Numbers","20","11","Then Moses raised his arm and struck the rock twice with his staff. Water gushed out, and the community and their livestock drank. "
"4324","Numbers","20","12","But the  Lord  said to Moses and Aaron, “Because you did not trust in me enough to honor me as holy in the sight of the Israelites, you will not bring this community into the land I give them.” "
"4325","Numbers","20","13","These were the waters of Meribah,  where the Israelites quarreled with the  Lord  and where he was proved holy among them. "
"4326","Numbers","20","14","Moses sent messengers from Kadesh to the king of Edom, saying: “This is what your brother Israel says: You know about all the hardships that have come on us.  "
"4327","Numbers","20","15","Our ancestors went down into Egypt, and we lived there many years. The Egyptians mistreated us and our ancestors,  "
"4328","Numbers","20","16","but when we cried out to the  Lord , he heard our cry and sent an angel and brought us out of Egypt. “Now we are here at Kadesh, a town on the edge of your territory.  "
"4329","Numbers","20","17","Please let us pass through your country. We will not go through any field or vineyard, or drink water from any well. We will travel along the King’s Highway and not turn to the right or to the left until we have passed through your territory.” "
"4330","Numbers","20","18","But Edom answered: “You may not pass through here; if you try, we will march out and attack you with the sword.” "
"4331","Numbers","20","19","The Israelites replied: “We will go along the main road, and if we or our livestock drink any of your water, we will pay for it. We only want to pass through on foot—nothing else.” "
"4332","Numbers","20","20","Again they answered: “You may not pass through.” Then Edom came out against them with a large and powerful army.  "
"4333","Numbers","20","21","Since Edom refused to let them go through their territory, Israel turned away from them. "
"4334","Numbers","20","22","The whole Israelite community set out from Kadesh and came to Mount Hor.  "
"4335","Numbers","20","23","At Mount Hor, near the border of Edom, the  Lord  said to Moses and Aaron,  "
"4336","Numbers","20","24","“Aaron will be gathered to his people. He will not enter the land I give the Israelites, because both of you rebelled against my command at the waters of Meribah.  "
"4337","Numbers","20","25","Get Aaron and his son Eleazar and take them up Mount Hor.  "
"4338","Numbers","20","26","Remove Aaron’s garments and put them on his son Eleazar, for Aaron will be gathered to his people; he will die there.” "
"4339","Numbers","20","27","Moses did as the  Lord  commanded: They went up Mount Hor in the sight of the whole community.  "
"4340","Numbers","20","28","Moses removed Aaron’s garments and put them on his son Eleazar. And Aaron died there on top of the mountain. Then Moses and Eleazar came down from the mountain,  "
"4341","Numbers","20","29","and when the whole community learned that Aaron had died, all the Israelites mourned for him thirty days."
"4342","Numbers","21","1","When the Canaanite king of Arad, who lived in the Negev, heard that Israel was coming along the road to Atharim, he attacked the Israelites and captured some of them.  "
"4343","Numbers","21","2","Then Israel made this vow to the  Lord : “If you will deliver these people into our hands, we will totally destroy  their cities.”  "
"4344","Numbers","21","3","The  Lord  listened to Israel’s plea and gave the Canaanites over to them. They completely destroyed them and their towns; so the place was named Hormah. "
"4345","Numbers","21","4","They traveled from Mount Hor along the route to the Red Sea,  to go around Edom. But the people grew impatient on the way;  "
"4346","Numbers","21","5","they spoke against God and against Moses, and said, “Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? There is no bread! There is no water! And we detest this miserable food!” "
"4347","Numbers","21","6","Then the  Lord  sent venomous snakes among them; they bit the people and many Israelites died.  "
"4348","Numbers","21","7","The people came to Moses and said, “We sinned when we spoke against the  Lord  and against you. Pray that the  Lord  will take the snakes away from us.” So Moses prayed for the people. "
"4349","Numbers","21","8","The  Lord  said to Moses, “Make a snake and put it up on a pole; anyone who is bitten can look at it and live.”  "
"4350","Numbers","21","9","So Moses made a bronze snake and put it up on a pole. Then when anyone was bitten by a snake and looked at the bronze snake, they lived. "
"4351","Numbers","21","10","The Israelites moved on and camped at Oboth.  "
"4352","Numbers","21","11","Then they set out from Oboth and camped in Iye Abarim, in the wilderness that faces Moab toward the sunrise.  "
"4353","Numbers","21","12","From there they moved on and camped in the Zered Valley.  "
"4354","Numbers","21","13","They set out from there and camped alongside the Arnon, which is in the wilderness extending into Amorite territory. The Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites.  "
"4355","Numbers","21","14","That is why the Book of the Wars of the  Lord  says: “…Zahab  in Suphah and the ravines, the Arnon  "
"4356","Numbers","21","15","and  the slopes of the ravines that lead to the settlement of Ar and lie along the border of Moab.” "
"4357","Numbers","21","16","From there they continued on to Beer, the well where the  Lord  said to Moses, “Gather the people together and I will give them water.” "
"4358","Numbers","21","17","Then Israel sang this song: “Spring up, O well! Sing about it, "
"4359","Numbers","21","18","about the well that the princes dug, that the nobles of the people sank— the nobles with scepters and staffs.” Then they went from the wilderness to Mattanah,  "
"4360","Numbers","21","19","from Mattanah to Nahaliel, from Nahaliel to Bamoth,  "
"4361","Numbers","21","20","and from Bamoth to the valley in Moab where the top of Pisgah overlooks the wasteland. "
"4362","Numbers","21","21","Israel sent messengers to say to Sihon king of the Amorites: "
"4363","Numbers","21","22","“Let us pass through your country. We will not turn aside into any field or vineyard, or drink water from any well. We will travel along the King’s Highway until we have passed through your territory.” "
"4364","Numbers","21","23","But Sihon would not let Israel pass through his territory. He mustered his entire army and marched out into the wilderness against Israel. When he reached Jahaz, he fought with Israel.  "
"4365","Numbers","21","24","Israel, however, put him to the sword and took over his land from the Arnon to the Jabbok, but only as far as the Ammonites, because their border was fortified.  "
"4366","Numbers","21","25","Israel captured all the cities of the Amorites and occupied them, including Heshbon and all its surrounding settlements.  "
"4367","Numbers","21","26","Heshbon was the city of Sihon king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab and had taken from him all his land as far as the Arnon. "
"4368","Numbers","21","27","That is why the poets say: “Come to Heshbon and let it be rebuilt; let Sihon’s city be restored. "
"4369","Numbers","21","28","“Fire went out from Heshbon, a blaze from the city of Sihon. It consumed Ar of Moab, the citizens of Arnon’s heights. "
"4370","Numbers","21","29","Woe to you, Moab! You are destroyed, people of Chemosh! He has given up his sons as fugitives and his daughters as captives to Sihon king of the Amorites. "
"4371","Numbers","21","30","“But we have overthrown them; Heshbon’s dominion has been destroyed all the way to Dibon. We have demolished them as far as Nophah, which extends to Medeba.” "
"4372","Numbers","21","31","So Israel settled in the land of the Amorites. "
"4373","Numbers","21","32","After Moses had sent spies to Jazer, the Israelites captured its surrounding settlements and drove out the Amorites who were there.  "
"4374","Numbers","21","33","Then they turned and went up along the road toward Bashan, and Og king of Bashan and his whole army marched out to meet them in battle at Edrei. "
"4375","Numbers","21","34","The  Lord  said to Moses, “Do not be afraid of him, for I have delivered him into your hands, along with his whole army and his land. Do to him what you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon.” "
"4376","Numbers","21","35","So they struck him down, together with his sons and his whole army, leaving them no survivors. And they took possession of his land."
"4377","Numbers","22","1","Then the Israelites traveled to the plains of Moab and camped along the Jordan across from Jericho. "
"4378","Numbers","22","2","Now Balak son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites,  "
"4379","Numbers","22","3","and Moab was terrified because there were so many people. Indeed, Moab was filled with dread because of the Israelites. "
"4380","Numbers","22","4","The Moabites said to the elders of Midian, “This horde is going to lick up everything around us, as an ox licks up the grass of the field.” So Balak son of Zippor, who was king of Moab at that time,  "
"4381","Numbers","22","5","sent messengers to summon Balaam son of Beor, who was at Pethor, near the Euphrates River, in his native land. Balak said: “A people has come out of Egypt; they cover the face of the land and have settled next to me.  "
"4382","Numbers","22","6","Now come and put a curse on these people, because they are too powerful for me. Perhaps then I will be able to defeat them and drive them out of the land. For I know that whoever you bless is blessed, and whoever you curse is cursed.” "
"4383","Numbers","22","7","The elders of Moab and Midian left, taking with them the fee for divination. When they came to Balaam, they told him what Balak had said. "
"4384","Numbers","22","8","“Spend the night here,” Balaam said to them, “and I will report back to you with the answer the  Lord  gives me.” So the Moabite officials stayed with him. "
"4385","Numbers","22","9","God came to Balaam and asked, “Who are these men with you?” "
"4386","Numbers","22","10","Balaam said to God, “Balak son of Zippor, king of Moab, sent me this message:  "
"4387","Numbers","22","11","‘A people that has come out of Egypt covers the face of the land. Now come and put a curse on them for me. Perhaps then I will be able to fight them and drive them away.’ ” "
"4388","Numbers","22","12","But God said to Balaam, “Do not go with them. You must not put a curse on those people, because they are blessed.” "
"4389","Numbers","22","13","The next morning Balaam got up and said to Balak’s officials, “Go back to your own country, for the  Lord  has refused to let me go with you.” "
"4390","Numbers","22","14","So the Moabite officials returned to Balak and said, “Balaam refused to come with us.” "
"4391","Numbers","22","15","Then Balak sent other officials, more numerous and more distinguished than the first.  "
"4392","Numbers","22","16","They came to Balaam and said: “This is what Balak son of Zippor says: Do not let anything keep you from coming to me,  "
"4393","Numbers","22","17","because I will reward you handsomely and do whatever you say. Come and put a curse on these people for me.” "
"4394","Numbers","22","18","But Balaam answered them, “Even if Balak gave me all the silver and gold in his palace, I could not do anything great or small to go beyond the command of the  Lord  my God.  "
"4395","Numbers","22","19","Now spend the night here so that I can find out what else the  Lord  will tell me.” "
"4396","Numbers","22","20","That night God came to Balaam and said, “Since these men have come to summon you, go with them, but do only what I tell you.” "
"4397","Numbers","22","21","Balaam got up in the morning, saddled his donkey and went with the Moabite officials.  "
"4398","Numbers","22","22","But God was very angry when he went, and the angel of the  Lord  stood in the road to oppose him. Balaam was riding on his donkey, and his two servants were with him.  "
"4399","Numbers","22","23","When the donkey saw the angel of the  Lord  standing in the road with a drawn sword in his hand, it turned off the road into a field. Balaam beat it to get it back on the road. "
"4400","Numbers","22","24","Then the angel of the  Lord  stood in a narrow path through the vineyards, with walls on both sides.  "
"4401","Numbers","22","25","When the donkey saw the angel of the  Lord , it pressed close to the wall, crushing Balaam’s foot against it. So he beat the donkey again. "
"4402","Numbers","22","26","Then the angel of the  Lord  moved on ahead and stood in a narrow place where there was no room to turn, either to the right or to the left.  "
"4403","Numbers","22","27","When the donkey saw the angel of the  Lord , it lay down under Balaam, and he was angry and beat it with his staff.  "
"4404","Numbers","22","28","Then the  Lord  opened the donkey’s mouth, and it said to Balaam, “What have I done to you to make you beat me these three times?” "
"4405","Numbers","22","29","Balaam answered the donkey, “You have made a fool of me! If only I had a sword in my hand, I would kill you right now.” "
"4406","Numbers","22","30","The donkey said to Balaam, “Am I not your own donkey, which you have always ridden, to this day? Have I been in the habit of doing this to you?” “No,” he said. "
"4407","Numbers","22","31","Then the  Lord  opened Balaam’s eyes, and he saw the angel of the  Lord  standing in the road with his sword drawn. So he bowed low and fell facedown. "
"4408","Numbers","22","32","The angel of the  Lord  asked him, “Why have you beaten your donkey these three times? I have come here to oppose you because your path is a reckless one before me.   "
"4409","Numbers","22","33","The donkey saw me and turned away from me these three times. If it had not turned away, I would certainly have killed you by now, but I would have spared it.” "
"4410","Numbers","22","34","Balaam said to the angel of the  Lord , “I have sinned. I did not realize you were standing in the road to oppose me. Now if you are displeased, I will go back.” "
"4411","Numbers","22","35","The angel of the  Lord  said to Balaam, “Go with the men, but speak only what I tell you.” So Balaam went with Balak’s officials. "
"4412","Numbers","22","36","When Balak heard that Balaam was coming, he went out to meet him at the Moabite town on the Arnon border, at the edge of his territory.  "
"4413","Numbers","22","37","Balak said to Balaam, “Did I not send you an urgent summons? Why didn’t you come to me? Am I really not able to reward you?” "
"4414","Numbers","22","38","“Well, I have come to you now,” Balaam replied. “But I can’t say whatever I please. I must speak only what God puts in my mouth.” "
"4415","Numbers","22","39","Then Balaam went with Balak to Kiriath Huzoth.  "
"4416","Numbers","22","40","Balak sacrificed cattle and sheep, and gave some to Balaam and the officials who were with him.  "
"4417","Numbers","22","41","The next morning Balak took Balaam up to Bamoth Baal, and from there he could see the outskirts of the Israelite camp."
"4418","Numbers","23","1","Balaam said, “Build me seven altars here, and prepare seven bulls and seven rams for me.”  "
"4419","Numbers","23","2","Balak did as Balaam said, and the two of them offered a bull and a ram on each altar. "
"4420","Numbers","23","3","Then Balaam said to Balak, “Stay here beside your offering while I go aside. Perhaps the  Lord  will come to meet with me. Whatever he reveals to me I will tell you.” Then he went off to a barren height. "
"4421","Numbers","23","4","God met with him, and Balaam said, “I have prepared seven altars, and on each altar I have offered a bull and a ram.” "
"4422","Numbers","23","5","The  Lord  put a word in Balaam’s mouth and said, “Go back to Balak and give him this word.” "
"4423","Numbers","23","6","So he went back to him and found him standing beside his offering, with all the Moabite officials.  "
"4424","Numbers","23","7","Then Balaam spoke his message: “Balak brought me from Aram, the king of Moab from the eastern mountains. ‘Come,’ he said, ‘curse Jacob for me; come, denounce Israel.’ "
"4425","Numbers","23","8","How can I curse those whom God has not cursed? How can I denounce those whom the  Lord  has not denounced? "
"4426","Numbers","23","9","From the rocky peaks I see them, from the heights I view them. I see a people who live apart and do not consider themselves one of the nations. "
"4427","Numbers","23","10","Who can count the dust of Jacob or number even a fourth of Israel? Let me die the death of the righteous, and may my final end be like theirs!” "
"4428","Numbers","23","11","Balak said to Balaam, “What have you done to me? I brought you to curse my enemies, but you have done nothing but bless them!” "
"4429","Numbers","23","12","He answered, “Must I not speak what the  Lord  puts in my mouth?” "
"4430","Numbers","23","13","Then Balak said to him, “Come with me to another place where you can see them; you will not see them all but only the outskirts of their camp. And from there, curse them for me.”  "
"4431","Numbers","23","14","So he took him to the field of Zophim on the top of Pisgah, and there he built seven altars and offered a bull and a ram on each altar. "
"4432","Numbers","23","15","Balaam said to Balak, “Stay here beside your offering while I meet with him over there.” "
"4433","Numbers","23","16","The  Lord  met with Balaam and put a word in his mouth and said, “Go back to Balak and give him this word.” "
"4434","Numbers","23","17","So he went to him and found him standing beside his offering, with the Moabite officials. Balak asked him, “What did the  Lord  say?” "
"4435","Numbers","23","18","Then he spoke his message: “Arise, Balak, and listen; hear me, son of Zippor. "
"4436","Numbers","23","19","God is not human, that he should lie, not a human being, that he should change his mind. Does he speak and then not act? Does he promise and not fulfill? "
"4437","Numbers","23","20","I have received a command to bless; he has blessed, and I cannot change it. "
"4438","Numbers","23","21","“No misfortune is seen in Jacob, no misery observed  in Israel. The  Lord  their God is with them; the shout of the King is among them. "
"4439","Numbers","23","22","God brought them out of Egypt; they have the strength of a wild ox. "
"4440","Numbers","23","23","There is no divination against  Jacob, no evil omens against  Israel. It will now be said of Jacob and of Israel, ‘See what God has done!’ "
"4441","Numbers","23","24","The people rise like a lioness; they rouse themselves like a lion that does not rest till it devours its prey and drinks the blood of its victims.” "
"4442","Numbers","23","25","Then Balak said to Balaam, “Neither curse them at all nor bless them at all!” "
"4443","Numbers","23","26","Balaam answered, “Did I not tell you I must do whatever the  Lord  says?” "
"4444","Numbers","23","27","Then Balak said to Balaam, “Come, let me take you to another place. Perhaps it will please God to let you curse them for me from there.”  "
"4445","Numbers","23","28","And Balak took Balaam to the top of Peor, overlooking the wasteland. "
"4446","Numbers","23","29","Balaam said, “Build me seven altars here, and prepare seven bulls and seven rams for me.”  "
"4447","Numbers","23","30","Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered a bull and a ram on each altar."
"4448","Numbers","24","1","Now when Balaam saw that it pleased the  Lord  to bless Israel, he did not resort to divination as at other times, but turned his face toward the wilderness.  "
"4449","Numbers","24","2","When Balaam looked out and saw Israel encamped tribe by tribe, the Spirit of God came on him  "
"4450","Numbers","24","3","and he spoke his message: “The prophecy of Balaam son of Beor, the prophecy of one whose eye sees clearly, "
"4451","Numbers","24","4","the prophecy of one who hears the words of God, who sees a vision from the Almighty, who falls prostrate, and whose eyes are opened: "
"4452","Numbers","24","5","“How beautiful are your tents, Jacob, your dwelling places, Israel! "
"4453","Numbers","24","6","“Like valleys they spread out, like gardens beside a river, like aloes planted by the  Lord , like cedars beside the waters. "
"4454","Numbers","24","7","Water will flow from their buckets; their seed will have abundant water. “Their king will be greater than Agag; their kingdom will be exalted. "
"4455","Numbers","24","8","“God brought them out of Egypt; they have the strength of a wild ox. They devour hostile nations and break their bones in pieces; with their arrows they pierce them. "
"4456","Numbers","24","9","Like a lion they crouch and lie down, like a lioness—who dares to rouse them? “May those who bless you be blessed and those who curse you be cursed!” "
"4457","Numbers","24","10","Then Balak’s anger burned against Balaam. He struck his hands together and said to him, “I summoned you to curse my enemies, but you have blessed them these three times.  "
"4458","Numbers","24","11","Now leave at once and go home! I said I would reward you handsomely, but the  Lord  has kept you from being rewarded.” "
"4459","Numbers","24","12","Balaam answered Balak, “Did I not tell the messengers you sent me,  "
"4460","Numbers","24","13","‘Even if Balak gave me all the silver and gold in his palace, I could not do anything of my own accord, good or bad, to go beyond the command of the  Lord —and I must say only what the  Lord  says’?  "
"4461","Numbers","24","14","Now I am going back to my people, but come, let me warn you of what this people will do to your people in days to come.” "
"4462","Numbers","24","15","Then he spoke his message: “The prophecy of Balaam son of Beor, the prophecy of one whose eye sees clearly, "
"4463","Numbers","24","16","the prophecy of one who hears the words of God, who has knowledge from the Most High, who sees a vision from the Almighty, who falls prostrate, and whose eyes are opened: "
"4464","Numbers","24","17","“I see him, but not now; I behold him, but not near. A star will come out of Jacob; a scepter will rise out of Israel. He will crush the foreheads of Moab, the skulls  of  all the people of Sheth. "
"4465","Numbers","24","18","Edom will be conquered; Seir, his enemy, will be conquered, but Israel will grow strong. "
"4466","Numbers","24","19","A ruler will come out of Jacob and destroy the survivors of the city.” "
"4467","Numbers","24","20","Then Balaam saw Amalek and spoke his message: “Amalek was first among the nations, but their end will be utter destruction.” "
"4468","Numbers","24","21","Then he saw the Kenites and spoke his message: “Your dwelling place is secure, your nest is set in a rock; "
"4469","Numbers","24","22","yet you Kenites will be destroyed when Ashur takes you captive.” "
"4470","Numbers","24","23","Then he spoke his message: “Alas! Who can live when God does this? "
"4471","Numbers","24","24","Ships will come from the shores of Cyprus; they will subdue Ashur and Eber, but they too will come to ruin.” "
"4472","Numbers","24","25","Then Balaam got up and returned home, and Balak went his own way."
"4473","Numbers","25","1","While Israel was staying in Shittim, the men began to indulge in sexual immorality with Moabite women,  "
"4474","Numbers","25","2","who invited them to the sacrifices to their gods. The people ate the sacrificial meal and bowed down before these gods.  "
"4475","Numbers","25","3","So Israel yoked themselves to the Baal of Peor. And the  Lord ’s anger burned against them. "
"4476","Numbers","25","4","The  Lord  said to Moses, “Take all the leaders of these people, kill them and expose them in broad daylight before the  Lord , so that the  Lord ’s fierce anger may turn away from Israel.” "
"4477","Numbers","25","5","So Moses said to Israel’s judges, “Each of you must put to death those of your people who have yoked themselves to the Baal of Peor.” "
"4478","Numbers","25","6","Then an Israelite man brought into the camp a Midianite woman right before the eyes of Moses and the whole assembly of Israel while they were weeping at the entrance to the tent of meeting.  "
"4479","Numbers","25","7","When Phinehas son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, the priest, saw this, he left the assembly, took a spear in his hand  "
"4480","Numbers","25","8","and followed the Israelite into the tent. He drove the spear into both of them, right through the Israelite man and into the woman’s stomach. Then the plague against the Israelites was stopped;  "
"4481","Numbers","25","9","but those who died in the plague numbered 24,000. "
"4482","Numbers","25","10","The  Lord  said to Moses,  "
"4483","Numbers","25","11","“Phinehas son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, the priest, has turned my anger away from the Israelites. Since he was as zealous for my honor among them as I am, I did not put an end to them in my zeal.  "
"4484","Numbers","25","12","Therefore tell him I am making my covenant of peace with him.  "
"4485","Numbers","25","13","He and his descendants will have a covenant of a lasting priesthood, because he was zealous for the honor of his God and made atonement for the Israelites.” "
"4486","Numbers","25","14","The name of the Israelite who was killed with the Midianite woman was Zimri son of Salu, the leader of a Simeonite family.  "
"4487","Numbers","25","15","And the name of the Midianite woman who was put to death was Kozbi daughter of Zur, a tribal chief of a Midianite family. "
"4488","Numbers","25","16","The  Lord  said to Moses,  "
"4489","Numbers","25","17","“Treat the Midianites as enemies and kill them.  "
"4490","Numbers","25","18","They treated you as enemies when they deceived you in the Peor incident involving their sister Kozbi, the daughter of a Midianite leader, the woman who was killed when the plague came as a result of that incident.”"
"4491","Numbers","26","1","After the plague the  Lord  said to Moses and Eleazar son of Aaron, the priest,  "
"4492","Numbers","26","2","“Take a census of the whole Israelite community by families—all those twenty years old or more who are able to serve in the army of Israel.”  "
"4493","Numbers","26","3","So on the plains of Moab by the Jordan across from Jericho, Moses and Eleazar the priest spoke with them and said,  "
"4494","Numbers","26","4","“Take a census of the men twenty years old or more, as the  Lord  commanded Moses.” These were the Israelites who came out of Egypt: "
"4495","Numbers","26","5","The descendants of Reuben, the firstborn son of Israel, were: through Hanok, the Hanokite clan; through Pallu, the Palluite clan; "
"4496","Numbers","26","6","through Hezron, the Hezronite clan; through Karmi, the Karmite clan. "
"4497","Numbers","26","7","These were the clans of Reuben; those numbered were 43,730. "
"4498","Numbers","26","8","The son of Pallu was Eliab,  "
"4499","Numbers","26","9","and the sons of Eliab were Nemuel, Dathan and Abiram. The same Dathan and Abiram were the community officials who rebelled against Moses and Aaron and were among Korah’s followers when they rebelled against the  Lord .  "
"4500","Numbers","26","10","The earth opened its mouth and swallowed them along with Korah, whose followers died when the fire devoured the 250 men. And they served as a warning sign.  "
"4501","Numbers","26","11","The line of Korah, however, did not die out. "
"4502","Numbers","26","12","The descendants of Simeon by their clans were: through Nemuel, the Nemuelite clan; through Jamin, the Jaminite clan; through Jakin, the Jakinite clan; "

"4556","Numbers","27","1","The daughters of Zelophehad son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Makir, the son of Manasseh, belonged to the clans of Manasseh son of Joseph. The names of the daughters were Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milkah and Tirzah. They came forward  "

"4559","Numbers","27","4","Why should our father’s name disappear from his clan because he had no son? Give us property among our father’s relatives.” "

"4576","Numbers","27","21","He is to stand before Eleazar the priest, who will obtain decisions for him by inquiring of the Urim before the  Lord . At his command he and the entire community of the Israelites will go out, and at his command they will come in.” "
"4577","Numbers","27","22","Moses did as the  Lord  commanded him. He took Joshua and had him stand before Eleazar the priest and the whole assembly.  "

"4651","Numbers","30","2","When a man makes a vow to the  Lord  or takes an oath to obligate himself by a pledge, he must not break his word but must do everything he said. "

"4654","Numbers","30","5","But if her father forbids her when he hears about it, none of her vows or the pledges by which she obligated herself will stand; the  Lord  will release her because her father has forbidden her. "
"4655","Numbers","30","6","“If she marries after she makes a vow or after her lips utter a rash promise by which she obligates herself  "
"4656","Numbers","30","7","and her husband hears about it but says nothing to her, then her vows or the pledges by which she obligated herself will stand.  "
"4657","Numbers","30","8","But if her husband forbids her when he hears about it, he nullifies the vow that obligates her or the rash promise by which she obligates herself, and the  Lord  will release her. "
"4658","Numbers","30","9","“Any vow or obligation taken by a widow or divorced woman will be binding on her. "
"4659","Numbers","30","10","“If a woman living with her husband makes a vow or obligates herself by a pledge under oath  "

"4662","Numbers","30","13","Her husband may confirm or nullify any vow she makes or any sworn pledge to deny herself.   "
"4663","Numbers","30","14","But if her husband says nothing to her about it from day to day, then he confirms all her vows or the pledges binding on her. He confirms them by saying nothing to her when he hears about them.  "
"4664","Numbers","30","15","If, however, he nullifies them some time after he hears about them, then he must bear the consequences of her wrongdoing.” "
"4665","Numbers","30","16","These are the regulations the  Lord  gave Moses concerning relationships between a man and his wife, and between a father and his young daughter still living at home."
"4666","Numbers","31","1","The  Lord  said to Moses,  "
"4667","Numbers","31","2","“Take vengeance on the Midianites for the Israelites. After that, you will be gathered to your people.” "
"4668","Numbers","31","3","So Moses said to the people, “Arm some of your men to go to war against the Midianites so that they may carry out the  Lord ’s vengeance on them.  "

"4670","Numbers","31","5","So twelve thousand men armed for battle, a thousand from each tribe, were supplied from the clans of Israel.  "
"4671","Numbers","31","6","Moses sent them into battle, a thousand from each tribe, along with Phinehas son of Eleazar, the priest, who took with him articles from the sanctuary and the trumpets for signaling. "
"4672","Numbers","31","7","They fought against Midian, as the  Lord  commanded Moses, and killed every man.  "
"4673","Numbers","31","8","Among their victims were Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur and Reba—the five kings of Midian. They also killed Balaam son of Beor with the sword.  "
"4674","Numbers","31","9","The Israelites captured the Midianite women and children and took all the Midianite herds, flocks and goods as plunder.  "
"4675","Numbers","31","10","They burned all the towns where the Midianites had settled, as well as all their camps.  "
"4676","Numbers","31","11","They took all the plunder and spoils, including the people and animals,  "
"4677","Numbers","31","12","and brought the captives, spoils and plunder to Moses and Eleazar the priest and the Israelite assembly at their camp on the plains of Moab, by the Jordan across from Jericho. "
"4678","Numbers","31","13","Moses, Eleazar the priest and all the leaders of the community went to meet them outside the camp.  "
"4679","Numbers","31","14","Moses was angry with the officers of the army—the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds—who returned from the battle. "
"4680","Numbers","31","15","“Have you allowed all the women to live?” he asked them.  "
"4681","Numbers","31","16","“They were the ones who followed Balaam’s advice and enticed the Israelites to be unfaithful to the  Lord  in the Peor incident, so that a plague struck the  Lord ’s people.  "
"4682","Numbers","31","17","Now kill all the boys. And kill every woman who has slept with a man,  "

"4684","Numbers","31","19","“Anyone who has killed someone or touched someone who was killed must stay outside the camp seven days. On the third and seventh days you must purify yourselves and your captives.  "
"4685","Numbers","31","20","Purify every garment as well as everything made of leather, goat hair or wood.” "
"4686","Numbers","31","21","Then Eleazar the priest said to the soldiers who had gone into battle, “This is what is required by the law that the  Lord  gave Moses:  "
"4687","Numbers","31","22","Gold, silver, bronze, iron, tin, lead  "
"4688","Numbers","31","23","and anything else that can withstand fire must be put through the fire, and then it will be clean. But it must also be purified with the water of cleansing. And whatever cannot withstand fire must be put through that water.  "
"4689","Numbers","31","24","On the seventh day wash your clothes and you will be clean. Then you may come into the camp.” "
"4690","Numbers","31","25","The  Lord  said to Moses,  "

"4692","Numbers","31","27","Divide the spoils equally between the soldiers who took part in the battle and the rest of the community.  "
"4693","Numbers","31","28","From the soldiers who fought in the battle, set apart as tribute for the  Lord  one out of every five hundred, whether people, cattle, donkeys or sheep.  "
"4694","Numbers","31","29","Take this tribute from their half share and give it to Eleazar the priest as the  Lord ’s part.  "
"4695","Numbers","31","30","From the Israelites’ half, select one out of every fifty, whether people, cattle, donkeys, sheep or other animals. Give them to the Levites, who are responsible for the care of the  Lord ’s tabernacle.”  "
"4696","Numbers","31","31","So Moses and Eleazar the priest did as the  Lord  commanded Moses. "
"4697","Numbers","31","32","The plunder remaining from the spoils that the soldiers took was 675,000 sheep,  "
"4698","Numbers","31","33","72,000 cattle,  "
"4699","Numbers","31","34","61,000 donkeys  "
"4700","Numbers","31","35","and 32,000 women who had never slept with a man. "
"4701","Numbers","31","36","The half share of those who fought in the battle was: 337,500 sheep,  "
"4702","Numbers","31","37","of which the tribute for the  Lord  was 675; "
"4703","Numbers","31","38","36,000 cattle, of which the tribute for the  Lord  was 72; "
"4704","Numbers","31","39","30,500 donkeys, of which the tribute for the  Lord  was 61; "
"4705","Numbers","31","40","16,000 people, of whom the tribute for the  Lord  was 32. "
"4706","Numbers","31","41","Moses gave the tribute to Eleazar the priest as the  Lord ’s part, as the  Lord  commanded Moses. "
"4707","Numbers","31","42","The half belonging to the Israelites, which Moses set apart from that of the fighting men—  "
"4708","Numbers","31","43","the community’s half—was 337,500 sheep,  "
"4709","Numbers","31","44","36,000 cattle,  "
"4710","Numbers","31","45","30,500 donkeys  "
"4711","Numbers","31","46","and 16,000 people.  "
"4712","Numbers","31","47","From the Israelites’ half, Moses selected one out of every fifty people and animals, as the  Lord  commanded him, and gave them to the Levites, who were responsible for the care of the  Lord ’s tabernacle. "
"4713","Numbers","31","48","Then the officers who were over the units of the army—the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds—went to Moses  "
"4714","Numbers","31","49","and said to him, “Your servants have counted the soldiers under our command, and not one is missing.  "
"4715","Numbers","31","50","So we have brought as an offering to the  Lord  the gold articles each of us acquired—armlets, bracelets, signet rings, earrings and necklaces—to make atonement for ourselves before the  Lord .” "
"4716","Numbers","31","51","Moses and Eleazar the priest accepted from them the gold—all the crafted articles.  "
"4717","Numbers","31","52","All the gold from the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds that Moses and Eleazar presented as a gift to the  Lord  weighed 16,750 shekels.   "
"4718","Numbers","31","53","Each soldier had taken plunder for himself.  "
"4719","Numbers","31","54","Moses and Eleazar the priest accepted the gold from the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds and brought it into the tent of meeting as a memorial for the Israelites before the  Lord ."
"4720","Numbers","32","1","The Reubenites and Gadites, who had very large herds and flocks, saw that the lands of Jazer and Gilead were suitable for livestock.  "
"4721","Numbers","32","2","So they came to Moses and Eleazar the priest and to the leaders of the community, and said,  "
"4722","Numbers","32","3","“Ataroth, Dibon, Jazer, Nimrah, Heshbon, Elealeh, Sebam, Nebo and Beon—  "
"4723","Numbers","32","4","the land the  Lord  subdued before the people of Israel—are suitable for livestock, and your servants have livestock.  "
"4724","Numbers","32","5","If we have found favor in your eyes,” they said, “let this land be given to your servants as our possession. Do not make us cross the Jordan.” "
"4725","Numbers","32","6","Moses said to the Gadites and Reubenites, “Should your fellow Israelites go to war while you sit here?  "
"4726","Numbers","32","7","Why do you discourage the Israelites from crossing over into the land the  Lord  has given them?  "
"4727","Numbers","32","8","This is what your fathers did when I sent them from Kadesh Barnea to look over the land.  "
"4728","Numbers","32","9","After they went up to the Valley of Eshkol and viewed the land, they discouraged the Israelites from entering the land the  Lord  had given them.  "
"4729","Numbers","32","10","The  Lord ’s anger was aroused that day and he swore this oath:  "
"4730","Numbers","32","11","‘Because they have not followed me wholeheartedly, not one of those who were twenty years old or more when they came up out of Egypt will see the land I promised on oath to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob—  "
"4731","Numbers","32","12","not one except Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite and Joshua son of Nun, for they followed the  Lord  wholeheartedly.’  "
"4732","Numbers","32","13","The  Lord ’s anger burned against Israel and he made them wander in the wilderness forty years, until the whole generation of those who had done evil in his sight was gone. "
"4733","Numbers","32","14","“And here you are, a brood of sinners, standing in the place of your fathers and making the  Lord  even more angry with Israel.  "
"4734","Numbers","32","15","If you turn away from following him, he will again leave all this people in the wilderness, and you will be the cause of their destruction.” "
"4735","Numbers","32","16","Then they came up to him and said, “We would like to build pens here for our livestock and cities for our women and children.  "
"4736","Numbers","32","17","But we will arm ourselves for battle  and go ahead of the Israelites until we have brought them to their place. Meanwhile our women and children will live in fortified cities, for protection from the inhabitants of the land.  "
"4737","Numbers","32","18","We will not return to our homes until each of the Israelites has received their inheritance.  "
"4738","Numbers","32","19","We will not receive any inheritance with them on the other side of the Jordan, because our inheritance has come to us on the east side of the Jordan.” "
"4739","Numbers","32","20","Then Moses said to them, “If you will do this—if you will arm yourselves before the  Lord  for battle  "
"4740","Numbers","32","21","and if all of you who are armed cross over the Jordan before the  Lord  until he has driven his enemies out before him—  "
"4741","Numbers","32","22","then when the land is subdued before the  Lord , you may return and be free from your obligation to the  Lord  and to Israel. And this land will be your possession before the  Lord . "
"4742","Numbers","32","23","“But if you fail to do this, you will be sinning against the  Lord ; and you may be sure that your sin will find you out.  "
"4743","Numbers","32","24","Build cities for your women and children, and pens for your flocks, but do what you have promised.” "
"4744","Numbers","32","25","The Gadites and Reubenites said to Moses, “We your servants will do as our lord commands.  "
"4745","Numbers","32","26","Our children and wives, our flocks and herds will remain here in the cities of Gilead.  "
"4746","Numbers","32","27","But your servants, every man who is armed for battle, will cross over to fight before the  Lord , just as our lord says.” "
"4747","Numbers","32","28","Then Moses gave orders about them to Eleazar the priest and Joshua son of Nun and to the family heads of the Israelite tribes.  "
"4748","Numbers","32","29","He said to them, “If the Gadites and Reubenites, every man armed for battle, cross over the Jordan with you before the  Lord , then when the land is subdued before you, you must give them the land of Gilead as their possession.  "
"4749","Numbers","32","30","But if they do not cross over with you armed, they must accept their possession with you in Canaan.” "
"4750","Numbers","32","31","The Gadites and Reubenites answered, “Your servants will do what the  Lord  has said.  "
"4751","Numbers","32","32","We will cross over before the  Lord  into Canaan armed, but the property we inherit will be on this side of the Jordan.” "
"4752","Numbers","32","33","Then Moses gave to the Gadites, the Reubenites and the half-tribe of Manasseh son of Joseph the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan—the whole land with its cities and the territory around them. "
"4753","Numbers","32","34","The Gadites built up Dibon, Ataroth, Aroer,  "
"4754","Numbers","32","35","Atroth Shophan, Jazer, Jogbehah,  "
"4755","Numbers","32","36","Beth Nimrah and Beth Haran as fortified cities, and built pens for their flocks.  "
"4756","Numbers","32","37","And the Reubenites rebuilt Heshbon, Elealeh and Kiriathaim,  "
"4757","Numbers","32","38","as well as Nebo and Baal Meon (these names were changed) and Sibmah. They gave names to the cities they rebuilt. "
"4758","Numbers","32","39","The descendants of Makir son of Manasseh went to Gilead, captured it and drove out the Amorites who were there.  "
"4759","Numbers","32","40","So Moses gave Gilead to the Makirites, the descendants of Manasseh, and they settled there.  "
"4760","Numbers","32","41","Jair, a descendant of Manasseh, captured their settlements and called them Havvoth Jair.   "
"4761","Numbers","32","42","And Nobah captured Kenath and its surrounding settlements and called it Nobah after himself."
"4762","Numbers","33","1","Here are the stages in the journey of the Israelites when they came out of Egypt by divisions under the leadership of Moses and Aaron. "
"4763","Numbers","33","2","At the Lord’s command Moses recorded the stages in their journey. This is their journey by stages: "
"4764","Numbers","33","3","The Israelites set out from Rameses on the fifteenth day of the first month, the day after the Passover. They marched out defiantly in full view of all the Egyptians, "
"4765","Numbers","33","4","who were burying all their firstborn, whom the Lord had struck down among them; for the Lord had brought judgment on their gods. "
"4766","Numbers","33","5","The Israelites left Rameses and camped at Sukkoth. "
"4767","Numbers","33","6","They left Sukkoth and camped at Etham, on the edge of the desert. "
"4768","Numbers","33","7","They left Etham, turned back to Pi Hahiroth, to the east of Baal Zephon, and camped near Migdol. "
"4769","Numbers","33","8","They left Pi Hahiroth33:8 Many manuscripts of the Masoretic Text, Samaritan Pentateuch and Vulgate; most manuscripts of the Masoretic Text left from before Hahiroth and passed through the sea into the desert, and when they had traveled for three days in the Desert of Etham, they camped at Marah. "
"4770","Numbers","33","9","They left Marah and went to Elim, where there were twelve springs and seventy palm trees, and they camped there. "
"4771","Numbers","33","10","They left Elim and camped by the Red Sea.33:10 Or the Sea of Reeds; also in verse 11 "
"4772","Numbers","33","11","They left the Red Sea and camped in the Desert of Sin. "
"4773","Numbers","33","12","They left the Desert of Sin and camped at Dophkah. "
"4774","Numbers","33","13","They left Dophkah and camped at Alush. "
"4775","Numbers","33","14","They left Alush and camped at Rephidim, where there was no water for the people to drink. "
"4776","Numbers","33","15","They left Rephidim and camped in the Desert of Sinai. "
"4777","Numbers","33","16","They left the Desert of Sinai and camped at Kibroth Hattaavah. "
"4778","Numbers","33","17","They left Kibroth Hattaavah and camped at Hazeroth. "
"4779","Numbers","33","18","They left Hazeroth and camped at Rithmah. "

"4854","Numbers","35","8","The towns you give the Levites from the land the Israelites possess are to be given in proportion to the inheritance of each tribe: Take many towns from a tribe that has many, but few from one that has few.” "

"4859","Numbers","35","13","These six towns you give will be your cities of refuge.  "
"4860","Numbers","35","14","Give three on this side of the Jordan and three in Canaan as cities of refuge.  "
"4861","Numbers","35","15","These six towns will be a place of refuge for Israelites and for foreigners residing among them, so that anyone who has killed another accidentally can flee there. "

"4867","Numbers","35","21","or if out of enmity one person hits another with their fist so that the other dies, that person is to be put to death; that person is a murderer. The avenger of blood shall put the murderer to death when they meet. "
"4868","Numbers","35","22","“ ‘But if without enmity someone suddenly pushes another or throws something at them unintentionally  "

"4870","Numbers","35","24","the assembly must judge between the accused and the avenger of blood according to these regulations.  "
"4871","Numbers","35","25","The assembly must protect the one accused of murder from the avenger of blood and send the accused back to the city of refuge to which they fled. The accused must stay there until the death of the high priest, who was anointed with the holy oil. "

"4881","Numbers","36","1","The family heads of the clan of Gilead son of Makir, the son of Manasseh, who were from the clans of the descendants of Joseph, came and spoke before Moses and the leaders, the heads of the Israelite families.  "
"4882","Numbers","36","2","They said, “When the  Lord  commanded my lord to give the land as an inheritance to the Israelites by lot, he ordered you to give the inheritance of our brother Zelophehad to his daughters.  "
"4883","Numbers","36","3","Now suppose they marry men from other Israelite tribes; then their inheritance will be taken from our ancestral inheritance and added to that of the tribe they marry into. And so part of the inheritance allotted to us will be taken away.  "
"4884","Numbers","36","4","When the Year of Jubilee for the Israelites comes, their inheritance will be added to that of the tribe into which they marry, and their property will be taken from the tribal inheritance of our ancestors.” "
"4885","Numbers","36","5","Then at the  Lord ’s command Moses gave this order to the Israelites: “What the tribe of the descendants of Joseph is saying is right.  "
"4886","Numbers","36","6","This is what the  Lord  commands for Zelophehad’s daughters: They may marry anyone they please as long as they marry within their father’s tribal clan.  "
"4887","Numbers","36","7","No inheritance in Israel is to pass from one tribe to another, for every Israelite shall keep the tribal inheritance of their ancestors.  "
"4888","Numbers","36","8","Every daughter who inherits land in any Israelite tribe must marry someone in her father’s tribal clan, so that every Israelite will possess the inheritance of their ancestors.  "
"4889","Numbers","36","9","No inheritance may pass from one tribe to another, for each Israelite tribe is to keep the land it inherits.” "
"4890","Numbers","36","10","So Zelophehad’s daughters did as the  Lord  commanded Moses.  "
"4891","Numbers","36","11","Zelophehad’s daughters—Mahlah, Tirzah, Hoglah, Milkah and Noah—married their cousins on their father’s side.  "
"4892","Numbers","36","12","They married within the clans of the descendants of Manasseh son of Joseph, and their inheritance remained in their father’s tribe and clan. "
"4893","Numbers","36","13","These are the commands and regulations the  Lord  gave through Moses to the Israelites on the plains of Moab by the Jordan across from Jericho."
"4894","Deuteronomy","1","1","These are the words Moses spoke to all Israel in the wilderness east of the Jordan—that is, in the Arabah—opposite Suph, between Paran and Tophel, Laban, Hazeroth and Dizahab.  "
"4895","Deuteronomy","1","2","(It takes eleven days to go from Horeb to Kadesh Barnea by the Mount Seir road.) "
"4896","Deuteronomy","1","3","In the fortieth year, on the first day of the eleventh month, Moses proclaimed to the Israelites all that the  Lord  had commanded him concerning them.  "
"4897","Deuteronomy","1","4","This was after he had defeated Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, and at Edrei had defeated Og king of Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth. "
"4898","Deuteronomy","1","5","East of the Jordan in the territory of Moab, Moses began to expound this law, saying: "
"4899","Deuteronomy","1","6","The  Lord  our God said to us at Horeb, “You have stayed long enough at this mountain.  "
"4900","Deuteronomy","1","7","Break camp and advance into the hill country of the Amorites; go to all the neighboring peoples in the Arabah, in the mountains, in the western foothills, in the Negev and along the coast, to the land of the Canaanites and to Lebanon, as far as the great river, the Euphrates.  "
"4901","Deuteronomy","1","8","See, I have given you this land. Go in and take possession of the land the  Lord  swore he would give to your fathers—to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob—and to their descendants after them.” "
"4902","Deuteronomy","1","9","At that time I said to you, “You are too heavy a burden for me to carry alone.  "
"4903","Deuteronomy","1","10","The  Lord  your God has increased your numbers so that today you are as numerous as the stars in the sky.  "
"4904","Deuteronomy","1","11","May the  Lord , the God of your ancestors, increase you a thousand times and bless you as he has promised!  "
"4905","Deuteronomy","1","12","But how can I bear your problems and your burdens and your disputes all by myself?  "
"4906","Deuteronomy","1","13","Choose some wise, understanding and respected men from each of your tribes, and I will set them over you.” "
"4907","Deuteronomy","1","14","You answered me, “What you propose to do is good.” "
"4908","Deuteronomy","1","15","So I took the leading men of your tribes, wise and respected men, and appointed them to have authority over you—as commanders of thousands, of hundreds, of fifties and of tens and as tribal officials.  "
"4909","Deuteronomy","1","16","And I charged your judges at that time, “Hear the disputes between your people and judge fairly, whether the case is between two Israelites or between an Israelite and a foreigner residing among you.  "
"4910","Deuteronomy","1","17","Do not show partiality in judging; hear both small and great alike. Do not be afraid of anyone, for judgment belongs to God. Bring me any case too hard for you, and I will hear it.”  "
"4911","Deuteronomy","1","18","And at that time I told you everything you were to do. "
"4912","Deuteronomy","1","19","Then, as the  Lord  our God commanded us, we set out from Horeb and went toward the hill country of the Amorites through all that vast and dreadful wilderness that you have seen, and so we reached Kadesh Barnea.  "
"4913","Deuteronomy","1","20","Then I said to you, “You have reached the hill country of the Amorites, which the  Lord  our God is giving us.  "
"4914","Deuteronomy","1","21","See, the  Lord  your God has given you the land. Go up and take possession of it as the  Lord , the God of your ancestors, told you. Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged.” "
"4915","Deuteronomy","1","22","Then all of you came to me and said, “Let us send men ahead to spy out the land for us and bring back a report about the route we are to take and the towns we will come to.” "
"4916","Deuteronomy","1","23","The idea seemed good to me; so I selected twelve of you, one man from each tribe.  "
"4917","Deuteronomy","1","24","They left and went up into the hill country, and came to the Valley of Eshkol and explored it.  "
"4918","Deuteronomy","1","25","Taking with them some of the fruit of the land, they brought it down to us and reported, “It is a good land that the  Lord  our God is giving us.” "
"4919","Deuteronomy","1","26","But you were unwilling to go up; you rebelled against the command of the  Lord  your God.  "
"4920","Deuteronomy","1","27","You grumbled in your tents and said, “The  Lord  hates us; so he brought us out of Egypt to deliver us into the hands of the Amorites to destroy us.  "
"4921","Deuteronomy","1","28","Where can we go? Our brothers have made our hearts melt in fear. They say, ‘The people are stronger and taller than we are; the cities are large, with walls up to the sky. We even saw the Anakites there.’ ” "
"4922","Deuteronomy","1","29","Then I said to you, “Do not be terrified; do not be afraid of them.  "
"4923","Deuteronomy","1","30","The  Lord  your God, who is going before you, will fight for you, as he did for you in Egypt, before your very eyes,  "
"4924","Deuteronomy","1","31","and in the wilderness. There you saw how the  Lord  your God carried you, as a father carries his son, all the way you went until you reached this place.” "
"4925","Deuteronomy","1","32","In spite of this, you did not trust in the  Lord  your God,  "
"4926","Deuteronomy","1","33","who went ahead of you on your journey, in fire by night and in a cloud by day, to search out places for you to camp and to show you the way you should go. "
"4927","Deuteronomy","1","34","When the  Lord  heard what you said, he was angry and solemnly swore:  "
"4928","Deuteronomy","1","35","“No one from this evil generation shall see the good land I swore to give your ancestors,  "
"4929","Deuteronomy","1","36","except Caleb son of Jephunneh. He will see it, and I will give him and his descendants the land he set his feet on, because he followed the  Lord  wholeheartedly.” "
"4930","Deuteronomy","1","37","Because of you the  Lord  became angry with me also and said, “You shall not enter it, either.  "
"4931","Deuteronomy","1","38","But your assistant, Joshua son of Nun, will enter it. Encourage him, because he will lead Israel to inherit it.  "
"4932","Deuteronomy","1","39","And the little ones that you said would be taken captive, your children who do not yet know good from bad—they will enter the land. I will give it to them and they will take possession of it.  "
"4933","Deuteronomy","1","40","But as for you, turn around and set out toward the desert along the route to the Red Sea. ” "
"4934","Deuteronomy","1","41","Then you replied, “We have sinned against the  Lord . We will go up and fight, as the  Lord  our God commanded us.” So every one of you put on his weapons, thinking it easy to go up into the hill country. "
"4935","Deuteronomy","1","42","But the  Lord  said to me, “Tell them, ‘Do not go up and fight, because I will not be with you. You will be defeated by your enemies.’ ” "
"4936","Deuteronomy","1","43","So I told you, but you would not listen. You rebelled against the  Lord ’s command and in your arrogance you marched up into the hill country.  "
"4937","Deuteronomy","1","44","The Amorites who lived in those hills came out against you; they chased you like a swarm of bees and beat you down from Seir all the way to Hormah.  "
"4938","Deuteronomy","1","45","You came back and wept before the  Lord , but he paid no attention to your weeping and turned a deaf ear to you.  "
"4939","Deuteronomy","1","46","And so you stayed in Kadesh many days—all the time you spent there."
"4940","Deuteronomy","2","1","Then we turned back and set out toward the wilderness along the route to the Red Sea,  as the  Lord  had directed me. For a long time we made our way around the hill country of Seir. "
"4941","Deuteronomy","2","2","Then the  Lord  said to me,  "
"4942","Deuteronomy","2","3","“You have made your way around this hill country long enough; now turn north.  "
"4943","Deuteronomy","2","4","Give the people these orders: ‘You are about to pass through the territory of your relatives the descendants of Esau, who live in Seir. They will be afraid of you, but be very careful.  "
"4944","Deuteronomy","2","5","Do not provoke them to war, for I will not give you any of their land, not even enough to put your foot on. I have given Esau the hill country of Seir as his own.  "
"4945","Deuteronomy","2","6","You are to pay them in silver for the food you eat and the water you drink.’ ” "
"4946","Deuteronomy","2","7","The  Lord  your God has blessed you in all the work of your hands. He has watched over your journey through this vast wilderness. These forty years the  Lord  your God has been with you, and you have not lacked anything. "
"4947","Deuteronomy","2","8","So we went on past our relatives the descendants of Esau, who live in Seir. We turned from the Arabah road, which comes up from Elath and Ezion Geber, and traveled along the desert road of Moab. "
"4948","Deuteronomy","2","9","Then the  Lord  said to me, “Do not harass the Moabites or provoke them to war, for I will not give you any part of their land. I have given Ar to the descendants of Lot as a possession.” "
"4949","Deuteronomy","2","10","(The Emites used to live there—a people strong and numerous, and as tall as the Anakites.  "
"4950","Deuteronomy","2","11","Like the Anakites, they too were considered Rephaites, but the Moabites called them Emites.  "
"4951","Deuteronomy","2","12","Horites used to live in Seir, but the descendants of Esau drove them out. They destroyed the Horites from before them and settled in their place, just as Israel did in the land the  Lord  gave them as their possession.) "
"4952","Deuteronomy","2","13","And the  Lord  said, “Now get up and cross the Zered Valley.” So we crossed the valley. "
"4953","Deuteronomy","2","14","Thirty-eight years passed from the time we left Kadesh Barnea until we crossed the Zered Valley. By then, that entire generation of fighting men had perished from the camp, as the  Lord  had sworn to them.  "
"4954","Deuteronomy","2","15","The  Lord ’s hand was against them until he had completely eliminated them from the camp. "
"4955","Deuteronomy","2","16","Now when the last of these fighting men among the people had died,  "
"4956","Deuteronomy","2","17","the  Lord  said to me,  "
"4957","Deuteronomy","2","18","“Today you are to pass by the region of Moab at Ar.  "
"4958","Deuteronomy","2","19","When you come to the Ammonites, do not harass them or provoke them to war, for I will not give you possession of any land belonging to the Ammonites. I have given it as a possession to the descendants of Lot.” "
"4959","Deuteronomy","2","20","(That too was considered a land of the Rephaites, who used to live there; but the Ammonites called them Zamzummites.  "
"4960","Deuteronomy","2","21","They were a people strong and numerous, and as tall as the Anakites. The  Lord  destroyed them from before the Ammonites, who drove them out and settled in their place.  "
"4961","Deuteronomy","2","22","The  Lord  had done the same for the descendants of Esau, who lived in Seir, when he destroyed the Horites from before them. They drove them out and have lived in their place to this day.  "
"4962","Deuteronomy","2","23","And as for the Avvites who lived in villages as far as Gaza, the Caphtorites coming out from Caphtor  destroyed them and settled in their place.) "
"4963","Deuteronomy","2","24","“Set out now and cross the Arnon Gorge. See, I have given into your hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his country. Begin to take possession of it and engage him in battle.  "
"4964","Deuteronomy","2","25","This very day I will begin to put the terror and fear of you on all the nations under heaven. They will hear reports of you and will tremble and be in anguish because of you.” "
"4965","Deuteronomy","2","26","From the Desert of Kedemoth I sent messengers to Sihon king of Heshbon offering peace and saying,  "
"4966","Deuteronomy","2","27","“Let us pass through your country. We will stay on the main road; we will not turn aside to the right or to the left.  "
"4967","Deuteronomy","2","28","Sell us food to eat and water to drink for their price in silver. Only let us pass through on foot—  "
"4968","Deuteronomy","2","29","as the descendants of Esau, who live in Seir, and the Moabites, who live in Ar, did for us—until we cross the Jordan into the land the  Lord  our God is giving us.”  "
"4969","Deuteronomy","2","30","But Sihon king of Heshbon refused to let us pass through. For the  Lord  your God had made his spirit stubborn and his heart obstinate in order to give him into your hands, as he has now done. "
"4970","Deuteronomy","2","31","The  Lord  said to me, “See, I have begun to deliver Sihon and his country over to you. Now begin to conquer and possess his land.” "
"4971","Deuteronomy","2","32","When Sihon and all his army came out to meet us in battle at Jahaz,  "
"4972","Deuteronomy","2","33","the  Lord  our God delivered him over to us and we struck him down, together with his sons and his whole army.  "
"4973","Deuteronomy","2","34","At that time we took all his towns and completely destroyed  them—men, women and children. We left no survivors.  "
"4974","Deuteronomy","2","35","But the livestock and the plunder from the towns we had captured we carried off for ourselves.  "
"4975","Deuteronomy","2","36","From Aroer on the rim of the Arnon Gorge, and from the town in the gorge, even as far as Gilead, not one town was too strong for us. The  Lord  our God gave us all of them.  "
"4976","Deuteronomy","2","37","But in accordance with the command of the  Lord  our God, you did not encroach on any of the land of the Ammonites, neither the land along the course of the Jabbok nor that around the towns in the hills."
"4977","Deuteronomy","3","1","Next we turned and went up along the road toward Bashan, and Og king of Bashan with his whole army marched out to meet us in battle at Edrei.  "
"4978","Deuteronomy","3","2","The  Lord  said to me, “Do not be afraid of him, for I have delivered him into your hands, along with his whole army and his land. Do to him what you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon.” "
"4979","Deuteronomy","3","3","So the  Lord  our God also gave into our hands Og king of Bashan and all his army. We struck them down, leaving no survivors.  "
"4980","Deuteronomy","3","4","At that time we took all his cities. There was not one of the sixty cities that we did not take from them—the whole region of Argob, Og’s kingdom in Bashan.  "
"4981","Deuteronomy","3","5","All these cities were fortified with high walls and with gates and bars, and there were also a great many unwalled villages.  "
"4982","Deuteronomy","3","6","We completely destroyed  them, as we had done with Sihon king of Heshbon, destroying  every city—men, women and children.  "
"4983","Deuteronomy","3","7","But all the livestock and the plunder from their cities we carried off for ourselves. "
"4984","Deuteronomy","3","8","So at that time we took from these two kings of the Amorites the territory east of the Jordan, from the Arnon Gorge as far as Mount Hermon.  "
"4985","Deuteronomy","3","9","(Hermon is called Sirion by the Sidonians; the Amorites call it Senir.)  "
"4986","Deuteronomy","3","10","We took all the towns on the plateau, and all Gilead, and all Bashan as far as Salekah and Edrei, towns of Og’s kingdom in Bashan.  "
"4987","Deuteronomy","3","11","(Og king of Bashan was the last of the Rephaites. His bed was decorated with iron and was more than nine cubits long and four cubits wide.  It is still in Rabbah of the Ammonites.) "
"4988","Deuteronomy","3","12","Of the land that we took over at that time, I gave the Reubenites and the Gadites the territory north of Aroer by the Arnon Gorge, including half the hill country of Gilead, together with its towns.  "
"4989","Deuteronomy","3","13","The rest of Gilead and also all of Bashan, the kingdom of Og, I gave to the half-tribe of Manasseh. (The whole region of Argob in Bashan used to be known as a land of the Rephaites.  "
"4990","Deuteronomy","3","14","Jair, a descendant of Manasseh, took the whole region of Argob as far as the border of the Geshurites and the Maakathites; it was named after him, so that to this day Bashan is called Havvoth Jair. )  "
"4991","Deuteronomy","3","15","And I gave Gilead to Makir.  "
"4992","Deuteronomy","3","16","But to the Reubenites and the Gadites I gave the territory extending from Gilead down to the Arnon Gorge (the middle of the gorge being the border) and out to the Jabbok River, which is the border of the Ammonites.  "
"4993","Deuteronomy","3","17","Its western border was the Jordan in the Arabah, from Kinnereth to the Sea of the Arabah (that is, the Dead Sea), below the slopes of Pisgah. "
"4994","Deuteronomy","3","18","I commanded you at that time: “The  Lord  your God has given you this land to take possession of it. But all your able-bodied men, armed for battle, must cross over ahead of the other Israelites.  "
"4995","Deuteronomy","3","19","However, your wives, your children and your livestock (I know you have much livestock) may stay in the towns I have given you,  "
"4996","Deuteronomy","3","20","until the  Lord  gives rest to your fellow Israelites as he has to you, and they too have taken over the land that the  Lord  your God is giving them across the Jordan. After that, each of you may go back to the possession I have given you.” "
"4997","Deuteronomy","3","21","At that time I commanded Joshua: “You have seen with your own eyes all that the  Lord  your God has done to these two kings. The  Lord  will do the same to all the kingdoms over there where you are going.  "
"4998","Deuteronomy","3","22","Do not be afraid of them; the  Lord  your God himself will fight for you.” "
"4999","Deuteronomy","3","23","At that time I pleaded with the  Lord :  "
"5000","Deuteronomy","3","24","“Sovereign  Lord , you have begun to show to your servant your greatness and your strong hand. For what god is there in heaven or on earth who can do the deeds and mighty works you do?  "
"5001","Deuteronomy","3","25","Let me go over and see the good land beyond the Jordan—that fine hill country and Lebanon.” "
"5002","Deuteronomy","3","26","But because of you the  Lord  was angry with me and would not listen to me. “That is enough,” the  Lord  said. “Do not speak to me anymore about this matter.  "
"5003","Deuteronomy","3","27","Go up to the top of Pisgah and look west and north and south and east. Look at the land with your own eyes, since you are not going to cross this Jordan.  "
"5004","Deuteronomy","3","28","But commission Joshua, and encourage and strengthen him, for he will lead this people across and will cause them to inherit the land that you will see.”  "
"5005","Deuteronomy","3","29","So we stayed in the valley near Beth Peor."
"5006","Deuteronomy","4","1","Now, Israel, hear the decrees and laws I am about to teach you. Follow them so that you may live and may go in and take possession of the land the  Lord , the God of your ancestors, is giving you.  "
"5007","Deuteronomy","4","2","Do not add to what I command you and do not subtract from it, but keep the commands of the  Lord  your God that I give you. "
"5008","Deuteronomy","4","3","You saw with your own eyes what the  Lord  did at Baal Peor. The  Lord  your God destroyed from among you everyone who followed the Baal of Peor,  "
"5009","Deuteronomy","4","4","but all of you who held fast to the  Lord  your God are still alive today. "
"5010","Deuteronomy","4","5","See, I have taught you decrees and laws as the  Lord  my God commanded me, so that you may follow them in the land you are entering to take possession of it.  "
"5011","Deuteronomy","4","6","Observe them carefully, for this will show your wisdom and understanding to the nations, who will hear about all these decrees and say, “Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people.”  "
"5012","Deuteronomy","4","7","What other nation is so great as to have their gods near them the way the  Lord  our God is near us whenever we pray to him?  "
"5013","Deuteronomy","4","8","And what other nation is so great as to have such righteous decrees and laws as this body of laws I am setting before you today? "
"5014","Deuteronomy","4","9","Only be careful, and watch yourselves closely so that you do not forget the things your eyes have seen or let them fade from your heart as long as you live. Teach them to your children and to their children after them.  "
"5015","Deuteronomy","4","10","Remember the day you stood before the  Lord  your God at Horeb, when he said to me, “Assemble the people before me to hear my words so that they may learn to revere me as long as they live in the land and may teach them to their children.”  "
"5016","Deuteronomy","4","11","You came near and stood at the foot of the mountain while it blazed with fire to the very heavens, with black clouds and deep darkness.  "
"5017","Deuteronomy","4","12","Then the  Lord  spoke to you out of the fire. You heard the sound of words but saw no form; there was only a voice.  "
"5018","Deuteronomy","4","13","He declared to you his covenant, the Ten Commandments, which he commanded you to follow and then wrote them on two stone tablets.  "
"5019","Deuteronomy","4","14","And the  Lord  directed me at that time to teach you the decrees and laws you are to follow in the land that you are crossing the Jordan to possess. "
"5020","Deuteronomy","4","15","You saw no form of any kind the day the  Lord  spoke to you at Horeb out of the fire. Therefore watch yourselves very carefully,  "
"5021","Deuteronomy","4","16","so that you do not become corrupt and make for yourselves an idol, an image of any shape, whether formed like a man or a woman,  "
"5022","Deuteronomy","4","17","or like any animal on earth or any bird that flies in the air,  "
"5023","Deuteronomy","4","18","or like any creature that moves along the ground or any fish in the waters below.  "
"5024","Deuteronomy","4","19","And when you look up to the sky and see the sun, the moon and the stars—all the heavenly array—do not be enticed into bowing down to them and worshiping things the  Lord  your God has apportioned to all the nations under heaven.  "
"5025","Deuteronomy","4","20","But as for you, the  Lord  took you and brought you out of the iron-smelting furnace, out of Egypt, to be the people of his inheritance, as you now are. "
"5026","Deuteronomy","4","21","The  Lord  was angry with me because of you, and he solemnly swore that I would not cross the Jordan and enter the good land the  Lord  your God is giving you as your inheritance.  "
"5027","Deuteronomy","4","22","I will die in this land; I will not cross the Jordan; but you are about to cross over and take possession of that good land.  "
"5028","Deuteronomy","4","23","Be careful not to forget the covenant of the  Lord  your God that he made with you; do not make for yourselves an idol in the form of anything the  Lord  your God has forbidden.  "
"5029","Deuteronomy","4","24","For the  Lord  your God is a consuming fire, a jealous God. "
"5030","Deuteronomy","4","25","After you have had children and grandchildren and have lived in the land a long time—if you then become corrupt and make any kind of idol, doing evil in the eyes of the  Lord  your God and arousing his anger,  "
"5031","Deuteronomy","4","26","I call the heavens and the earth as witnesses against you this day that you will quickly perish from the land that you are crossing the Jordan to possess. You will not live there long but will certainly be destroyed.  "
"5032","Deuteronomy","4","27","The  Lord  will scatter you among the peoples, and only a few of you will survive among the nations to which the  Lord  will drive you.  "
"5033","Deuteronomy","4","28","There you will worship man-made gods of wood and stone, which cannot see or hear or eat or smell.  "
"5034","Deuteronomy","4","29","But if from there you seek the  Lord  your God, you will find him if you seek him with all your heart and with all your soul.  "
"5035","Deuteronomy","4","30","When you are in distress and all these things have happened to you, then in later days you will return to the  Lord  your God and obey him.  "
"5036","Deuteronomy","4","31","For the  Lord  your God is a merciful God; he will not abandon or destroy you or forget the covenant with your ancestors, which he confirmed to them by oath. "
"5037","Deuteronomy","4","32","Ask now about the former days, long before your time, from the day God created human beings on the earth; ask from one end of the heavens to the other. Has anything so great as this ever happened, or has anything like it ever been heard of?  "
"5038","Deuteronomy","4","33","Has any other people heard the voice of God  speaking out of fire, as you have, and lived?  "
"5039","Deuteronomy","4","34","Has any god ever tried to take for himself one nation out of another nation, by testings, by signs and wonders, by war, by a mighty hand and an outstretched arm, or by great and awesome deeds, like all the things the  Lord  your God did for you in Egypt before your very eyes? "
"5040","Deuteronomy","4","35","You were shown these things so that you might know that the  Lord  is God; besides him there is no other.  "
"5041","Deuteronomy","4","36","From heaven he made you hear his voice to discipline you. On earth he showed you his great fire, and you heard his words from out of the fire.  "
"5042","Deuteronomy","4","37","Because he loved your ancestors and chose their descendants after them, he brought you out of Egypt by his Presence and his great strength,  "
"5043","Deuteronomy","4","38","to drive out before you nations greater and stronger than you and to bring you into their land to give it to you for your inheritance, as it is today. "
"5044","Deuteronomy","4","39","Acknowledge and take to heart this day that the  Lord  is God in heaven above and on the earth below. There is no other.  "
"5045","Deuteronomy","4","40","Keep his decrees and commands, which I am giving you today, so that it may go well with you and your children after you and that you may live long in the land the  Lord  your God gives you for all time. "
"5046","Deuteronomy","4","41","Then Moses set aside three cities east of the Jordan,  "
"5047","Deuteronomy","4","42","to which anyone who had killed a person could flee if they had unintentionally killed a neighbor without malice aforethought. They could flee into one of these cities and save their life.  "
"5048","Deuteronomy","4","43","The cities were these: Bezer in the wilderness plateau, for the Reubenites; Ramoth in Gilead, for the Gadites; and Golan in Bashan, for the Manassites. "
"5049","Deuteronomy","4","44","This is the law Moses set before the Israelites.  "
"5050","Deuteronomy","4","45","These are the stipulations, decrees and laws Moses gave them when they came out of Egypt  "
"5051","Deuteronomy","4","46","and were in the valley near Beth Peor east of the Jordan, in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon and was defeated by Moses and the Israelites as they came out of Egypt.  "
"5052","Deuteronomy","4","47","They took possession of his land and the land of Og king of Bashan, the two Amorite kings east of the Jordan.  "
"5053","Deuteronomy","4","48","This land extended from Aroer on the rim of the Arnon Gorge to Mount Sirion  (that is, Hermon),  "
"5054","Deuteronomy","4","49","and included all the Arabah east of the Jordan, as far as the Dead Sea,  below the slopes of Pisgah."
"5055","Deuteronomy","5","1","Moses summoned all Israel and said: Hear, Israel, the decrees and laws I declare in your hearing today. Learn them and be sure to follow them.  "
"5056","Deuteronomy","5","2","The  Lord  our God made a covenant with us at Horeb.  "
"5057","Deuteronomy","5","3","It was not with our ancestors  that the  Lord  made this covenant, but with us, with all of us who are alive here today.  "
"5058","Deuteronomy","5","4","The  Lord  spoke to you face to face out of the fire on the mountain.  "
"5059","Deuteronomy","5","5","(At that time I stood between the  Lord  and you to declare to you the word of the  Lord , because you were afraid of the fire and did not go up the mountain.) And he said: "
"5060","Deuteronomy","5","6","“I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery."
"5061","Deuteronomy","5","7","“You shall have no other gods before  me. "
"5062","Deuteronomy","5","8","“You shall not make for yourself an image in the form of anything in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the waters below.  "
"5063","Deuteronomy","5","9","You shall not bow down to them or worship them; for I, the  Lord  your God, am a jealous God, punishing the children for the sin of the parents to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me,  "
"5064","Deuteronomy","5","10","but showing love to a thousand generations of those who love me and keep my commandments. "
"5065","Deuteronomy","5","11","“You shall not misuse the name of the  Lord  your God, for the  Lord  will not hold anyone guiltless who misuses his name. "
"5066","Deuteronomy","5","12","“Observe the Sabbath day by keeping it holy, as the  Lord  your God has commanded you.  "
"5067","Deuteronomy","5","13","Six days you shall labor and do all your work,  "
"5068","Deuteronomy","5","14","but the seventh day is a sabbath to the  Lord  your God. On it you shall not do any work, neither you, nor your son or daughter, nor your male or female servant, nor your ox, your donkey or any of your animals, nor any foreigner residing in your towns, so that your male and female servants may rest, as you do.  "
"5069","Deuteronomy","5","15","Remember that you were slaves in Egypt and that the  Lord  your God brought you out of there with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm. Therefore the  Lord  your God has commanded you to observe the Sabbath day. "
"5070","Deuteronomy","5","16","“Honor your father and your mother, as the  Lord  your God has commanded you, so that you may live long and that it may go well with you in the land the  Lord  your God is giving you. "
"5071","Deuteronomy","5","17","“You shall not murder. "
"5072","Deuteronomy","5","18","“You shall not commit adultery. "
"5073","Deuteronomy","5","19","“You shall not steal. "
"5074","Deuteronomy","5","20","“You shall not give false testimony against your neighbor. "
"5075","Deuteronomy","5","21","“You shall not covet your neighbor’s wife. You shall not set your desire on your neighbor’s house or land, his male or female servant, his ox or donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor.” "
"5076","Deuteronomy","5","22","These are the commandments the  Lord  proclaimed in a loud voice to your whole assembly there on the mountain from out of the fire, the cloud and the deep darkness; and he added nothing more. Then he wrote them on two stone tablets and gave them to me. "
"5077","Deuteronomy","5","23","When you heard the voice out of the darkness, while the mountain was ablaze with fire, all the leaders of your tribes and your elders came to me.  "
"5078","Deuteronomy","5","24","And you said, “The  Lord  our God has shown us his glory and his majesty, and we have heard his voice from the fire. Today we have seen that a person can live even if God speaks with them.  "
"5079","Deuteronomy","5","25","But now, why should we die? This great fire will consume us, and we will die if we hear the voice of the  Lord  our God any longer.  "
"5080","Deuteronomy","5","26","For what mortal has ever heard the voice of the living God speaking out of fire, as we have, and survived?  "
"5081","Deuteronomy","5","27","Go near and listen to all that the  Lord  our God says. Then tell us whatever the  Lord  our God tells you. We will listen and obey.” "
"5082","Deuteronomy","5","28","The  Lord  heard you when you spoke to me, and the  Lord  said to me, “I have heard what this people said to you. Everything they said was good.  "
"5083","Deuteronomy","5","29","Oh, that their hearts would be inclined to fear me and keep all my commands always, so that it might go well with them and their children forever! "
"5084","Deuteronomy","5","30","“Go, tell them to return to their tents.  "
"5085","Deuteronomy","5","31","But you stay here with me so that I may give you all the commands, decrees and laws you are to teach them to follow in the land I am giving them to possess.” "
"5086","Deuteronomy","5","32","So be careful to do what the  Lord  your God has commanded you; do not turn aside to the right or to the left.  "
"5087","Deuteronomy","5","33","Walk in obedience to all that the  Lord  your God has commanded you, so that you may live and prosper and prolong your days in the land that you will possess."
"5088","Deuteronomy","6","1","These are the commands, decrees and laws the  Lord  your God directed me to teach you to observe in the land that you are crossing the Jordan to possess,  "
"5089","Deuteronomy","6","2","so that you, your children and their children after them may fear the  Lord  your God as long as you live by keeping all his decrees and commands that I give you, and so that you may enjoy long life.  "
"5090","Deuteronomy","6","3","Hear, Israel, and be careful to obey so that it may go well with you and that you may increase greatly in a land flowing with milk and honey, just as the  Lord , the God of your ancestors, promised you. "
"5091","Deuteronomy","6","4","Hear, O Israel: The  Lord  our God, the  Lord  is one.   "
"5092","Deuteronomy","6","5","Love the  Lord  your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength.  "
"5093","Deuteronomy","6","6","These commandments that I give you today are to be on your hearts.  "
"5094","Deuteronomy","6","7","Impress them on your children. Talk about them when you sit at home and when you walk along the road, when you lie down and when you get up.  "
"5095","Deuteronomy","6","8","Tie them as symbols on your hands and bind them on your foreheads.  "
"5096","Deuteronomy","6","9","Write them on the doorframes of your houses and on your gates. "
"5097","Deuteronomy","6","10","When the  Lord  your God brings you into the land he swore to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, to give you—a land with large, flourishing cities you did not build,  "
"5098","Deuteronomy","6","11","houses filled with all kinds of good things you did not provide, wells you did not dig, and vineyards and olive groves you did not plant—then when you eat and are satisfied,  "
"5099","Deuteronomy","6","12","be careful that you do not forget the  Lord , who brought you out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery. "
"5100","Deuteronomy","6","13","Fear the  Lord  your God, serve him only and take your oaths in his name.  "
"5101","Deuteronomy","6","14","Do not follow other gods, the gods of the peoples around you;  "
"5102","Deuteronomy","6","15","for the  Lord  your God, who is among you, is a jealous God and his anger will burn against you, and he will destroy you from the face of the land.  "
"5103","Deuteronomy","6","16","Do not put the  Lord  your God to the test as you did at Massah.  "
"5104","Deuteronomy","6","17","Be sure to keep the commands of the  Lord  your God and the stipulations and decrees he has given you.  "
"5105","Deuteronomy","6","18","Do what is right and good in the  Lord ’s sight, so that it may go well with you and you may go in and take over the good land the  Lord  promised on oath to your ancestors,  "
"5106","Deuteronomy","6","19","thrusting out all your enemies before you, as the  Lord  said. "
"5107","Deuteronomy","6","20","In the future, when your son asks you, “What is the meaning of the stipulations, decrees and laws the  Lord  our God has commanded you?”  "
"5108","Deuteronomy","6","21","tell him: “We were slaves of Pharaoh in Egypt, but the  Lord  brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand.  "
"5109","Deuteronomy","6","22","Before our eyes the  Lord  sent signs and wonders—great and terrible—on Egypt and Pharaoh and his whole household.  "
"5110","Deuteronomy","6","23","But he brought us out from there to bring us in and give us the land he promised on oath to our ancestors.  "
"5111","Deuteronomy","6","24","The  Lord  commanded us to obey all these decrees and to fear the  Lord  our God, so that we might always prosper and be kept alive, as is the case today.  "
"5112","Deuteronomy","6","25","And if we are careful to obey all this law before the  Lord  our God, as he has commanded us, that will be our righteousness.”"
"5113","Deuteronomy","7","1","When the  Lord  your God brings you into the land you are entering to possess and drives out before you many nations—the Hittites, Girgashites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites, seven nations larger and stronger than you—  "
"5114","Deuteronomy","7","2","and when the  Lord  your God has delivered them over to you and you have defeated them, then you must destroy them totally.  Make no treaty with them, and show them no mercy.  "
"5115","Deuteronomy","7","3","Do not intermarry with them. Do not give your daughters to their sons or take their daughters for your sons,  "
"5116","Deuteronomy","7","4","for they will turn your children away from following me to serve other gods, and the  Lord ’s anger will burn against you and will quickly destroy you.  "
"5117","Deuteronomy","7","5","This is what you are to do to them: Break down their altars, smash their sacred stones, cut down their Asherah poles  and burn their idols in the fire.  "
"5118","Deuteronomy","7","6","For you are a people holy to the  Lord  your God. The  Lord  your God has chosen you out of all the peoples on the face of the earth to be his people, his treasured possession. "
"5119","Deuteronomy","7","7","The  Lord  did not set his affection on you and choose you because you were more numerous than other peoples, for you were the fewest of all peoples.  "
"5120","Deuteronomy","7","8","But it was because the  Lord  loved you and kept the oath he swore to your ancestors that he brought you out with a mighty hand and redeemed you from the land of slavery, from the power of Pharaoh king of Egypt.  "
"5121","Deuteronomy","7","9","Know therefore that the  Lord  your God is God; he is the faithful God, keeping his covenant of love to a thousand generations of those who love him and keep his commandments.  "
"5122","Deuteronomy","7","10","But those who hate him he will repay to their face by destruction; he will not be slow to repay to their face those who hate him. "
"5123","Deuteronomy","7","11","Therefore, take care to follow the commands, decrees and laws I give you today. "
"5124","Deuteronomy","7","12","If you pay attention to these laws and are careful to follow them, then the  Lord  your God will keep his covenant of love with you, as he swore to your ancestors.  "
"5125","Deuteronomy","7","13","He will love you and bless you and increase your numbers. He will bless the fruit of your womb, the crops of your land—your grain, new wine and olive oil—the calves of your herds and the lambs of your flocks in the land he swore to your ancestors to give you.  "
"5126","Deuteronomy","7","14","You will be blessed more than any other people; none of your men or women will be childless, nor will any of your livestock be without young.  "
"5127","Deuteronomy","7","15","The  Lord  will keep you free from every disease. He will not inflict on you the horrible diseases you knew in Egypt, but he will inflict them on all who hate you.  "
"5128","Deuteronomy","7","16","You must destroy all the peoples the  Lord  your God gives over to you. Do not look on them with pity and do not serve their gods, for that will be a snare to you. "
"5129","Deuteronomy","7","17","You may say to yourselves, “These nations are stronger than we are. How can we drive them out?”  "
"5130","Deuteronomy","7","18","But do not be afraid of them; remember well what the  Lord  your God did to Pharaoh and to all Egypt.  "
"5131","Deuteronomy","7","19","You saw with your own eyes the great trials, the signs and wonders, the mighty hand and outstretched arm, with which the  Lord  your God brought you out. The  Lord  your God will do the same to all the peoples you now fear.  "
"5132","Deuteronomy","7","20","Moreover, the  Lord  your God will send the hornet among them until even the survivors who hide from you have perished.  "
"5133","Deuteronomy","7","21","Do not be terrified by them, for the  Lord  your God, who is among you, is a great and awesome God.  "
"5134","Deuteronomy","7","22","The  Lord  your God will drive out those nations before you, little by little. You will not be allowed to eliminate them all at once, or the wild animals will multiply around you.  "
"5135","Deuteronomy","7","23","But the  Lord  your God will deliver them over to you, throwing them into great confusion until they are destroyed.  "
"5136","Deuteronomy","7","24","He will give their kings into your hand, and you will wipe out their names from under heaven. No one will be able to stand up against you; you will destroy them.  "
"5137","Deuteronomy","7","25","The images of their gods you are to burn in the fire. Do not covet the silver and gold on them, and do not take it for yourselves, or you will be ensnared by it, for it is detestable to the  Lord  your God.  "
"5138","Deuteronomy","7","26","Do not bring a detestable thing into your house or you, like it, will be set apart for destruction. Regard it as vile and utterly detest it, for it is set apart for destruction."
"5139","Deuteronomy","8","1","Be careful to follow every command I am giving you today, so that you may live and increase and may enter and possess the land the  Lord  promised on oath to your ancestors.  "
"5140","Deuteronomy","8","2","Remember how the  Lord  your God led you all the way in the wilderness these forty years, to humble and test you in order to know what was in your heart, whether or not you would keep his commands.  "
"5141","Deuteronomy","8","3","He humbled you, causing you to hunger and then feeding you with manna, which neither you nor your ancestors had known, to teach you that man does not live on bread alone but on every word that comes from the mouth of the  Lord .  "
"5142","Deuteronomy","8","4","Your clothes did not wear out and your feet did not swell during these forty years.  "
"5143","Deuteronomy","8","5","Know then in your heart that as a man disciplines his son, so the  Lord  your God disciplines you. "
"5144","Deuteronomy","8","6","Observe the commands of the  Lord  your God, walking in obedience to him and revering him.  "
"5145","Deuteronomy","8","7","For the  Lord  your God is bringing you into a good land—a land with brooks, streams, and deep springs gushing out into the valleys and hills;  "
"5146","Deuteronomy","8","8","a land with wheat and barley, vines and fig trees, pomegranates, olive oil and honey;  "
"5147","Deuteronomy","8","9","a land where bread will not be scarce and you will lack nothing; a land where the rocks are iron and you can dig copper out of the hills. "
"5148","Deuteronomy","8","10","When you have eaten and are satisfied, praise the  Lord  your God for the good land he has given you.  "
"5149","Deuteronomy","8","11","Be careful that you do not forget the  Lord  your God, failing to observe his commands, his laws and his decrees that I am giving you this day.  "
"5150","Deuteronomy","8","12","Otherwise, when you eat and are satisfied, when you build fine houses and settle down,  "
"5151","Deuteronomy","8","13","and when your herds and flocks grow large and your silver and gold increase and all you have is multiplied,  "
"5152","Deuteronomy","8","14","then your heart will become proud and you will forget the  Lord  your God, who brought you out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery.  "
"5153","Deuteronomy","8","15","He led you through the vast and dreadful wilderness, that thirsty and waterless land, with its venomous snakes and scorpions. He brought you water out of hard rock.  "
"5154","Deuteronomy","8","16","He gave you manna to eat in the wilderness, something your ancestors had never known, to humble and test you so that in the end it might go well with you.  "
"5155","Deuteronomy","8","17","You may say to yourself, “My power and the strength of my hands have produced this wealth for me.”  "
"5156","Deuteronomy","8","18","But remember the  Lord  your God, for it is he who gives you the ability to produce wealth, and so confirms his covenant, which he swore to your ancestors, as it is today. "
"5157","Deuteronomy","8","19","If you ever forget the  Lord  your God and follow other gods and worship and bow down to them, I testify against you today that you will surely be destroyed.  "
"5158","Deuteronomy","8","20","Like the nations the  Lord  destroyed before you, so you will be destroyed for not obeying the  Lord  your God."
"5159","Deuteronomy","9","1","Hear, Israel: You are now about to cross the Jordan to go in and dispossess nations greater and stronger than you, with large cities that have walls up to the sky.  "
"5160","Deuteronomy","9","2","The people are strong and tall—Anakites! You know about them and have heard it said: “Who can stand up against the Anakites?”  "
"5161","Deuteronomy","9","3","But be assured today that the  Lord  your God is the one who goes across ahead of you like a devouring fire. He will destroy them; he will subdue them before you. And you will drive them out and annihilate them quickly, as the  Lord  has promised you. "
"5162","Deuteronomy","9","4","After the  Lord  your God has driven them out before you, do not say to yourself, “The  Lord  has brought me here to take possession of this land because of my righteousness.” No, it is on account of the wickedness of these nations that the  Lord  is going to drive them out before you.  "
"5163","Deuteronomy","9","5","It is not because of your righteousness or your integrity that you are going in to take possession of their land; but on account of the wickedness of these nations, the  Lord  your God will drive them out before you, to accomplish what he swore to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.  "
"5164","Deuteronomy","9","6","Understand, then, that it is not because of your righteousness that the  Lord  your God is giving you this good land to possess, for you are a stiff-necked people. "
"5165","Deuteronomy","9","7","Remember this and never forget how you aroused the anger of the  Lord  your God in the wilderness. From the day you left Egypt until you arrived here, you have been rebellious against the  Lord .  "
"5166","Deuteronomy","9","8","At Horeb you aroused the  Lord ’s wrath so that he was angry enough to destroy you.  "
"5167","Deuteronomy","9","9","When I went up on the mountain to receive the tablets of stone, the tablets of the covenant that the  Lord  had made with you, I stayed on the mountain forty days and forty nights; I ate no bread and drank no water.  "
"5168","Deuteronomy","9","10","The  Lord  gave me two stone tablets inscribed by the finger of God. On them were all the commandments the  Lord  proclaimed to you on the mountain out of the fire, on the day of the assembly. "
"5169","Deuteronomy","9","11","At the end of the forty days and forty nights, the  Lord  gave me the two stone tablets, the tablets of the covenant.  "
"5170","Deuteronomy","9","12","Then the  Lord  told me, “Go down from here at once, because your people whom you brought out of Egypt have become corrupt. They have turned away quickly from what I commanded them and have made an idol for themselves.” "
"5171","Deuteronomy","9","13","And the  Lord  said to me, “I have seen this people, and they are a stiff-necked people indeed!  "
"5172","Deuteronomy","9","14","Let me alone, so that I may destroy them and blot out their name from under heaven. And I will make you into a nation stronger and more numerous than they.” "
"5173","Deuteronomy","9","15","So I turned and went down from the mountain while it was ablaze with fire. And the two tablets of the covenant were in my hands.  "
"5174","Deuteronomy","9","16","When I looked, I saw that you had sinned against the  Lord  your God; you had made for yourselves an idol cast in the shape of a calf. You had turned aside quickly from the way that the  Lord  had commanded you.  "
"5175","Deuteronomy","9","17","So I took the two tablets and threw them out of my hands, breaking them to pieces before your eyes. "
"5176","Deuteronomy","9","18","Then once again I fell prostrate before the  Lord  for forty days and forty nights; I ate no bread and drank no water, because of all the sin you had committed, doing what was evil in the  Lord ’s sight and so arousing his anger.  "
"5177","Deuteronomy","9","19","I feared the anger and wrath of the  Lord , for he was angry enough with you to destroy you. But again the  Lord  listened to me.  "
"5178","Deuteronomy","9","20","And the  Lord  was angry enough with Aaron to destroy him, but at that time I prayed for Aaron too.  "
"5179","Deuteronomy","9","21","Also I took that sinful thing of yours, the calf you had made, and burned it in the fire. Then I crushed it and ground it to powder as fine as dust and threw the dust into a stream that flowed down the mountain. "
"5180","Deuteronomy","9","22","You also made the  Lord  angry at Taberah, at Massah and at Kibroth Hattaavah. "
"5181","Deuteronomy","9","23","And when the  Lord  sent you out from Kadesh Barnea, he said, “Go up and take possession of the land I have given you.” But you rebelled against the command of the  Lord  your God. You did not trust him or obey him.  "
"5182","Deuteronomy","9","24","You have been rebellious against the  Lord  ever since I have known you. "
"5183","Deuteronomy","9","25","I lay prostrate before the  Lord  those forty days and forty nights because the  Lord  had said he would destroy you.  "
"5184","Deuteronomy","9","26","I prayed to the  Lord  and said, “Sovereign  Lord , do not destroy your people, your own inheritance that you redeemed by your great power and brought out of Egypt with a mighty hand.  "
"5185","Deuteronomy","9","27","Remember your servants Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. Overlook the stubbornness of this people, their wickedness and their sin.  "
"5186","Deuteronomy","9","28","Otherwise, the country from which you brought us will say, ‘Because the  Lord  was not able to take them into the land he had promised them, and because he hated them, he brought them out to put them to death in the wilderness.’  "
"5187","Deuteronomy","9","29","But they are your people, your inheritance that you brought out by your great power and your outstretched arm.”"
"5188","Deuteronomy","10","1","At that time the  Lord  said to me, “Chisel out two stone tablets like the first ones and come up to me on the mountain. Also make a wooden ark.   "
"5189","Deuteronomy","10","2","I will write on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets, which you broke. Then you are to put them in the ark.” "
"5190","Deuteronomy","10","3","So I made the ark out of acacia wood and chiseled out two stone tablets like the first ones, and I went up on the mountain with the two tablets in my hands.  "
"5191","Deuteronomy","10","4","The  Lord  wrote on these tablets what he had written before, the Ten Commandments he had proclaimed to you on the mountain, out of the fire, on the day of the assembly. And the  Lord  gave them to me.  "
"5192","Deuteronomy","10","5","Then I came back down the mountain and put the tablets in the ark I had made, as the  Lord  commanded me, and they are there now. "
"5193","Deuteronomy","10","6","(The Israelites traveled from the wells of Bene Jaakan to Moserah. There Aaron died and was buried, and Eleazar his son succeeded him as priest.  "
"5194","Deuteronomy","10","7","From there they traveled to Gudgodah and on to Jotbathah, a land with streams of water.  "
"5195","Deuteronomy","10","8","At that time the  Lord  set apart the tribe of Levi to carry the ark of the covenant of the  Lord , to stand before the  Lord  to minister and to pronounce blessings in his name, as they still do today.  "
"5196","Deuteronomy","10","9","That is why the Levites have no share or inheritance among their fellow Israelites; the  Lord  is their inheritance, as the  Lord  your God told them.) "
"5197","Deuteronomy","10","10","Now I had stayed on the mountain forty days and forty nights, as I did the first time, and the  Lord  listened to me at this time also. It was not his will to destroy you.  "
"5198","Deuteronomy","10","11","“Go,” the  Lord  said to me, “and lead the people on their way, so that they may enter and possess the land I swore to their ancestors to give them.” "
"5199","Deuteronomy","10","12","And now, Israel, what does the  Lord  your God ask of you but to fear the  Lord  your God, to walk in obedience to him, to love him, to serve the  Lord  your God with all your heart and with all your soul,  "
"5200","Deuteronomy","10","13","and to observe the  Lord ’s commands and decrees that I am giving you today for your own good? "
"5201","Deuteronomy","10","14","To the  Lord  your God belong the heavens, even the highest heavens, the earth and everything in it.  "
"5202","Deuteronomy","10","15","Yet the  Lord  set his affection on your ancestors and loved them, and he chose you, their descendants, above all the nations—as it is today.  "
"5203","Deuteronomy","10","16","Circumcise your hearts, therefore, and do not be stiff-necked any longer.  "
"5204","Deuteronomy","10","17","For the  Lord  your God is God of gods and Lord of lords, the great God, mighty and awesome, who shows no partiality and accepts no bribes.  "
"5205","Deuteronomy","10","18","He defends the cause of the fatherless and the widow, and loves the foreigner residing among you, giving them food and clothing.  "
"5206","Deuteronomy","10","19","And you are to love those who are foreigners, for you yourselves were foreigners in Egypt.  "
"5207","Deuteronomy","10","20","Fear the  Lord  your God and serve him. Hold fast to him and take your oaths in his name.  "
"5208","Deuteronomy","10","21","He is the one you praise; he is your God, who performed for you those great and awesome wonders you saw with your own eyes.  "
"5209","Deuteronomy","10","22","Your ancestors who went down into Egypt were seventy in all, and now the  Lord  your God has made you as numerous as the stars in the sky."
"5210","Deuteronomy","11","1","Love the  Lord  your God and keep his requirements, his decrees, his laws and his commands always.  "
"5211","Deuteronomy","11","2","Remember today that your children were not the ones who saw and experienced the discipline of the  Lord  your God: his majesty, his mighty hand, his outstretched arm;  "
"5212","Deuteronomy","11","3","the signs he performed and the things he did in the heart of Egypt, both to Pharaoh king of Egypt and to his whole country;  "
"5213","Deuteronomy","11","4","what he did to the Egyptian army, to its horses and chariots, how he overwhelmed them with the waters of the Red Sea  as they were pursuing you, and how the  Lord  brought lasting ruin on them.  "
"5214","Deuteronomy","11","5","It was not your children who saw what he did for you in the wilderness until you arrived at this place,  "
"5215","Deuteronomy","11","6","and what he did to Dathan and Abiram, sons of Eliab the Reubenite, when the earth opened its mouth right in the middle of all Israel and swallowed them up with their households, their tents and every living thing that belonged to them.  "
"5216","Deuteronomy","11","7","But it was your own eyes that saw all these great things the  Lord  has done. "
"5217","Deuteronomy","11","8","Observe therefore all the commands I am giving you today, so that you may have the strength to go in and take over the land that you are crossing the Jordan to possess,  "
"5218","Deuteronomy","11","9","and so that you may live long in the land the  Lord  swore to your ancestors to give to them and their descendants, a land flowing with milk and honey.  "
"5219","Deuteronomy","11","10","The land you are entering to take over is not like the land of Egypt, from which you have come, where you planted your seed and irrigated it by foot as in a vegetable garden.  "
"5220","Deuteronomy","11","11","But the land you are crossing the Jordan to take possession of is a land of mountains and valleys that drinks rain from heaven.  "
"5221","Deuteronomy","11","12","It is a land the  Lord  your God cares for; the eyes of the  Lord  your God are continually on it from the beginning of the year to its end. "
"5222","Deuteronomy","11","13","So if you faithfully obey the commands I am giving you today—to love the  Lord  your God and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul—  "
"5223","Deuteronomy","11","14","then I will send rain on your land in its season, both autumn and spring rains, so that you may gather in your grain, new wine and olive oil.  "
"5224","Deuteronomy","11","15","I will provide grass in the fields for your cattle, and you will eat and be satisfied. "
"5225","Deuteronomy","11","16","Be careful, or you will be enticed to turn away and worship other gods and bow down to them.  "
"5226","Deuteronomy","11","17","Then the  Lord ’s anger will burn against you, and he will shut up the heavens so that it will not rain and the ground will yield no produce, and you will soon perish from the good land the  Lord  is giving you.  "
"5227","Deuteronomy","11","18","Fix these words of mine in your hearts and minds; tie them as symbols on your hands and bind them on your foreheads.  "
"5228","Deuteronomy","11","19","Teach them to your children, talking about them when you sit at home and when you walk along the road, when you lie down and when you get up.  "
"5229","Deuteronomy","11","20","Write them on the doorframes of your houses and on your gates,  "
"5230","Deuteronomy","11","21","so that your days and the days of your children may be many in the land the  Lord  swore to give your ancestors, as many as the days that the heavens are above the earth. "
"5231","Deuteronomy","11","22","If you carefully observe all these commands I am giving you to follow—to love the  Lord  your God, to walk in obedience to him and to hold fast to him—  "
"5232","Deuteronomy","11","23","then the  Lord  will drive out all these nations before you, and you will dispossess nations larger and stronger than you.  "
"5233","Deuteronomy","11","24","Every place where you set your foot will be yours: Your territory will extend from the desert to Lebanon, and from the Euphrates River to the Mediterranean Sea.  "
"5234","Deuteronomy","11","25","No one will be able to stand against you. The  Lord  your God, as he promised you, will put the terror and fear of you on the whole land, wherever you go. "
"5235","Deuteronomy","11","26","See, I am setting before you today a blessing and a curse—  "
"5236","Deuteronomy","11","27","the blessing if you obey the commands of the  Lord  your God that I am giving you today;  "
"5237","Deuteronomy","11","28","the curse if you disobey the commands of the  Lord  your God and turn from the way that I command you today by following other gods, which you have not known.  "
"5238","Deuteronomy","11","29","When the  Lord  your God has brought you into the land you are entering to possess, you are to proclaim on Mount Gerizim the blessings, and on Mount Ebal the curses.  "
"5239","Deuteronomy","11","30","As you know, these mountains are across the Jordan, westward, toward the setting sun, near the great trees of Moreh, in the territory of those Canaanites living in the Arabah in the vicinity of Gilgal.  "
"5240","Deuteronomy","11","31","You are about to cross the Jordan to enter and take possession of the land the  Lord  your God is giving you. When you have taken it over and are living there,  "
"5241","Deuteronomy","11","32","be sure that you obey all the decrees and laws I am setting before you today."
"5242","Deuteronomy","12","1","These are the decrees and laws you must be careful to follow in the land that the  Lord , the God of your ancestors, has given you to possess—as long as you live in the land.  "
"5243","Deuteronomy","12","2","Destroy completely all the places on the high mountains, on the hills and under every spreading tree, where the nations you are dispossessing worship their gods.  "
"5244","Deuteronomy","12","3","Break down their altars, smash their sacred stones and burn their Asherah poles in the fire; cut down the idols of their gods and wipe out their names from those places. "
"5245","Deuteronomy","12","4","You must not worship the  Lord  your God in their way.  "
"5246","Deuteronomy","12","5","But you are to seek the place the  Lord  your God will choose from among all your tribes to put his Name there for his dwelling. To that place you must go;  "
"5247","Deuteronomy","12","6","there bring your burnt offerings and sacrifices, your tithes and special gifts, what you have vowed to give and your freewill offerings, and the firstborn of your herds and flocks.  "
"5248","Deuteronomy","12","7","There, in the presence of the  Lord  your God, you and your families shall eat and shall rejoice in everything you have put your hand to, because the  Lord  your God has blessed you. "
"5249","Deuteronomy","12","8","You are not to do as we do here today, everyone doing as they see fit,  "
"5250","Deuteronomy","12","9","since you have not yet reached the resting place and the inheritance the  Lord  your God is giving you.  "
"5251","Deuteronomy","12","10","But you will cross the Jordan and settle in the land the  Lord  your God is giving you as an inheritance, and he will give you rest from all your enemies around you so that you will live in safety.  "
"5252","Deuteronomy","12","11","Then to the place the  Lord  your God will choose as a dwelling for his Name—there you are to bring everything I command you: your burnt offerings and sacrifices, your tithes and special gifts, and all the choice possessions you have vowed to the  Lord .  "
"5253","Deuteronomy","12","12","And there rejoice before the  Lord  your God—you, your sons and daughters, your male and female servants, and the Levites from your towns who have no allotment or inheritance of their own.  "
"5254","Deuteronomy","12","13","Be careful not to sacrifice your burnt offerings anywhere you please.  "
"5255","Deuteronomy","12","14","Offer them only at the place the  Lord  will choose in one of your tribes, and there observe everything I command you. "
"5256","Deuteronomy","12","15","Nevertheless, you may slaughter your animals in any of your towns and eat as much of the meat as you want, as if it were gazelle or deer, according to the blessing the  Lord  your God gives you. Both the ceremonially unclean and the clean may eat it.  "
"5257","Deuteronomy","12","16","But you must not eat the blood; pour it out on the ground like water.  "
"5258","Deuteronomy","12","17","You must not eat in your own towns the tithe of your grain and new wine and olive oil, or the firstborn of your herds and flocks, or whatever you have vowed to give, or your freewill offerings or special gifts.  "
"5259","Deuteronomy","12","18","Instead, you are to eat them in the presence of the  Lord  your God at the place the  Lord  your God will choose—you, your sons and daughters, your male and female servants, and the Levites from your towns—and you are to rejoice before the  Lord  your God in everything you put your hand to.  "
"5260","Deuteronomy","12","19","Be careful not to neglect the Levites as long as you live in your land. "
"5261","Deuteronomy","12","20","When the  Lord  your God has enlarged your territory as he promised you, and you crave meat and say, “I would like some meat,” then you may eat as much of it as you want.  "
"5262","Deuteronomy","12","21","If the place where the  Lord  your God chooses to put his Name is too far away from you, you may slaughter animals from the herds and flocks the  Lord  has given you, as I have commanded you, and in your own towns you may eat as much of them as you want.  "
"5263","Deuteronomy","12","22","Eat them as you would gazelle or deer. Both the ceremonially unclean and the clean may eat.  "
"5264","Deuteronomy","12","23","But be sure you do not eat the blood, because the blood is the life, and you must not eat the life with the meat.  "
"5265","Deuteronomy","12","24","You must not eat the blood; pour it out on the ground like water.  "
"5266","Deuteronomy","12","25","Do not eat it, so that it may go well with you and your children after you, because you will be doing what is right in the eyes of the  Lord . "
"5267","Deuteronomy","12","26","But take your consecrated things and whatever you have vowed to give, and go to the place the  Lord  will choose.  "
"5268","Deuteronomy","12","27","Present your burnt offerings on the altar of the  Lord  your God, both the meat and the blood. The blood of your sacrifices must be poured beside the altar of the  Lord  your God, but you may eat the meat.  "
"5269","Deuteronomy","12","28","Be careful to obey all these regulations I am giving you, so that it may always go well with you and your children after you, because you will be doing what is good and right in the eyes of the  Lord  your God. "
"5270","Deuteronomy","12","29","The  Lord  your God will cut off before you the nations you are about to invade and dispossess. But when you have driven them out and settled in their land,  "
"5271","Deuteronomy","12","30","and after they have been destroyed before you, be careful not to be ensnared by inquiring about their gods, saying, “How do these nations serve their gods? We will do the same.”  "
"5272","Deuteronomy","12","31","You must not worship the  Lord  your God in their way, because in worshiping their gods, they do all kinds of detestable things the  Lord  hates. They even burn their sons and daughters in the fire as sacrifices to their gods. "
"5273","Deuteronomy","12","32","See that you do all I command you; do not add to it or take away from it."
"5274","Deuteronomy","13","1","If a prophet, or one who foretells by dreams, appears among you and announces to you a sign or wonder,  "
"5275","Deuteronomy","13","2","and if the sign or wonder spoken of takes place, and the prophet says, “Let us follow other gods” (gods you have not known) “and let us worship them,”  "
"5276","Deuteronomy","13","3","you must not listen to the words of that prophet or dreamer. The  Lord  your God is testing you to find out whether you love him with all your heart and with all your soul.  "
"5277","Deuteronomy","13","4","It is the  Lord  your God you must follow, and him you must revere. Keep his commands and obey him; serve him and hold fast to him.  "
"5278","Deuteronomy","13","5","That prophet or dreamer must be put to death for inciting rebellion against the  Lord  your God, who brought you out of Egypt and redeemed you from the land of slavery. That prophet or dreamer tried to turn you from the way the  Lord  your God commanded you to follow. You must purge the evil from among you. "
"5279","Deuteronomy","13","6","If your very own brother, or your son or daughter, or the wife you love, or your closest friend secretly entices you, saying, “Let us go and worship other gods” (gods that neither you nor your ancestors have known,  "
"5280","Deuteronomy","13","7","gods of the peoples around you, whether near or far, from one end of the land to the other),  "
"5281","Deuteronomy","13","8","do not yield to them or listen to them. Show them no pity. Do not spare them or shield them.  "
"5282","Deuteronomy","13","9","You must certainly put them to death. Your hand must be the first in putting them to death, and then the hands of all the people.  "
"5283","Deuteronomy","13","10","Stone them to death, because they tried to turn you away from the  Lord  your God, who brought you out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery.  "
"5284","Deuteronomy","13","11","Then all Israel will hear and be afraid, and no one among you will do such an evil thing again. "
"5285","Deuteronomy","13","12","If you hear it said about one of the towns the  Lord  your God is giving you to live in  "
"5286","Deuteronomy","13","13","that troublemakers have arisen among you and have led the people of their town astray, saying, “Let us go and worship other gods” (gods you have not known),  "
"5287","Deuteronomy","13","14","then you must inquire, probe and investigate it thoroughly. And if it is true and it has been proved that this detestable thing has been done among you,  "
"5288","Deuteronomy","13","15","you must certainly put to the sword all who live in that town. You must destroy it completely,  both its people and its livestock.  "
"5289","Deuteronomy","13","16","You are to gather all the plunder of the town into the middle of the public square and completely burn the town and all its plunder as a whole burnt offering to the  Lord  your God. That town is to remain a ruin forever, never to be rebuilt,  "
"5290","Deuteronomy","13","17","and none of the condemned things  are to be found in your hands. Then the  Lord  will turn from his fierce anger, will show you mercy, and will have compassion on you. He will increase your numbers, as he promised on oath to your ancestors—  "
"5291","Deuteronomy","13","18","because you obey the  Lord  your God by keeping all his commands that I am giving you today and doing what is right in his eyes."
"5292","Deuteronomy","14","1","You are the children of the  Lord  your God. Do not cut yourselves or shave the front of your heads for the dead,  "
"5293","Deuteronomy","14","2","for you are a people holy to the  Lord  your God. Out of all the peoples on the face of the earth, the  Lord  has chosen you to be his treasured possession. "
"5294","Deuteronomy","14","3","Do not eat any detestable thing.  "
"5295","Deuteronomy","14","4","These are the animals you may eat: the ox, the sheep, the goat,  "
"5296","Deuteronomy","14","5","the deer, the gazelle, the roe deer, the wild goat, the ibex, the antelope and the mountain sheep.   "
"5297","Deuteronomy","14","6","You may eat any animal that has a divided hoof and that chews the cud.  "
"5298","Deuteronomy","14","7","However, of those that chew the cud or that have a divided hoof you may not eat the camel, the rabbit or the hyrax. Although they chew the cud, they do not have a divided hoof; they are ceremonially unclean for you.  "
"5299","Deuteronomy","14","8","The pig is also unclean; although it has a divided hoof, it does not chew the cud. You are not to eat their meat or touch their carcasses. "
"5300","Deuteronomy","14","9","Of all the creatures living in the water, you may eat any that has fins and scales.  "
"5301","Deuteronomy","14","10","But anything that does not have fins and scales you may not eat; for you it is unclean. "
"5302","Deuteronomy","14","11","You may eat any clean bird.  "
"5303","Deuteronomy","14","12","But these you may not eat: the eagle, the vulture, the black vulture,  "
"5304","Deuteronomy","14","13","the red kite, the black kite, any kind of falcon,  "
"5305","Deuteronomy","14","14","any kind of raven,  "
"5306","Deuteronomy","14","15","the horned owl, the screech owl, the gull, any kind of hawk,  "
"5307","Deuteronomy","14","16","the little owl, the great owl, the white owl,  "
"5308","Deuteronomy","14","17","the desert owl, the osprey, the cormorant,  "
"5309","Deuteronomy","14","18","the stork, any kind of heron, the hoopoe and the bat. "
"5310","Deuteronomy","14","19","All flying insects are unclean to you; do not eat them.  "
"5311","Deuteronomy","14","20","But any winged creature that is clean you may eat. "
"5312","Deuteronomy","14","21","Do not eat anything you find already dead. You may give it to the foreigner residing in any of your towns, and they may eat it, or you may sell it to any other foreigner. But you are a people holy to the  Lord  your God. Do not cook a young goat in its mother’s milk. "
"5313","Deuteronomy","14","22","Be sure to set aside a tenth of all that your fields produce each year.  "
"5314","Deuteronomy","14","23","Eat the tithe of your grain, new wine and olive oil, and the firstborn of your herds and flocks in the presence of the  Lord  your God at the place he will choose as a dwelling for his Name, so that you may learn to revere the  Lord  your God always.  "
"5315","Deuteronomy","14","24","But if that place is too distant and you have been blessed by the  Lord  your God and cannot carry your tithe (because the place where the  Lord  will choose to put his Name is so far away),  "
"5316","Deuteronomy","14","25","then exchange your tithe for silver, and take the silver with you and go to the place the  Lord  your God will choose.  "
"5317","Deuteronomy","14","26","Use the silver to buy whatever you like: cattle, sheep, wine or other fermented drink, or anything you wish. Then you and your household shall eat there in the presence of the  Lord  your God and rejoice.  "
"5318","Deuteronomy","14","27","And do not neglect the Levites living in your towns, for they have no allotment or inheritance of their own. "
"5319","Deuteronomy","14","28","At the end of every three years, bring all the tithes of that year’s produce and store it in your towns,  "
"5320","Deuteronomy","14","29","so that the Levites (who have no allotment or inheritance of their own) and the foreigners, the fatherless and the widows who live in your towns may come and eat and be satisfied, and so that the  Lord  your God may bless you in all the work of your hands."
"5321","Deuteronomy","15","1","At the end of every seven years you must cancel debts.  "
"5322","Deuteronomy","15","2","This is how it is to be done: Every creditor shall cancel any loan they have made to a fellow Israelite. They shall not require payment from anyone among their own people, because the  Lord ’s time for canceling debts has been proclaimed.  "
"5323","Deuteronomy","15","3","You may require payment from a foreigner, but you must cancel any debt your fellow Israelite owes you.  "
"5324","Deuteronomy","15","4","However, there need be no poor people among you, for in the land the  Lord  your God is giving you to possess as your inheritance, he will richly bless you,  "
"5325","Deuteronomy","15","5","if only you fully obey the  Lord  your God and are careful to follow all these commands I am giving you today.  "
"5326","Deuteronomy","15","6","For the  Lord  your God will bless you as he has promised, and you will lend to many nations but will borrow from none. You will rule over many nations but none will rule over you. "
"5327","Deuteronomy","15","7","If anyone is poor among your fellow Israelites in any of the towns of the land the  Lord  your God is giving you, do not be hardhearted or tightfisted toward them.  "
"5328","Deuteronomy","15","8","Rather, be openhanded and freely lend them whatever they need.  "
"5329","Deuteronomy","15","9","Be careful not to harbor this wicked thought: “The seventh year, the year for canceling debts, is near,” so that you do not show ill will toward the needy among your fellow Israelites and give them nothing. They may then appeal to the  Lord  against you, and you will be found guilty of sin.  "
"5330","Deuteronomy","15","10","Give generously to them and do so without a grudging heart; then because of this the  Lord  your God will bless you in all your work and in everything you put your hand to.  "
"5331","Deuteronomy","15","11","There will always be poor people in the land. Therefore I command you to be openhanded toward your fellow Israelites who are poor and needy in your land. "
"5332","Deuteronomy","15","12","If any of your people—Hebrew men or women—sell themselves to you and serve you six years, in the seventh year you must let them go free.  "
"5333","Deuteronomy","15","13","And when you release them, do not send them away empty-handed.  "
"5334","Deuteronomy","15","14","Supply them liberally from your flock, your threshing floor and your winepress. Give to them as the  Lord  your God has blessed you.  "
"5335","Deuteronomy","15","15","Remember that you were slaves in Egypt and the  Lord  your God redeemed you. That is why I give you this command today. "
"5336","Deuteronomy","15","16","But if your servant says to you, “I do not want to leave you,” because he loves you and your family and is well off with you,  "
"5337","Deuteronomy","15","17","then take an awl and push it through his earlobe into the door, and he will become your servant for life. Do the same for your female servant. "
"5338","Deuteronomy","15","18","Do not consider it a hardship to set your servant free, because their service to you these six years has been worth twice as much as that of a hired hand. And the  Lord  your God will bless you in everything you do. "
"5339","Deuteronomy","15","19","Set apart for the  Lord  your God every firstborn male of your herds and flocks. Do not put the firstborn of your cows to work, and do not shear the firstborn of your sheep.  "
"5340","Deuteronomy","15","20","Each year you and your family are to eat them in the presence of the  Lord  your God at the place he will choose.  "
"5341","Deuteronomy","15","21","If an animal has a defect, is lame or blind, or has any serious flaw, you must not sacrifice it to the  Lord  your God.  "
"5342","Deuteronomy","15","22","You are to eat it in your own towns. Both the ceremonially unclean and the clean may eat it, as if it were gazelle or deer.  "
"5343","Deuteronomy","15","23","But you must not eat the blood; pour it out on the ground like water."
"5344","Deuteronomy","16","1","Observe the month of Aviv and celebrate the Passover of the  Lord  your God, because in the month of Aviv he brought you out of Egypt by night.  "
"5345","Deuteronomy","16","2","Sacrifice as the Passover to the  Lord  your God an animal from your flock or herd at the place the  Lord  will choose as a dwelling for his Name.  "
"5346","Deuteronomy","16","3","Do not eat it with bread made with yeast, but for seven days eat unleavened bread, the bread of affliction, because you left Egypt in haste—so that all the days of your life you may remember the time of your departure from Egypt.  "
"5347","Deuteronomy","16","4","Let no yeast be found in your possession in all your land for seven days. Do not let any of the meat you sacrifice on the evening of the first day remain until morning. "
"5348","Deuteronomy","16","5","You must not sacrifice the Passover in any town the  Lord  your God gives you  "
"5349","Deuteronomy","16","6","except in the place he will choose as a dwelling for his Name. There you must sacrifice the Passover in the evening, when the sun goes down, on the anniversary  of your departure from Egypt.  "
"5350","Deuteronomy","16","7","Roast it and eat it at the place the  Lord  your God will choose. Then in the morning return to your tents.  "
"5351","Deuteronomy","16","8","For six days eat unleavened bread and on the seventh day hold an assembly to the  Lord  your God and do no work. "
"5352","Deuteronomy","16","9","Count off seven weeks from the time you begin to put the sickle to the standing grain.  "
"5353","Deuteronomy","16","10","Then celebrate the Festival of Weeks to the  Lord  your God by giving a freewill offering in proportion to the blessings the  Lord  your God has given you.  "
"5354","Deuteronomy","16","11","And rejoice before the  Lord  your God at the place he will choose as a dwelling for his Name—you, your sons and daughters, your male and female servants, the Levites in your towns, and the foreigners, the fatherless and the widows living among you.  "
"5355","Deuteronomy","16","12","Remember that you were slaves in Egypt, and follow carefully these decrees. "
"5356","Deuteronomy","16","13","Celebrate the Festival of Tabernacles for seven days after you have gathered the produce of your threshing floor and your winepress.  "
"5357","Deuteronomy","16","14","Be joyful at your festival—you, your sons and daughters, your male and female servants, and the Levites, the foreigners, the fatherless and the widows who live in your towns.  "
"5358","Deuteronomy","16","15","For seven days celebrate the festival to the  Lord  your God at the place the  Lord  will choose. For the  Lord  your God will bless you in all your harvest and in all the work of your hands, and your joy will be complete. "
"5359","Deuteronomy","16","16","Three times a year all your men must appear before the  Lord  your God at the place he will choose: at the Festival of Unleavened Bread, the Festival of Weeks and the Festival of Tabernacles. No one should appear before the  Lord  empty-handed:  "
"5360","Deuteronomy","16","17","Each of you must bring a gift in proportion to the way the  Lord  your God has blessed you. "
"5361","Deuteronomy","16","18","Appoint judges and officials for each of your tribes in every town the  Lord  your God is giving you, and they shall judge the people fairly.  "
"5362","Deuteronomy","16","19","Do not pervert justice or show partiality. Do not accept a bribe, for a bribe blinds the eyes of the wise and twists the words of the innocent.  "
"5363","Deuteronomy","16","20","Follow justice and justice alone, so that you may live and possess the land the  Lord  your God is giving you. "
"5364","Deuteronomy","16","21","Do not set up any wooden Asherah pole beside the altar you build to the  Lord  your God,  "
"5365","Deuteronomy","16","22","and do not erect a sacred stone, for these the  Lord  your God hates."
"5366","Deuteronomy","17","1","Do not sacrifice to the  Lord  your God an ox or a sheep that has any defect or flaw in it, for that would be detestable to him. "
"5367","Deuteronomy","17","2","If a man or woman living among you in one of the towns the  Lord  gives you is found doing evil in the eyes of the  Lord  your God in violation of his covenant,  "
"5368","Deuteronomy","17","3","and contrary to my command has worshiped other gods, bowing down to them or to the sun or the moon or the stars in the sky,  "
"5369","Deuteronomy","17","4","and this has been brought to your attention, then you must investigate it thoroughly. If it is true and it has been proved that this detestable thing has been done in Israel,  "
"5370","Deuteronomy","17","5","take the man or woman who has done this evil deed to your city gate and stone that person to death.  "
"5371","Deuteronomy","17","6","On the testimony of two or three witnesses a person is to be put to death, but no one is to be put to death on the testimony of only one witness.  "
"5372","Deuteronomy","17","7","The hands of the witnesses must be the first in putting that person to death, and then the hands of all the people. You must purge the evil from among you. "
"5373","Deuteronomy","17","8","If cases come before your courts that are too difficult for you to judge—whether bloodshed, lawsuits or assaults—take them to the place the  Lord  your God will choose.  "
"5374","Deuteronomy","17","9","Go to the Levitical priests and to the judge who is in office at that time. Inquire of them and they will give you the verdict.  "
"5375","Deuteronomy","17","10","You must act according to the decisions they give you at the place the  Lord  will choose. Be careful to do everything they instruct you to do.  "
"5376","Deuteronomy","17","11","Act according to whatever they teach you and the decisions they give you. Do not turn aside from what they tell you, to the right or to the left.  "
"5377","Deuteronomy","17","12","Anyone who shows contempt for the judge or for the priest who stands ministering there to the  Lord  your God is to be put to death. You must purge the evil from Israel.  "
"5378","Deuteronomy","17","13","All the people will hear and be afraid, and will not be contemptuous again. "
"5379","Deuteronomy","17","14","When you enter the land the  Lord  your God is giving you and have taken possession of it and settled in it, and you say, “Let us set a king over us like all the nations around us,”  "
"5380","Deuteronomy","17","15","be sure to appoint over you a king the  Lord  your God chooses. He must be from among your fellow Israelites. Do not place a foreigner over you, one who is not an Israelite.  "
"5381","Deuteronomy","17","16","The king, moreover, must not acquire great numbers of horses for himself or make the people return to Egypt to get more of them, for the  Lord  has told you, “You are not to go back that way again.”  "
"5382","Deuteronomy","17","17","He must not take many wives, or his heart will be led astray. He must not accumulate large amounts of silver and gold. "
"5383","Deuteronomy","17","18","When he takes the throne of his kingdom, he is to write for himself on a scroll a copy of this law, taken from that of the Levitical priests.  "
"5384","Deuteronomy","17","19","It is to be with him, and he is to read it all the days of his life so that he may learn to revere the  Lord  his God and follow carefully all the words of this law and these decrees  "
"5385","Deuteronomy","17","20","and not consider himself better than his fellow Israelites and turn from the law to the right or to the left. Then he and his descendants will reign a long time over his kingdom in Israel."
"5386","Deuteronomy","18","1","The Levitical priests—indeed, the whole tribe of Levi—are to have no allotment or inheritance with Israel. They shall live on the food offerings presented to the  Lord , for that is their inheritance.  "
"5387","Deuteronomy","18","2","They shall have no inheritance among their fellow Israelites; the  Lord  is their inheritance, as he promised them. "
"5388","Deuteronomy","18","3","This is the share due the priests from the people who sacrifice a bull or a sheep: the shoulder, the internal organs and the meat from the head.  "
"5389","Deuteronomy","18","4","You are to give them the firstfruits of your grain, new wine and olive oil, and the first wool from the shearing of your sheep,  "
"5390","Deuteronomy","18","5","for the  Lord  your God has chosen them and their descendants out of all your tribes to stand and minister in the  Lord ’s name always. "
"5391","Deuteronomy","18","6","If a Levite moves from one of your towns anywhere in Israel where he is living, and comes in all earnestness to the place the  Lord  will choose,  "
"5392","Deuteronomy","18","7","he may minister in the name of the  Lord  his God like all his fellow Levites who serve there in the presence of the  Lord .  "
"5393","Deuteronomy","18","8","He is to share equally in their benefits, even though he has received money from the sale of family possessions. "
"5394","Deuteronomy","18","9","When you enter the land the  Lord  your God is giving you, do not learn to imitate the detestable ways of the nations there.  "
"5395","Deuteronomy","18","10","Let no one be found among you who sacrifices their son or daughter in the fire, who practices divination or sorcery, interprets omens, engages in witchcraft,  "
"5396","Deuteronomy","18","11","or casts spells, or who is a medium or spiritist or who consults the dead.  "
"5397","Deuteronomy","18","12","Anyone who does these things is detestable to the  Lord ; because of these same detestable practices the  Lord  your God will drive out those nations before you.  "
"5398","Deuteronomy","18","13","You must be blameless before the  Lord  your God. "
"5399","Deuteronomy","18","14","The nations you will dispossess listen to those who practice sorcery or divination. But as for you, the  Lord  your God has not permitted you to do so.  "
"5400","Deuteronomy","18","15","The  Lord  your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among you, from your fellow Israelites. You must listen to him.  "
"5401","Deuteronomy","18","16","For this is what you asked of the  Lord  your God at Horeb on the day of the assembly when you said, “Let us not hear the voice of the  Lord  our God nor see this great fire anymore, or we will die.” "
"5402","Deuteronomy","18","17","The  Lord  said to me: “What they say is good.  "
"5403","Deuteronomy","18","18","I will raise up for them a prophet like you from among their fellow Israelites, and I will put my words in his mouth. He will tell them everything I command him.  "
"5404","Deuteronomy","18","19","I myself will call to account anyone who does not listen to my words that the prophet speaks in my name.  "
"5405","Deuteronomy","18","20","But a prophet who presumes to speak in my name anything I have not commanded, or a prophet who speaks in the name of other gods, is to be put to death.” "
"5406","Deuteronomy","18","21","You may say to yourselves, “How can we know when a message has not been spoken by the  Lord ?”  "
"5407","Deuteronomy","18","22","If what a prophet proclaims in the name of the  Lord  does not take place or come true, that is a message the  Lord  has not spoken. That prophet has spoken presumptuously, so do not be alarmed."
"5408","Deuteronomy","19","1","When the  Lord  your God has destroyed the nations whose land he is giving you, and when you have driven them out and settled in their towns and houses,  "
"5409","Deuteronomy","19","2","then set aside for yourselves three cities in the land the  Lord  your God is giving you to possess.  "
"5410","Deuteronomy","19","3","Determine the distances involved and divide into three parts the land the  Lord  your God is giving you as an inheritance, so that a person who kills someone may flee for refuge to one of these cities. "
"5411","Deuteronomy","19","4","This is the rule concerning anyone who kills a person and flees there for safety—anyone who kills a neighbor unintentionally, without malice aforethought.  "
"5412","Deuteronomy","19","5","For instance, a man may go into the forest with his neighbor to cut wood, and as he swings his ax to fell a tree, the head may fly off and hit his neighbor and kill him. That man may flee to one of these cities and save his life.  "
"5413","Deuteronomy","19","6","Otherwise, the avenger of blood might pursue him in a rage, overtake him if the distance is too great, and kill him even though he is not deserving of death, since he did it to his neighbor without malice aforethought.  "
"5414","Deuteronomy","19","7","This is why I command you to set aside for yourselves three cities. "
"5415","Deuteronomy","19","8","If the  Lord  your God enlarges your territory, as he promised on oath to your ancestors, and gives you the whole land he promised them,  "
"5416","Deuteronomy","19","9","because you carefully follow all these laws I command you today—to love the  Lord  your God and to walk always in obedience to him—then you are to set aside three more cities.  "
"5417","Deuteronomy","19","10","Do this so that innocent blood will not be shed in your land, which the  Lord  your God is giving you as your inheritance, and so that you will not be guilty of bloodshed. "
"5418","Deuteronomy","19","11","But if out of hate someone lies in wait, assaults and kills a neighbor, and then flees to one of these cities,  "
"5419","Deuteronomy","19","12","the killer shall be sent for by the town elders, be brought back from the city, and be handed over to the avenger of blood to die.  "
"5420","Deuteronomy","19","13","Show no pity. You must purge from Israel the guilt of shedding innocent blood, so that it may go well with you. "
"5421","Deuteronomy","19","14","Do not move your neighbor’s boundary stone set up by your predecessors in the inheritance you receive in the land the  Lord  your God is giving you to possess. "
"5422","Deuteronomy","19","15","One witness is not enough to convict anyone accused of any crime or offense they may have committed. A matter must be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses. "
"5423","Deuteronomy","19","16","If a malicious witness takes the stand to accuse someone of a crime,  "
"5424","Deuteronomy","19","17","the two people involved in the dispute must stand in the presence of the  Lord  before the priests and the judges who are in office at the time.  "
"5425","Deuteronomy","19","18","The judges must make a thorough investigation, and if the witness proves to be a liar, giving false testimony against a fellow Israelite,  "
"5426","Deuteronomy","19","19","then do to the false witness as that witness intended to do to the other party. You must purge the evil from among you.  "
"5427","Deuteronomy","19","20","The rest of the people will hear of this and be afraid, and never again will such an evil thing be done among you.  "
"5428","Deuteronomy","19","21","Show no pity: life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot."
"5429","Deuteronomy","20","1","When you go to war against your enemies and see horses and chariots and an army greater than yours, do not be afraid of them, because the  Lord  your God, who brought you up out of Egypt, will be with you.  "
"5430","Deuteronomy","20","2","When you are about to go into battle, the priest shall come forward and address the army.  "
"5431","Deuteronomy","20","3","He shall say: “Hear, Israel: Today you are going into battle against your enemies. Do not be fainthearted or afraid; do not panic or be terrified by them.  "
"5432","Deuteronomy","20","4","For the  Lord  your God is the one who goes with you to fight for you against your enemies to give you victory.” "
"5433","Deuteronomy","20","5","The officers shall say to the army: “Has anyone built a new house and not yet begun to live in it? Let him go home, or he may die in battle and someone else may begin to live in it.  "
"5434","Deuteronomy","20","6","Has anyone planted a vineyard and not begun to enjoy it? Let him go home, or he may die in battle and someone else enjoy it.  "
"5435","Deuteronomy","20","7","Has anyone become pledged to a woman and not married her? Let him go home, or he may die in battle and someone else marry her.”  "
"5436","Deuteronomy","20","8","Then the officers shall add, “Is anyone afraid or fainthearted? Let him go home so that his fellow soldiers will not become disheartened too.”  "
"5437","Deuteronomy","20","9","When the officers have finished speaking to the army, they shall appoint commanders over it. "
"5438","Deuteronomy","20","10","When you march up to attack a city, make its people an offer of peace.  "
"5439","Deuteronomy","20","11","If they accept and open their gates, all the people in it shall be subject to forced labor and shall work for you.  "
"5440","Deuteronomy","20","12","If they refuse to make peace and they engage you in battle, lay siege to that city.  "
"5441","Deuteronomy","20","13","When the  Lord  your God delivers it into your hand, put to the sword all the men in it.  "
"5442","Deuteronomy","20","14","As for the women, the children, the livestock and everything else in the city, you may take these as plunder for yourselves. And you may use the plunder the  Lord  your God gives you from your enemies.  "
"5443","Deuteronomy","20","15","This is how you are to treat all the cities that are at a distance from you and do not belong to the nations nearby. "
"5444","Deuteronomy","20","16","However, in the cities of the nations the  Lord  your God is giving you as an inheritance, do not leave alive anything that breathes.  "
"5445","Deuteronomy","20","17","Completely destroy  them—the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites—as the  Lord  your God has commanded you.  "
"5446","Deuteronomy","20","18","Otherwise, they will teach you to follow all the detestable things they do in worshiping their gods, and you will sin against the  Lord  your God. "
"5447","Deuteronomy","20","19","When you lay siege to a city for a long time, fighting against it to capture it, do not destroy its trees by putting an ax to them, because you can eat their fruit. Do not cut them down. Are the trees people, that you should besiege them?   "
"5448","Deuteronomy","20","20","However, you may cut down trees that you know are not fruit trees and use them to build siege works until the city at war with you falls."
"5449","Deuteronomy","21","1","If someone is found slain, lying in a field in the land the  Lord  your God is giving you to possess, and it is not known who the killer was,  "
"5450","Deuteronomy","21","2","your elders and judges shall go out and measure the distance from the body to the neighboring towns.  "
"5451","Deuteronomy","21","3","Then the elders of the town nearest the body shall take a heifer that has never been worked and has never worn a yoke  "
"5452","Deuteronomy","21","4","and lead it down to a valley that has not been plowed or planted and where there is a flowing stream. There in the valley they are to break the heifer’s neck.  "
"5453","Deuteronomy","21","5","The Levitical priests shall step forward, for the  Lord  your God has chosen them to minister and to pronounce blessings in the name of the  Lord  and to decide all cases of dispute and assault.  "
"5454","Deuteronomy","21","6","Then all the elders of the town nearest the body shall wash their hands over the heifer whose neck was broken in the valley,  "
"5455","Deuteronomy","21","7","and they shall declare: “Our hands did not shed this blood, nor did our eyes see it done.  "
"5456","Deuteronomy","21","8","Accept this atonement for your people Israel, whom you have redeemed,  Lord , and do not hold your people guilty of the blood of an innocent person.” Then the bloodshed will be atoned for,  "
"5457","Deuteronomy","21","9","and you will have purged from yourselves the guilt of shedding innocent blood, since you have done what is right in the eyes of the  Lord . "
"5458","Deuteronomy","21","10","When you go to war against your enemies and the  Lord  your God delivers them into your hands and you take captives,  "
"5459","Deuteronomy","21","11","if you notice among the captives a beautiful woman and are attracted to her, you may take her as your wife.  "
"5460","Deuteronomy","21","12","Bring her into your home and have her shave her head, trim her nails  "
"5461","Deuteronomy","21","13","and put aside the clothes she was wearing when captured. After she has lived in your house and mourned her father and mother for a full month, then you may go to her and be her husband and she shall be your wife.  "
"5462","Deuteronomy","21","14","If you are not pleased with her, let her go wherever she wishes. You must not sell her or treat her as a slave, since you have dishonored her. "
"5463","Deuteronomy","21","15","If a man has two wives, and he loves one but not the other, and both bear him sons but the firstborn is the son of the wife he does not love,  "
"5464","Deuteronomy","21","16","when he wills his property to his sons, he must not give the rights of the firstborn to the son of the wife he loves in preference to his actual firstborn, the son of the wife he does not love.  "
"5465","Deuteronomy","21","17","He must acknowledge the son of his unloved wife as the firstborn by giving him a double share of all he has. That son is the first sign of his father’s strength. The right of the firstborn belongs to him. "
"5466","Deuteronomy","21","18","If someone has a stubborn and rebellious son who does not obey his father and mother and will not listen to them when they discipline him,  "
"5467","Deuteronomy","21","19","his father and mother shall take hold of him and bring him to the elders at the gate of his town.  "
"5468","Deuteronomy","21","20","They shall say to the elders, “This son of ours is stubborn and rebellious. He will not obey us. He is a glutton and a drunkard.”  "
"5469","Deuteronomy","21","21","Then all the men of his town are to stone him to death. You must purge the evil from among you. All Israel will hear of it and be afraid. "
"5470","Deuteronomy","21","22","If someone guilty of a capital offense is put to death and their body is exposed on a pole,  "
"5471","Deuteronomy","21","23","you must not leave the body hanging on the pole overnight. Be sure to bury it that same day, because anyone who is hung on a pole is under God’s curse. You must not desecrate the land the  Lord  your God is giving you as an inheritance."
"5472","Deuteronomy","22","1","If you see your fellow Israelite’s ox or sheep straying, do not ignore it but be sure to take it back to its owner.  "
"5473","Deuteronomy","22","2","If they do not live near you or if you do not know who owns it, take it home with you and keep it until they come looking for it. Then give it back.  "
"5474","Deuteronomy","22","3","Do the same if you find their donkey or cloak or anything else they have lost. Do not ignore it. "
"5475","Deuteronomy","22","4","If you see your fellow Israelite’s donkey or ox fallen on the road, do not ignore it. Help the owner get it to its feet. "
"5476","Deuteronomy","22","5","A woman must not wear men’s clothing, nor a man wear women’s clothing, for the  Lord  your God detests anyone who does this. "
"5477","Deuteronomy","22","6","If you come across a bird’s nest beside the road, either in a tree or on the ground, and the mother is sitting on the young or on the eggs, do not take the mother with the young.  "

"5479","Deuteronomy","22","8","When you build a new house, make a parapet around your roof so that you may not bring the guilt of bloodshed on your house if someone falls from the roof. "
"5480","Deuteronomy","22","9","Do not plant two kinds of seed in your vineyard; if you do, not only the crops you plant but also the fruit of the vineyard will be defiled. "

"5482","Deuteronomy","22","11","Do not wear clothes of wool and linen woven together. "
"5483","Deuteronomy","22","12","Make tassels on the four corners of the cloak you wear. "
"5484","Deuteronomy","22","13","If a man takes a wife and, after sleeping with her, dislikes her  "
"5485","Deuteronomy","22","14","and slanders her and gives her a bad name, saying, “I married this woman, but when I approached her, I did not find proof of her virginity,”  "
"5486","Deuteronomy","22","15","then the young woman’s father and mother shall bring to the town elders at the gate proof that she was a virgin.  "
"5487","Deuteronomy","22","16","Her father will say to the elders, “I gave my daughter in marriage to this man, but he dislikes her.  "
"5488","Deuteronomy","22","17","Now he has slandered her and said, ‘I did not find your daughter to be a virgin.’ But here is the proof of my daughter’s virginity.” Then her parents shall display the cloth before the elders of the town,  "
"5489","Deuteronomy","22","18","and the elders shall take the man and punish him.  "
"5490","Deuteronomy","22","19","They shall fine him a hundred shekels  of silver and give them to the young woman’s father, because this man has given an Israelite virgin a bad name. She shall continue to be his wife; he must not divorce her as long as he lives. "
"5491","Deuteronomy","22","20","If, however, the charge is true and no proof of the young woman’s virginity can be found,  "
"5492","Deuteronomy","22","21","she shall be brought to the door of her father’s house and there the men of her town shall stone her to death. She has done an outrageous thing in Israel by being promiscuous while still in her father’s house. You must purge the evil from among you. "
"5493","Deuteronomy","22","22","If a man is found sleeping with another man’s wife, both the man who slept with her and the woman must die. You must purge the evil from Israel. "
"5494","Deuteronomy","22","23","If a man happens to meet in a town a virgin pledged to be married and he sleeps with her,  "
"5495","Deuteronomy","22","24","you shall take both of them to the gate of that town and stone them to death—the young woman because she was in a town and did not scream for help, and the man because he violated another man’s wife. You must purge the evil from among you. "
"5496","Deuteronomy","22","25","But if out in the country a man happens to meet a young woman pledged to be married and rapes her, only the man who has done this shall die.  "
"5497","Deuteronomy","22","26","Do nothing to the woman; she has committed no sin deserving death. This case is like that of someone who attacks and murders a neighbor,  "
"5498","Deuteronomy","22","27","for the man found the young woman out in the country, and though the betrothed woman screamed, there was no one to rescue her. "
"5499","Deuteronomy","22","28","If a man happens to meet a virgin who is not pledged to be married and rapes her and they are discovered,  "
"5500","Deuteronomy","22","29","he shall pay her father fifty shekels  of silver. He must marry the young woman, for he has violated her. He can never divorce her as long as he lives. "

"5504","Deuteronomy","23","3","No Ammonite or Moabite or any of their descendants may enter the assembly of the  Lord , not even in the tenth generation.  "
"5505","Deuteronomy","23","4","For they did not come to meet you with bread and water on your way when you came out of Egypt, and they hired Balaam son of Beor from Pethor in Aram Naharaim  to pronounce a curse on you.  "
"5506","Deuteronomy","23","5","However, the  Lord  your God would not listen to Balaam but turned the curse into a blessing for you, because the  Lord  your God loves you.  "
"5507","Deuteronomy","23","6","Do not seek a treaty of friendship with them as long as you live. "
"5508","Deuteronomy","23","7","Do not despise an Edomite, for the Edomites are related to you. Do not despise an Egyptian, because you resided as foreigners in their country.  "
"5509","Deuteronomy","23","8","The third generation of children born to them may enter the assembly of the  Lord . "
"5510","Deuteronomy","23","9","When you are encamped against your enemies, keep away from everything impure.  "
"5511","Deuteronomy","23","10","If one of your men is unclean because of a nocturnal emission, he is to go outside the camp and stay there.  "
"5512","Deuteronomy","23","11","But as evening approaches he is to wash himself, and at sunset he may return to the camp. "
"5513","Deuteronomy","23","12","Designate a place outside the camp where you can go to relieve yourself.  "
"5514","Deuteronomy","23","13","As part of your equipment have something to dig with, and when you relieve yourself, dig a hole and cover up your excrement.  "
"5515","Deuteronomy","23","14","For the  Lord  your God moves about in your camp to protect you and to deliver your enemies to you. Your camp must be holy, so that he will not see among you anything indecent and turn away from you. "
"5516","Deuteronomy","23","15","If a slave has taken refuge with you, do not hand them over to their master.  "
"5517","Deuteronomy","23","16","Let them live among you wherever they like and in whatever town they choose. Do not oppress them. "
"5518","Deuteronomy","23","17","No Israelite man or woman is to become a shrine prostitute.  "
"5519","Deuteronomy","23","18","You must not bring the earnings of a female prostitute or of a male prostitute  into the house of the  Lord  your God to pay any vow, because the  Lord  your God detests them both. "
"5520","Deuteronomy","23","19","Do not charge a fellow Israelite interest, whether on money or food or anything else that may earn interest.  "
"5521","Deuteronomy","23","20","You may charge a foreigner interest, but not a fellow Israelite, so that the  Lord  your God may bless you in everything you put your hand to in the land you are entering to possess. "
"5522","Deuteronomy","23","21","If you make a vow to the  Lord  your God, do not be slow to pay it, for the  Lord  your God will certainly demand it of you and you will be guilty of sin.  "
"5523","Deuteronomy","23","22","But if you refrain from making a vow, you will not be guilty.  "
"5524","Deuteronomy","23","23","Whatever your lips utter you must be sure to do, because you made your vow freely to the  Lord  your God with your own mouth. "
"5525","Deuteronomy","23","24","If you enter your neighbor’s vineyard, you may eat all the grapes you want, but do not put any in your basket.  "
"5526","Deuteronomy","23","25","If you enter your neighbor’s grainfield, you may pick kernels with your hands, but you must not put a sickle to their standing grain."
"5527","Deuteronomy","24","1","If a man marries a woman who becomes displeasing to him because he finds something indecent about her, and he writes her a certificate of divorce, gives it to her and sends her from his house,  "
"5528","Deuteronomy","24","2","and if after she leaves his house she becomes the wife of another man,  "
"5529","Deuteronomy","24","3","and her second husband dislikes her and writes her a certificate of divorce, gives it to her and sends her from his house, or if he dies,  "
"5530","Deuteronomy","24","4","then her first husband, who divorced her, is not allowed to marry her again after she has been defiled. That would be detestable in the eyes of the  Lord . Do not bring sin upon the land the  Lord  your God is giving you as an inheritance. "
"5531","Deuteronomy","24","5","If a man has recently married, he must not be sent to war or have any other duty laid on him. For one year he is to be free to stay at home and bring happiness to the wife he has married. "
"5532","Deuteronomy","24","6","Do not take a pair of millstones—not even the upper one—as security for a debt, because that would be taking a person’s livelihood as security. "
"5533","Deuteronomy","24","7","If someone is caught kidnapping a fellow Israelite and treating or selling them as a slave, the kidnapper must die. You must purge the evil from among you. "
"5534","Deuteronomy","24","8","In cases of defiling skin diseases,  be very careful to do exactly as the Levitical priests instruct you. You must follow carefully what I have commanded them.  "

"5538","Deuteronomy","24","12","If the neighbor is poor, do not go to sleep with their pledge in your possession.  "
"5539","Deuteronomy","24","13","Return their cloak by sunset so that your neighbor may sleep in it. Then they will thank you, and it will be regarded as a righteous act in the sight of the  Lord  your God. "
"5540","Deuteronomy","24","14","Do not take advantage of a hired worker who is poor and needy, whether that worker is a fellow Israelite or a foreigner residing in one of your towns.  "
"5541","Deuteronomy","24","15","Pay them their wages each day before sunset, because they are poor and are counting on it. Otherwise they may cry to the  Lord  against you, and you will be guilty of sin. "
"5542","Deuteronomy","24","16","Parents are not to be put to death for their children, nor children put to death for their parents; each will die for their own sin. "

"5549","Deuteronomy","25","1","When people have a dispute, they are to take it to court and the judges will decide the case, acquitting the innocent and condemning the guilty.  "

"5553","Deuteronomy","25","5","If brothers are living together and one of them dies without a son, his widow must not marry outside the family. Her husband’s brother shall take her and marry her and fulfill the duty of a brother-in-law to her.  "
"5554","Deuteronomy","25","6","The first son she bears shall carry on the name of the dead brother so that his name will not be blotted out from Israel. "
"5555","Deuteronomy","25","7","However, if a man does not want to marry his brother’s wife, she shall go to the elders at the town gate and say, “My husband’s brother refuses to carry on his brother’s name in Israel. He will not fulfill the duty of a brother-in-law to me.”  "
"5556","Deuteronomy","25","8","Then the elders of his town shall summon him and talk to him. If he persists in saying, “I do not want to marry her,”  "
"5557","Deuteronomy","25","9","his brother’s widow shall go up to him in the presence of the elders, take off one of his sandals, spit in his face and say, “This is what is done to the man who will not build up his brother’s family line.”  "
"5558","Deuteronomy","25","10","That man’s line shall be known in Israel as The Family of the Unsandaled. "
"5559","Deuteronomy","25","11","If two men are fighting and the wife of one of them comes to rescue her husband from his assailant, and she reaches out and seizes him by his private parts,  "

"5566","Deuteronomy","25","18","When you were weary and worn out, they met you on your journey and attacked all who were lagging behind; they had no fear of God.  "

"5570","Deuteronomy","26","3","and say to the priest in office at the time, “I declare today to the  Lord  your God that I have come to the land the  Lord  swore to our ancestors to give us.”  "
"5571","Deuteronomy","26","4","The priest shall take the basket from your hands and set it down in front of the altar of the  Lord  your God.  "
"5572","Deuteronomy","26","5","Then you shall declare before the  Lord  your God: “My father was a wandering Aramean, and he went down into Egypt with a few people and lived there and became a great nation, powerful and numerous.  "

"5578","Deuteronomy","26","11","Then you and the Levites and the foreigners residing among you shall rejoice in all the good things the  Lord  your God has given to you and your household. "
"5579","Deuteronomy","26","12","When you have finished setting aside a tenth of all your produce in the third year, the year of the tithe, you shall give it to the Levite, the foreigner, the fatherless and the widow, so that they may eat in your towns and be satisfied.  "
"5580","Deuteronomy","26","13","Then say to the  Lord  your God: “I have removed from my house the sacred portion and have given it to the Levite, the foreigner, the fatherless and the widow, according to all you commanded.

"5581","Deuteronomy","26","14","I have not eaten any of the sacred portion while I was in mourning, nor have I removed any of it while I was unclean, nor have I offered any of it to the dead. I have obeyed the  Lord  my God; I have done everything you commanded me.  "

"5613","Deuteronomy","28","1","If you fully obey the  Lord  your God and carefully follow all his commands I give you today, the  Lord  your God will set you high above all the nations on earth.  "
"5614","Deuteronomy","28","2","All these blessings will come on you and accompany you if you obey the  Lord  your God: "
"5615","Deuteronomy","28","3","You will be blessed in the city and blessed in the country. "
"5616","Deuteronomy","28","4","The fruit of your womb will be blessed, and the crops of your land and the young of your livestock—the calves of your herds and the lambs of your flocks. "
"5617","Deuteronomy","28","5","Your basket and your kneading trough will be blessed. "
"5618","Deuteronomy","28","6","You will be blessed when you come in and blessed when you go out. "
"5619","Deuteronomy","28","7","The  Lord  will grant that the enemies who rise up against you will be defeated before you. They will come at you from one direction but flee from you in seven. "
"5620","Deuteronomy","28","8","The  Lord  will send a blessing on your barns and on everything you put your hand to. The  Lord  your God will bless you in the land he is giving you. "
"5621","Deuteronomy","28","9","The  Lord  will establish you as his holy people, as he promised you on oath, if you keep the commands of the  Lord  your God and walk in obedience to him.  "
"5622","Deuteronomy","28","10","Then all the peoples on earth will see that you are called by the name of the  Lord , and they will fear you.  "
"5623","Deuteronomy","28","11","The  Lord  will grant you abundant prosperity—in the fruit of your womb, the young of your livestock and the crops of your ground—in the land he swore to your ancestors to give you. "
"5624","Deuteronomy","28","12","The  Lord  will open the heavens, the storehouse of his bounty, to send rain on your land in season and to bless all the work of your hands. You will lend to many nations but will borrow from none.  "
"5625","Deuteronomy","28","13","The  Lord  will make you the head, not the tail. If you pay attention to the commands of the  Lord  your God that I give you this day and carefully follow them, you will always be at the top, never at the bottom.  "
"5626","Deuteronomy","28","14","Do not turn aside from any of the commands I give you today, to the right or to the left, following other gods and serving them. "
"5627","Deuteronomy","28","15","However, if you do not obey the  Lord  your God and do not carefully follow all his commands and decrees I am giving you today, all these curses will come on you and overtake you: "
"5628","Deuteronomy","28","16","You will be cursed in the city and cursed in the country. "
"5629","Deuteronomy","28","17","Your basket and your kneading trough will be cursed. "
"5630","Deuteronomy","28","18","The fruit of your womb will be cursed, and the crops of your land, and the calves of your herds and the lambs of your flocks. "
"5631","Deuteronomy","28","19","You will be cursed when you come in and cursed when you go out. "
"5632","Deuteronomy","28","20","The  Lord  will send on you curses, confusion and rebuke in everything you put your hand to, until you are destroyed and come to sudden ruin because of the evil you have done in forsaking him.   "
"5633","Deuteronomy","28","21","The  Lord  will plague you with diseases until he has destroyed you from the land you are entering to possess.  "
"5634","Deuteronomy","28","22","The  Lord  will strike you with wasting disease, with fever and inflammation, with scorching heat and drought, with blight and mildew, which will plague you until you perish.  "
"5635","Deuteronomy","28","23","The sky over your head will be bronze, the ground beneath you iron.  "
"5636","Deuteronomy","28","24","The  Lord  will turn the rain of your country into dust and powder; it will come down from the skies until you are destroyed. "
"5637","Deuteronomy","28","25","The  Lord  will cause you to be defeated before your enemies. You will come at them from one direction but flee from them in seven, and you will become a thing of horror to all the kingdoms on earth.  "
"5638","Deuteronomy","28","26","Your carcasses will be food for all the birds and the wild animals, and there will be no one to frighten them away.  "
"5639","Deuteronomy","28","27","The  Lord  will afflict you with the boils of Egypt and with tumors, festering sores and the itch, from which you cannot be cured.  "
"5640","Deuteronomy","28","28","The  Lord  will afflict you with madness, blindness and confusion of mind.  "
"5641","Deuteronomy","28","29","At midday you will grope about like a blind person in the dark. You will be unsuccessful in everything you do; day after day you will be oppressed and robbed, with no one to rescue you. "
"5642","Deuteronomy","28","30","You will be pledged to be married to a woman, but another will take her and rape her. You will build a house, but you will not live in it. You will plant a vineyard, but you will not even begin to enjoy its fruit.  "
"5643","Deuteronomy","28","31","Your ox will be slaughtered before your eyes, but you will eat none of it. Your donkey will be forcibly taken from you and will not be returned. Your sheep will be given to your enemies, and no one will rescue them.  "
"5644","Deuteronomy","28","32","Your sons and daughters will be given to another nation, and you will wear out your eyes watching for them day after day, powerless to lift a hand.  "
"5645","Deuteronomy","28","33","A people that you do not know will eat what your land and labor produce, and you will have nothing but cruel oppression all your days.  "
"5646","Deuteronomy","28","34","The sights you see will drive you mad.  "
"5647","Deuteronomy","28","35","The  Lord  will afflict your knees and legs with painful boils that cannot be cured, spreading from the soles of your feet to the top of your head. "
"5648","Deuteronomy","28","36","The  Lord  will drive you and the king you set over you to a nation unknown to you or your ancestors. There you will worship other gods, gods of wood and stone.  "
"5649","Deuteronomy","28","37","You will become a thing of horror, a byword and an object of ridicule among all the peoples where the  Lord  will drive you. "
"5650","Deuteronomy","28","38","You will sow much seed in the field but you will harvest little, because locusts will devour it.  "
"5651","Deuteronomy","28","39","You will plant vineyards and cultivate them but you will not drink the wine or gather the grapes, because worms will eat them.  "
"5652","Deuteronomy","28","40","You will have olive trees throughout your country but you will not use the oil, because the olives will drop off.  "
"5653","Deuteronomy","28","41","You will have sons and daughters but you will not keep them, because they will go into captivity.  "
"5654","Deuteronomy","28","42","Swarms of locusts will take over all your trees and the crops of your land. "
"5655","Deuteronomy","28","43","The foreigners who reside among you will rise above you higher and higher, but you will sink lower and lower.  "
"5656","Deuteronomy","28","44","They will lend to you, but you will not lend to them. They will be the head, but you will be the tail. "
"5657","Deuteronomy","28","45","All these curses will come on you. They will pursue you and overtake you until you are destroyed, because you did not obey the  Lord  your God and observe the commands and decrees he gave you.  "
"5658","Deuteronomy","28","46","They will be a sign and a wonder to you and your descendants forever.  "
"5659","Deuteronomy","28","47","Because you did not serve the  Lord  your God joyfully and gladly in the time of prosperity,  "
"5660","Deuteronomy","28","48","therefore in hunger and thirst, in nakedness and dire poverty, you will serve the enemies the  Lord  sends against you. He will put an iron yoke on your neck until he has destroyed you. "
"5661","Deuteronomy","28","49","The  Lord  will bring a nation against you from far away, from the ends of the earth, like an eagle swooping down, a nation whose language you will not understand,  "
"5662","Deuteronomy","28","50","a fierce-looking nation without respect for the old or pity for the young.  "
"5663","Deuteronomy","28","51","They will devour the young of your livestock and the crops of your land until you are destroyed. They will leave you no grain, new wine or olive oil, nor any calves of your herds or lambs of your flocks until you are ruined.  "
"5664","Deuteronomy","28","52","They will lay siege to all the cities throughout your land until the high fortified walls in which you trust fall down. They will besiege all the cities throughout the land the  Lord  your God is giving you. "
"5665","Deuteronomy","28","53","Because of the suffering your enemy will inflict on you during the siege, you will eat the fruit of the womb, the flesh of the sons and daughters the  Lord  your God has given you.  "
"5666","Deuteronomy","28","54","Even the most gentle and sensitive man among you will have no compassion on his own brother or the wife he loves or his surviving children,  "
"5667","Deuteronomy","28","55","and he will not give to one of them any of the flesh of his children that he is eating. It will be all he has left because of the suffering your enemy will inflict on you during the siege of all your cities.  "
"5668","Deuteronomy","28","56","The most gentle and sensitive woman among you—so sensitive and gentle that she would not venture to touch the ground with the sole of her foot—will begrudge the husband she loves and her own son or daughter  "
"5669","Deuteronomy","28","57","the afterbirth from her womb and the children she bears. For in her dire need she intends to eat them secretly because of the suffering your enemy will inflict on you during the siege of your cities. "
"5670","Deuteronomy","28","58","If you do not carefully follow all the words of this law, which are written in this book, and do not revere this glorious and awesome name—the  Lord  your God—  "
"5671","Deuteronomy","28","59","the  Lord  will send fearful plagues on you and your descendants, harsh and prolonged disasters, and severe and lingering illnesses.  "
"5672","Deuteronomy","28","60","He will bring on you all the diseases of Egypt that you dreaded, and they will cling to you.  "
"5673","Deuteronomy","28","61","The  Lord  will also bring on you every kind of sickness and disaster not recorded in this Book of the Law, until you are destroyed.  "
"5674","Deuteronomy","28","62","You who were as numerous as the stars in the sky will be left but few in number, because you did not obey the  Lord  your God.  "
"5675","Deuteronomy","28","63","Just as it pleased the  Lord  to make you prosper and increase in number, so it will please him to ruin and destroy you. You will be uprooted from the land you are entering to possess. "
"5676","Deuteronomy","28","64","Then the  Lord  will scatter you among all nations, from one end of the earth to the other. There you will worship other gods—gods of wood and stone, which neither you nor your ancestors have known.  "
"5677","Deuteronomy","28","65","Among those nations you will find no repose, no resting place for the sole of your foot. There the  Lord  will give you an anxious mind, eyes weary with longing, and a despairing heart.  "
"5678","Deuteronomy","28","66","You will live in constant suspense, filled with dread both night and day, never sure of your life.  "
"5679","Deuteronomy","28","67","In the morning you will say, “If only it were evening!” and in the evening, “If only it were morning!”—because of the terror that will fill your hearts and the sights that your eyes will see.  "
"5680","Deuteronomy","28","68","The  Lord  will send you back in ships to Egypt on a journey I said you should never make again. There you will offer yourselves for sale to your enemies as male and female slaves, but no one will buy you."
"5681","Deuteronomy","29","1","These are the terms of the covenant the  Lord  commanded Moses to make with the Israelites in Moab, in addition to the covenant he had made with them at Horeb. "
"5682","Deuteronomy","29","2","Moses summoned all the Israelites and said to them: Your eyes have seen all that the  Lord  did in Egypt to Pharaoh, to all his officials and to all his land.  "
"5683","Deuteronomy","29","3","With your own eyes you saw those great trials, those signs and great wonders.  "
"5684","Deuteronomy","29","4","But to this day the  Lord  has not given you a mind that understands or eyes that see or ears that hear.  "
"5685","Deuteronomy","29","5","Yet the  Lord  says, “During the forty years that I led you through the wilderness, your clothes did not wear out, nor did the sandals on your feet.  "
"5686","Deuteronomy","29","6","You ate no bread and drank no wine or other fermented drink. I did this so that you might know that I am the  Lord  your God.” "
"5687","Deuteronomy","29","7","When you reached this place, Sihon king of Heshbon and Og king of Bashan came out to fight against us, but we defeated them.  "
"5688","Deuteronomy","29","8","We took their land and gave it as an inheritance to the Reubenites, the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh. "
"5689","Deuteronomy","29","9","Carefully follow the terms of this covenant, so that you may prosper in everything you do.  "
"5690","Deuteronomy","29","10","All of you are standing today in the presence of the  Lord  your God—your leaders and chief men, your elders and officials, and all the other men of Israel,  "
"5691","Deuteronomy","29","11","together with your children and your wives, and the foreigners living in your camps who chop your wood and carry your water.  "
"5692","Deuteronomy","29","12","You are standing here in order to enter into a covenant with the  Lord  your God, a covenant the  Lord  is making with you this day and sealing with an oath,  "
"5693","Deuteronomy","29","13","to confirm you this day as his people, that he may be your God as he promised you and as he swore to your fathers, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.  "
"5694","Deuteronomy","29","14","I am making this covenant, with its oath, not only with you  "
"5695","Deuteronomy","29","15","who are standing here with us today in the presence of the  Lord  our God but also with those who are not here today. "
"5696","Deuteronomy","29","16","You yourselves know how we lived in Egypt and how we passed through the countries on the way here.  "
"5697","Deuteronomy","29","17","You saw among them their detestable images and idols of wood and stone, of silver and gold.  "
"5698","Deuteronomy","29","18","Make sure there is no man or woman, clan or tribe among you today whose heart turns away from the  Lord  our God to go and worship the gods of those nations; make sure there is no root among you that produces such bitter poison. "
"5699","Deuteronomy","29","19","When such a person hears the words of this oath and they invoke a blessing on themselves, thinking, “I will be safe, even though I persist in going my own way,” they will bring disaster on the watered land as well as the dry.  "
"5700","Deuteronomy","29","20","The  Lord  will never be willing to forgive them; his wrath and zeal will burn against them. All the curses written in this book will fall on them, and the  Lord  will blot out their names from under heaven.  "
"5701","Deuteronomy","29","21","The  Lord  will single them out from all the tribes of Israel for disaster, according to all the curses of the covenant written in this Book of the Law. "
"5702","Deuteronomy","29","22","Your children who follow you in later generations and foreigners who come from distant lands will see the calamities that have fallen on the land and the diseases with which the  Lord  has afflicted it.  "
"5703","Deuteronomy","29","23","The whole land will be a burning waste of salt and sulfur—nothing planted, nothing sprouting, no vegetation growing on it. It will be like the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboyim, which the  Lord  overthrew in fierce anger.  "
"5704","Deuteronomy","29","24","All the nations will ask: “Why has the  Lord  done this to this land? Why this fierce, burning anger?” "
"5705","Deuteronomy","29","25","And the answer will be: “It is because this people abandoned the covenant of the  Lord , the God of their ancestors, the covenant he made with them when he brought them out of Egypt.  "
"5706","Deuteronomy","29","26","They went off and worshiped other gods and bowed down to them, gods they did not know, gods he had not given them.  "
"5707","Deuteronomy","29","27","Therefore the  Lord ’s anger burned against this land, so that he brought on it all the curses written in this book.  "
"5708","Deuteronomy","29","28","In furious anger and in great wrath the  Lord  uprooted them from their land and thrust them into another land, as it is now.” "
"5709","Deuteronomy","29","29","The secret things belong to the  Lord  our God, but the things revealed belong to us and to our children forever, that we may follow all the words of this law."
"5710","Deuteronomy","30","1","When all these blessings and curses I have set before you come on you and you take them to heart wherever the  Lord  your God disperses you among the nations,  "
"5711","Deuteronomy","30","2","and when you and your children return to the  Lord  your God and obey him with all your heart and with all your soul according to everything I command you today,  "
"5712","Deuteronomy","30","3","then the  Lord  your God will restore your fortunes  and have compassion on you and gather you again from all the nations where he scattered you.  "
"5713","Deuteronomy","30","4","Even if you have been banished to the most distant land under the heavens, from there the  Lord  your God will gather you and bring you back.  "
"5714","Deuteronomy","30","5","He will bring you to the land that belonged to your ancestors, and you will take possession of it. He will make you more prosperous and numerous than your ancestors.  "
"5715","Deuteronomy","30","6","The  Lord  your God will circumcise your hearts and the hearts of your descendants, so that you may love him with all your heart and with all your soul, and live.  "
"5716","Deuteronomy","30","7","The  Lord  your God will put all these curses on your enemies who hate and persecute you.  "
"5717","Deuteronomy","30","8","You will again obey the  Lord  and follow all his commands I am giving you today.  "
"5718","Deuteronomy","30","9","Then the  Lord  your God will make you most prosperous in all the work of your hands and in the fruit of your womb, the young of your livestock and the crops of your land. The  Lord  will again delight in you and make you prosperous, just as he delighted in your ancestors,  "
"5719","Deuteronomy","30","10","if you obey the  Lord  your God and keep his commands and decrees that are written in this Book of the Law and turn to the  Lord  your God with all your heart and with all your soul. "
"5720","Deuteronomy","30","11","Now what I am commanding you today is not too difficult for you or beyond your reach.  "
"5721","Deuteronomy","30","12","It is not up in heaven, so that you have to ask, “Who will ascend into heaven to get it and proclaim it to us so we may obey it?”  "
"5722","Deuteronomy","30","13","Nor is it beyond the sea, so that you have to ask, “Who will cross the sea to get it and proclaim it to us so we may obey it?”  "
"5723","Deuteronomy","30","14","No, the word is very near you; it is in your mouth and in your heart so you may obey it. "
"5724","Deuteronomy","30","15","See, I set before you today life and prosperity, death and destruction.  "
"5725","Deuteronomy","30","16","For I command you today to love the  Lord  your God, to walk in obedience to him, and to keep his commands, decrees and laws; then you will live and increase, and the  Lord  your God will bless you in the land you are entering to possess. "
"5726","Deuteronomy","30","17","But if your heart turns away and you are not obedient, and if you are drawn away to bow down to other gods and worship them,  "
"5727","Deuteronomy","30","18","I declare to you this day that you will certainly be destroyed. You will not live long in the land you are crossing the Jordan to enter and possess. "
"5728","Deuteronomy","30","19","This day I call the heavens and the earth as witnesses against you that I have set before you life and death, blessings and curses. Now choose life, so that you and your children may live  "
"5729","Deuteronomy","30","20","and that you may love the  Lord  your God, listen to his voice, and hold fast to him. For the  Lord  is your life, and he will give you many years in the land he swore to give to your fathers, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob."
"5730","Deuteronomy","31","1","Then Moses went out and spoke these words to all Israel:  "
"5731","Deuteronomy","31","2","“I am now a hundred and twenty years old and I am no longer able to lead you. The  Lord  has said to me, ‘You shall not cross the Jordan.’  "
"5732","Deuteronomy","31","3","The  Lord  your God himself will cross over ahead of you. He will destroy these nations before you, and you will take possession of their land. Joshua also will cross over ahead of you, as the  Lord  said.  "
"5733","Deuteronomy","31","4","And the  Lord  will do to them what he did to Sihon and Og, the kings of the Amorites, whom he destroyed along with their land.  "
"5734","Deuteronomy","31","5","The  Lord  will deliver them to you, and you must do to them all that I have commanded you.  "
"5735","Deuteronomy","31","6","Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid or terrified because of them, for the  Lord  your God goes with you; he will never leave you nor forsake you.” "
"5736","Deuteronomy","31","7","Then Moses summoned Joshua and said to him in the presence of all Israel, “Be strong and courageous, for you must go with this people into the land that the  Lord  swore to their ancestors to give them, and you must divide it among them as their inheritance.  "
"5737","Deuteronomy","31","8","The  Lord  himself goes before you and will be with you; he will never leave you nor forsake you. Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged.” "
"5738","Deuteronomy","31","9","So Moses wrote down this law and gave it to the Levitical priests, who carried the ark of the covenant of the  Lord , and to all the elders of Israel.  "
"5739","Deuteronomy","31","10","Then Moses commanded them: “At the end of every seven years, in the year for canceling debts, during the Festival of Tabernacles,  "
"5740","Deuteronomy","31","11","when all Israel comes to appear before the  Lord  your God at the place he will choose, you shall read this law before them in their hearing.  "
"5741","Deuteronomy","31","12","Assemble the people—men, women and children, and the foreigners residing in your towns—so they can listen and learn to fear the  Lord  your God and follow carefully all the words of this law.  "
"5742","Deuteronomy","31","13","Their children, who do not know this law, must hear it and learn to fear the  Lord  your God as long as you live in the land you are crossing the Jordan to possess.” "
"5743","Deuteronomy","31","14","The  Lord  said to Moses, “Now the day of your death is near. Call Joshua and present yourselves at the tent of meeting, where I will commission him.” So Moses and Joshua came and presented themselves at the tent of meeting. "
"5744","Deuteronomy","31","15","Then the  Lord  appeared at the tent in a pillar of cloud, and the cloud stood over the entrance to the tent.  "
"5745","Deuteronomy","31","16","And the  Lord  said to Moses: “You are going to rest with your ancestors, and these people will soon prostitute themselves to the foreign gods of the land they are entering. They will forsake me and break the covenant I made with them.  "
"5746","Deuteronomy","31","17","And in that day I will become angry with them and forsake them; I will hide my face from them, and they will be destroyed. Many disasters and calamities will come on them, and in that day they will ask, ‘Have not these disasters come on us because our God is not with us?’  "
"5747","Deuteronomy","31","18","And I will certainly hide my face in that day because of all their wickedness in turning to other gods. "
"5748","Deuteronomy","31","19","“Now write down this song and teach it to the Israelites and have them sing it, so that it may be a witness for me against them.  "
"5749","Deuteronomy","31","20","When I have brought them into the land flowing with milk and honey, the land I promised on oath to their ancestors, and when they eat their fill and thrive, they will turn to other gods and worship them, rejecting me and breaking my covenant.  "
"5750","Deuteronomy","31","21","And when many disasters and calamities come on them, this song will testify against them, because it will not be forgotten by their descendants. I know what they are disposed to do, even before I bring them into the land I promised them on oath.”  "
"5751","Deuteronomy","31","22","So Moses wrote down this song that day and taught it to the Israelites. "
"5752","Deuteronomy","31","23","The  Lord  gave this command to Joshua son of Nun: “Be strong and courageous, for you will bring the Israelites into the land I promised them on oath, and I myself will be with you.” "
"5753","Deuteronomy","31","24","After Moses finished writing in a book the words of this law from beginning to end,  "
"5754","Deuteronomy","31","25","he gave this command to the Levites who carried the ark of the covenant of the  Lord :  "
"5755","Deuteronomy","31","26","“Take this Book of the Law and place it beside the ark of the covenant of the  Lord  your God. There it will remain as a witness against you.  "
"5756","Deuteronomy","31","27","For I know how rebellious and stiff-necked you are. If you have been rebellious against the  Lord  while I am still alive and with you, how much more will you rebel after I die!  "
"5757","Deuteronomy","31","28","Assemble before me all the elders of your tribes and all your officials, so that I can speak these words in their hearing and call the heavens and the earth to testify against them.  "
"5758","Deuteronomy","31","29","For I know that after my death you are sure to become utterly corrupt and to turn from the way I have commanded you. In days to come, disaster will fall on you because you will do evil in the sight of the  Lord  and arouse his anger by what your hands have made.” "
"5759","Deuteronomy","31","30","And Moses recited the words of this song from beginning to end in the hearing of the whole assembly of Israel:"
"5760","Deuteronomy","32","1","Listen, you heavens, and I will speak; hear, you earth, the words of my mouth. "
"5761","Deuteronomy","32","2","Let my teaching fall like rain and my words descend like dew, like showers on new grass, like abundant rain on tender plants. "
"5762","Deuteronomy","32","3","I will proclaim the name of the  Lord . Oh, praise the greatness of our God! "
"5763","Deuteronomy","32","4","He is the Rock, his works are perfect, and all his ways are just. A faithful God who does no wrong, upright and just is he. "
"5764","Deuteronomy","32","5","They are corrupt and not his children; to their shame they are a warped and crooked generation. "
"5765","Deuteronomy","32","6","Is this the way you repay the  Lord , you foolish and unwise people? Is he not your Father, your Creator, who made you and formed you? "
"5766","Deuteronomy","32","7","Remember the days of old; consider the generations long past. Ask your father and he will tell you, your elders, and they will explain to you. "
"5767","Deuteronomy","32","8","When the Most High gave the nations their inheritance, when he divided all mankind, he set up boundaries for the peoples according to the number of the sons of Israel. "
"5768","Deuteronomy","32","9","For the  Lord ’s portion is his people, Jacob his allotted inheritance. "
"5769","Deuteronomy","32","10","In a desert land he found him, in a barren and howling waste. He shielded him and cared for him; he guarded him as the apple of his eye, "
"5770","Deuteronomy","32","11","like an eagle that stirs up its nest and hovers over its young, that spreads its wings to catch them and carries them aloft. "
"5771","Deuteronomy","32","12","The  Lord  alone led him; no foreign god was with him. "
"5772","Deuteronomy","32","13","He made him ride on the heights of the land and fed him with the fruit of the fields. He nourished him with honey from the rock, and with oil from the flinty crag, "
"5773","Deuteronomy","32","14","with curds and milk from herd and flock and with fattened lambs and goats, with choice rams of Bashan and the finest kernels of wheat. You drank the foaming blood of the grape. "
"5774","Deuteronomy","32","15","Jeshurun  grew fat and kicked; filled with food, they became heavy and sleek. They abandoned the God who made them and rejected the Rock their Savior. "
"5775","Deuteronomy","32","16","They made him jealous with their foreign gods and angered him with their detestable idols. "
"5776","Deuteronomy","32","17","They sacrificed to false gods, which are not God— gods they had not known, gods that recently appeared, gods your ancestors did not fear. "
"5777","Deuteronomy","32","18","You deserted the Rock, who fathered you; you forgot the God who gave you birth. "
"5778","Deuteronomy","32","19","The  Lord  saw this and rejected them because he was angered by his sons and daughters. "
"5779","Deuteronomy","32","20","“I will hide my face from them,” he said, “and see what their end will be; for they are a perverse generation, children who are unfaithful. "
"5780","Deuteronomy","32","21","They made me jealous by what is no god and angered me with their worthless idols. I will make them envious by those who are not a people; I will make them angry by a nation that has no understanding. "
"5781","Deuteronomy","32","22","For a fire will be kindled by my wrath, one that burns down to the realm of the dead below. It will devour the earth and its harvests and set afire the foundations of the mountains. "
"5782","Deuteronomy","32","23","“I will heap calamities on them and spend my arrows against them. "
"5783","Deuteronomy","32","24","I will send wasting famine against them, consuming pestilence and deadly plague; I will send against them the fangs of wild beasts, the venom of vipers that glide in the dust. "
"5784","Deuteronomy","32","25","In the street the sword will make them childless; in their homes terror will reign. The young men and young women will perish, the infants and those with gray hair. "
"5785","Deuteronomy","32","26","I said I would scatter them and erase their name from human memory, "
"5786","Deuteronomy","32","27","but I dreaded the taunt of the enemy, lest the adversary misunderstand and say, ‘Our hand has triumphed; the  Lord  has not done all this.’ ” "
"5787","Deuteronomy","32","28","They are a nation without sense, there is no discernment in them. "
"5788","Deuteronomy","32","29","If only they were wise and would understand this and discern what their end will be! "
"5789","Deuteronomy","32","30","How could one man chase a thousand, or two put ten thousand to flight, unless their Rock had sold them, unless the  Lord  had given them up? "
"5790","Deuteronomy","32","31","For their rock is not like our Rock, as even our enemies concede. "
"5791","Deuteronomy","32","32","Their vine comes from the vine of Sodom and from the fields of Gomorrah. Their grapes are filled with poison, and their clusters with bitterness. "
"5792","Deuteronomy","32","33","Their wine is the venom of serpents, the deadly poison of cobras. "
"5793","Deuteronomy","32","34","“Have I not kept this in reserve and sealed it in my vaults? "
"5794","Deuteronomy","32","35","It is mine to avenge; I will repay. In due time their foot will slip; their day of disaster is near and their doom rushes upon them.” "
"5795","Deuteronomy","32","36","The  Lord  will vindicate his people and relent concerning his servants when he sees their strength is gone and no one is left, slave or free. "
"5796","Deuteronomy","32","37","He will say: “Now where are their gods, the rock they took refuge in, "
"5797","Deuteronomy","32","38","the gods who ate the fat of their sacrifices and drank the wine of their drink offerings? Let them rise up to help you! Let them give you shelter! "
"5798","Deuteronomy","32","39","“See now that I myself am he! There is no god besides me. I put to death and I bring to life, I have wounded and I will heal, and no one can deliver out of my hand. "
"5799","Deuteronomy","32","40","I lift my hand to heaven and solemnly swear: As surely as I live forever, "
"5800","Deuteronomy","32","41","when I sharpen my flashing sword and my hand grasps it in judgment, I will take vengeance on my adversaries and repay those who hate me. "
"5801","Deuteronomy","32","42","I will make my arrows drunk with blood, while my sword devours flesh: the blood of the slain and the captives, the heads of the enemy leaders.” "
"5802","Deuteronomy","32","43","Rejoice, you nations, with his people, for he will avenge the blood of his servants; he will take vengeance on his enemies and make atonement for his land and people. "
"5803","Deuteronomy","32","44","Moses came with Joshua  son of Nun and spoke all the words of this song in the hearing of the people.  "
"5804","Deuteronomy","32","45","When Moses finished reciting all these words to all Israel,  "
"5805","Deuteronomy","32","46","he said to them, “Take to heart all the words I have solemnly declared to you this day, so that you may command your children to obey carefully all the words of this law.  "
"5806","Deuteronomy","32","47","They are not just idle words for you—they are your life. By them you will live long in the land you are crossing the Jordan to possess.” "
"5807","Deuteronomy","32","48","On that same day the  Lord  told Moses,  "
"5808","Deuteronomy","32","49","“Go up into the Abarim Range to Mount Nebo in Moab, across from Jericho, and view Canaan, the land I am giving the Israelites as their own possession.  "
"5809","Deuteronomy","32","50","There on the mountain that you have climbed you will die and be gathered to your people, just as your brother Aaron died on Mount Hor and was gathered to his people.  "
"5810","Deuteronomy","32","51","This is because both of you broke faith with me in the presence of the Israelites at the waters of Meribah Kadesh in the Desert of Zin and because you did not uphold my holiness among the Israelites.  "
"5811","Deuteronomy","32","52","Therefore, you will see the land only from a distance; you will not enter the land I am giving to the people of Israel.”"
"5812","Deuteronomy","33","1","This is the blessing that Moses the man of God pronounced on the Israelites before his death.  "
"5813","Deuteronomy","33","2","He said: “The  Lord  came from Sinai and dawned over them from Seir; he shone forth from Mount Paran. He came with  myriads of holy ones from the south, from his mountain slopes. "
"5814","Deuteronomy","33","3","Surely it is you who love the people; all the holy ones are in your hand. At your feet they all bow down, and from you receive instruction, "
"5815","Deuteronomy","33","4","the law that Moses gave us, the possession of the assembly of Jacob. "
"5816","Deuteronomy","33","5","He was king over Jeshurun when the leaders of the people assembled, along with the tribes of Israel. "
"5817","Deuteronomy","33","6","“Let Reuben live and not die, nor  his people be few.” "
"5818","Deuteronomy","33","7","And this he said about Judah: “Hear,  Lord , the cry of Judah; bring him to his people. With his own hands he defends his cause. Oh, be his help against his foes!” "
"5819","Deuteronomy","33","8","About Levi he said: “Your Thummim and Urim belong to your faithful servant. You tested him at Massah; you contended with him at the waters of Meribah. "
"5820","Deuteronomy","33","9","He said of his father and mother, ‘I have no regard for them.’ He did not recognize his brothers or acknowledge his own children, but he watched over your word and guarded your covenant. "
"5821","Deuteronomy","33","10","He teaches your precepts to Jacob and your law to Israel. He offers incense before you and whole burnt offerings on your altar. "
"5822","Deuteronomy","33","11","Bless all his skills,  Lord , and be pleased with the work of his hands. Strike down those who rise against him, his foes till they rise no more.” "
"5823","Deuteronomy","33","12","About Benjamin he said: “Let the beloved of the  Lord  rest secure in him, for he shields him all day long, and the one the  Lord  loves rests between his shoulders.” "
"5824","Deuteronomy","33","13","About Joseph he said: “May the  Lord  bless his land with the precious dew from heaven above and with the deep waters that lie below; "
"5825","Deuteronomy","33","14","with the best the sun brings forth and the finest the moon can yield; "
"5826","Deuteronomy","33","15","with the choicest gifts of the ancient mountains and the fruitfulness of the everlasting hills; "
"5827","Deuteronomy","33","16","with the best gifts of the earth and its fullness and the favor of him who dwelt in the burning bush. Let all these rest on the head of Joseph, on the brow of the prince among  his brothers. "
"5828","Deuteronomy","33","17","In majesty he is like a firstborn bull; his horns are the horns of a wild ox. With them he will gore the nations, even those at the ends of the earth. Such are the ten thousands of Ephraim; such are the thousands of Manasseh.” "
"5829","Deuteronomy","33","18","About Zebulun he said: “Rejoice, Zebulun, in your going out, and you, Issachar, in your tents. "
"5830","Deuteronomy","33","19","They will summon peoples to the mountain and there offer the sacrifices of the righteous; they will feast on the abundance of the seas, on the treasures hidden in the sand.” "
"5831","Deuteronomy","33","20","About Gad he said: “Blessed is he who enlarges Gad’s domain! Gad lives there like a lion, tearing at arm or head. "
"5832","Deuteronomy","33","21","He chose the best land for himself; the leader’s portion was kept for him. When the heads of the people assembled, he carried out the  Lord ’s righteous will, and his judgments concerning Israel.” "
"5833","Deuteronomy","33","22","About Dan he said: “Dan is a lion’s cub, springing out of Bashan.” "
"5834","Deuteronomy","33","23","About Naphtali he said: “Naphtali is abounding with the favor of the  Lord and is full of his blessing; he will inherit southward to the lake.” "
"5835","Deuteronomy","33","24","About Asher he said: “Most blessed of sons is Asher; let him be favored by his brothers, and let him bathe his feet in oil. "
"5836","Deuteronomy","33","25","The bolts of your gates will be iron and bronze, and your strength will equal your days. "
"5837","Deuteronomy","33","26","“There is no one like the God of Jeshurun, who rides across the heavens to help you and on the clouds in his majesty. "
"5838","Deuteronomy","33","27","The eternal God is your refuge, and underneath are the everlasting arms. He will drive out your enemies before you, saying, ‘Destroy them!’ "
"5839","Deuteronomy","33","28","So Israel will live in safety; Jacob will dwell  secure in a land of grain and new wine, where the heavens drop dew. "
"5840","Deuteronomy","33","29","Blessed are you, Israel! Who is like you, a people saved by the  Lord ? He is your shield and helper and your glorious sword. Your enemies will cower before you, and you will tread on their heights.”"
"5841","Deuteronomy","34","1","Then Moses climbed Mount Nebo from the plains of Moab to the top of Pisgah, across from Jericho. There the  Lord  showed him the whole land—from Gilead to Dan,  "
"5842","Deuteronomy","34","2","all of Naphtali, the territory of Ephraim and Manasseh, all the land of Judah as far as the Mediterranean Sea,  "
"5843","Deuteronomy","34","3","the Negev and the whole region from the Valley of Jericho, the City of Palms, as far as Zoar.  "
"5844","Deuteronomy","34","4","Then the  Lord  said to him, “This is the land I promised on oath to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob when I said, ‘I will give it to your descendants.’ I have let you see it with your eyes, but you will not cross over into it.” "
"5845","Deuteronomy","34","5","And Moses the servant of the  Lord  died there in Moab, as the  Lord  had said.  "
"5846","Deuteronomy","34","6","He buried him  in Moab, in the valley opposite Beth Peor, but to this day no one knows where his grave is.  "
"5847","Deuteronomy","34","7","Moses was a hundred and twenty years old when he died, yet his eyes were not weak nor his strength gone.  "
"5848","Deuteronomy","34","8","The Israelites grieved for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days, until the time of weeping and mourning was over. "
"5849","Deuteronomy","34","9","Now Joshua son of Nun was filled with the spirit  of wisdom because Moses had laid his hands on him. So the Israelites listened to him and did what the  Lord  had commanded Moses. "
"5850","Deuteronomy","34","10","Since then, no prophet has risen in Israel like Moses, whom the  Lord  knew face to face,  "
"5851","Deuteronomy","34","11","who did all those signs and wonders the  Lord  sent him to do in Egypt—to Pharaoh and to all his officials and to his whole land.  "
"5852","Deuteronomy","34","12","For no one has ever shown the mighty power or performed the awesome deeds that Moses did in the sight of all Israel."
"5853","Joshua","1","1","After the death of Moses the servant of the  Lord , the  Lord  said to Joshua son of Nun, Moses’ aide:  "
"5854","Joshua","1","2","“Moses my servant is dead. Now then, you and all these people, get ready to cross the Jordan River into the land I am about to give to them—to the Israelites.  "
"5855","Joshua","1","3","I will give you every place where you set your foot, as I promised Moses.  "
"5856","Joshua","1","4","Your territory will extend from the desert to Lebanon, and from the great river, the Euphrates—all the Hittite country—to the Mediterranean Sea in the west.  "
"5857","Joshua","1","5","No one will be able to stand against you all the days of your life. As I was with Moses, so I will be with you; I will never leave you nor forsake you.  "
"5858","Joshua","1","6","Be strong and courageous, because you will lead these people to inherit the land I swore to their ancestors to give them. "
"5859","Joshua","1","7","“Be strong and very courageous. Be careful to obey all the law my servant Moses gave you; do not turn from it to the right or to the left, that you may be successful wherever you go.  "
"5860","Joshua","1","8","Keep this Book of the Law always on your lips; meditate on it day and night, so that you may be careful to do everything written in it. Then you will be prosperous and successful.  "
"5861","Joshua","1","9","Have I not commanded you? Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged, for the  Lord  your God will be with you wherever you go.” "
"5862","Joshua","1","10","So Joshua ordered the officers of the people:  "
"5863","Joshua","1","11","“Go through the camp and tell the people, ‘Get your provisions ready. Three days from now you will cross the Jordan here to go in and take possession of the land the  Lord  your God is giving you for your own.’ ” "
"5864","Joshua","1","12","But to the Reubenites, the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh, Joshua said,  "
"5865","Joshua","1","13","“Remember the command that Moses the servant of the  Lord  gave you after he said, ‘The  Lord  your God will give you rest by giving you this land.’  "
"5866","Joshua","1","14","Your wives, your children and your livestock may stay in the land that Moses gave you east of the Jordan, but all your fighting men, ready for battle, must cross over ahead of your fellow Israelites. You are to help them  "
"5867","Joshua","1","15","until the  Lord  gives them rest, as he has done for you, and until they too have taken possession of the land the  Lord  your God is giving them. After that, you may go back and occupy your own land, which Moses the servant of the  Lord  gave you east of the Jordan toward the sunrise.” "
"5868","Joshua","1","16","Then they answered Joshua, “Whatever you have commanded us we will do, and wherever you send us we will go.  "
"5869","Joshua","1","17","Just as we fully obeyed Moses, so we will obey you. Only may the  Lord  your God be with you as he was with Moses.  "
"5870","Joshua","1","18","Whoever rebels against your word and does not obey it, whatever you may command them, will be put to death. Only be strong and courageous!”"
"5871","Joshua","2","1","Then Joshua son of Nun secretly sent two spies from Shittim. “Go, look over the land,” he said, “especially Jericho.” So they went and entered the house of a prostitute named Rahab and stayed there. "
"5872","Joshua","2","2","The king of Jericho was told, “Look, some of the Israelites have come here tonight to spy out the land.”  "
"5873","Joshua","2","3","So the king of Jericho sent this message to Rahab: “Bring out the men who came to you and entered your house, because they have come to spy out the whole land.” "
"5874","Joshua","2","4","But the woman had taken the two men and hidden them. She said, “Yes, the men came to me, but I did not know where they had come from.  "
"5875","Joshua","2","5","At dusk, when it was time to close the city gate, they left. I don’t know which way they went. Go after them quickly. You may catch up with them.”  "
"5876","Joshua","2","6","(But she had taken them up to the roof and hidden them under the stalks of flax she had laid out on the roof.)  "
"5877","Joshua","2","7","So the men set out in pursuit of the spies on the road that leads to the fords of the Jordan, and as soon as the pursuers had gone out, the gate was shut. "
"5878","Joshua","2","8","Before the spies lay down for the night, she went up on the roof  "
"5879","Joshua","2","9","and said to them, “I know that the  Lord  has given you this land and that a great fear of you has fallen on us, so that all who live in this country are melting in fear because of you.  "
"5880","Joshua","2","10","We have heard how the  Lord  dried up the water of the Red Sea  for you when you came out of Egypt, and what you did to Sihon and Og, the two kings of the Amorites east of the Jordan, whom you completely destroyed.   "
"5881","Joshua","2","11","When we heard of it, our hearts melted in fear and everyone’s courage failed because of you, for the  Lord  your God is God in heaven above and on the earth below. "
"5882","Joshua","2","12","“Now then, please swear to me by the  Lord  that you will show kindness to my family, because I have shown kindness to you. Give me a sure sign  "
"5883","Joshua","2","13","that you will spare the lives of my father and mother, my brothers and sisters, and all who belong to them—and that you will save us from death.” "
"5884","Joshua","2","14","“Our lives for your lives!” the men assured her. “If you don’t tell what we are doing, we will treat you kindly and faithfully when the  Lord  gives us the land.” "
"5885","Joshua","2","15","So she let them down by a rope through the window, for the house she lived in was part of the city wall.  "
"5886","Joshua","2","16","She said to them, “Go to the hills so the pursuers will not find you. Hide yourselves there three days until they return, and then go on your way.” "
"5887","Joshua","2","17","Now the men had said to her, “This oath you made us swear will not be binding on us  "
"5888","Joshua","2","18","unless, when we enter the land, you have tied this scarlet cord in the window through which you let us down, and unless you have brought your father and mother, your brothers and all your family into your house.  "
"5889","Joshua","2","19","If any of them go outside your house into the street, their blood will be on their own heads; we will not be responsible. As for those who are in the house with you, their blood will be on our head if a hand is laid on them.  "
"5890","Joshua","2","20","But if you tell what we are doing, we will be released from the oath you made us swear.” "
"5891","Joshua","2","21","“Agreed,” she replied. “Let it be as you say.” So she sent them away, and they departed. And she tied the scarlet cord in the window. "
"5892","Joshua","2","22","When they left, they went into the hills and stayed there three days, until the pursuers had searched all along the road and returned without finding them.  "
"5893","Joshua","2","23","Then the two men started back. They went down out of the hills, forded the river and came to Joshua son of Nun and told him everything that had happened to them.  "
"5894","Joshua","2","24","They said to Joshua, “The  Lord  has surely given the whole land into our hands; all the people are melting in fear because of us.”"
"5895","Joshua","3","1","Early in the morning Joshua and all the Israelites set out from Shittim and went to the Jordan, where they camped before crossing over.  "
"5896","Joshua","3","2","After three days the officers went throughout the camp,  "
"5897","Joshua","3","3","giving orders to the people: “When you see the ark of the covenant of the  Lord  your God, and the Levitical priests carrying it, you are to move out from your positions and follow it.  "
"5898","Joshua","3","4","Then you will know which way to go, since you have never been this way before. But keep a distance of about two thousand cubits  between you and the ark; do not go near it.” "
"5899","Joshua","3","5","Joshua told the people, “Consecrate yourselves, for tomorrow the  Lord  will do amazing things among you.” "
"5900","Joshua","3","6","Joshua said to the priests, “Take up the ark of the covenant and pass on ahead of the people.” So they took it up and went ahead of them. "
"5901","Joshua","3","7","And the  Lord  said to Joshua, “Today I will begin to exalt you in the eyes of all Israel, so they may know that I am with you as I was with Moses.  "
"5902","Joshua","3","8","Tell the priests who carry the ark of the covenant: ‘When you reach the edge of the Jordan’s waters, go and stand in the river.’ ” "
"5903","Joshua","3","9","Joshua said to the Israelites, “Come here and listen to the words of the  Lord  your God.  "
"5904","Joshua","3","10","This is how you will know that the living God is among you and that he will certainly drive out before you the Canaanites, Hittites, Hivites, Perizzites, Girgashites, Amorites and Jebusites.  "
"5905","Joshua","3","11","See, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth will go into the Jordan ahead of you.  "
"5906","Joshua","3","12","Now then, choose twelve men from the tribes of Israel, one from each tribe.  "
"5907","Joshua","3","13","And as soon as the priests who carry the ark of the  Lord —the Lord of all the earth—set foot in the Jordan, its waters flowing downstream will be cut off and stand up in a heap.” "
"5908","Joshua","3","14","So when the people broke camp to cross the Jordan, the priests carrying the ark of the covenant went ahead of them.  "
"5909","Joshua","3","15","Now the Jordan is at flood stage all during harvest. Yet as soon as the priests who carried the ark reached the Jordan and their feet touched the water’s edge,  "
"5910","Joshua","3","16","the water from upstream stopped flowing. It piled up in a heap a great distance away, at a town called Adam in the vicinity of Zarethan, while the water flowing down to the Sea of the Arabah (that is, the Dead Sea) was completely cut off. So the people crossed over opposite Jericho.  "
"5911","Joshua","3","17","The priests who carried the ark of the covenant of the  Lord  stopped in the middle of the Jordan and stood on dry ground, while all Israel passed by until the whole nation had completed the crossing on dry ground."
"5912","Joshua","4","1","When the whole nation had finished crossing the Jordan, the  Lord  said to Joshua,  "
"5913","Joshua","4","2","“Choose twelve men from among the people, one from each tribe,  "
"5914","Joshua","4","3","and tell them to take up twelve stones from the middle of the Jordan, from right where the priests are standing, and carry them over with you and put them down at the place where you stay tonight.” "
"5915","Joshua","4","4","So Joshua called together the twelve men he had appointed from the Israelites, one from each tribe,  "
"5916","Joshua","4","5","and said to them, “Go over before the ark of the  Lord  your God into the middle of the Jordan. Each of you is to take up a stone on his shoulder, according to the number of the tribes of the Israelites,  "
"5917","Joshua","4","6","to serve as a sign among you. In the future, when your children ask you, ‘What do these stones mean?’  "
"5918","Joshua","4","7","tell them that the flow of the Jordan was cut off before the ark of the covenant of the  Lord . When it crossed the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan were cut off. These stones are to be a memorial to the people of Israel forever.” "
"5919","Joshua","4","8","So the Israelites did as Joshua commanded them. They took twelve stones from the middle of the Jordan, according to the number of the tribes of the Israelites, as the  Lord  had told Joshua; and they carried them over with them to their camp, where they put them down.  "
"5920","Joshua","4","9","Joshua set up the twelve stones that had been  in the middle of the Jordan at the spot where the priests who carried the ark of the covenant had stood. And they are there to this day. "
"5921","Joshua","4","10","Now the priests who carried the ark remained standing in the middle of the Jordan until everything the  Lord  had commanded Joshua was done by the people, just as Moses had directed Joshua. The people hurried over,  "
"5922","Joshua","4","11","and as soon as all of them had crossed, the ark of the  Lord  and the priests came to the other side while the people watched.  "
"5923","Joshua","4","12","The men of Reuben, Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh crossed over, ready for battle, in front of the Israelites, as Moses had directed them.  "
"5924","Joshua","4","13","About forty thousand armed for battle crossed over before the  Lord  to the plains of Jericho for war. "
"5925","Joshua","4","14","That day the  Lord  exalted Joshua in the sight of all Israel; and they stood in awe of him all the days of his life, just as they had stood in awe of Moses. "
"5926","Joshua","4","15","Then the  Lord  said to Joshua,  "
"5927","Joshua","4","16","“Command the priests carrying the ark of the covenant law to come up out of the Jordan.” "
"5928","Joshua","4","17","So Joshua commanded the priests, “Come up out of the Jordan.” "
"5929","Joshua","4","18","And the priests came up out of the river carrying the ark of the covenant of the  Lord . No sooner had they set their feet on the dry ground than the waters of the Jordan returned to their place and ran at flood stage as before. "
"5930","Joshua","4","19","On the tenth day of the first month the people went up from the Jordan and camped at Gilgal on the eastern border of Jericho.  "
"5931","Joshua","4","20","And Joshua set up at Gilgal the twelve stones they had taken out of the Jordan.  "
"5932","Joshua","4","21","He said to the Israelites, “In the future when your descendants ask their parents, ‘What do these stones mean?’  "
"5933","Joshua","4","22","tell them, ‘Israel crossed the Jordan on dry ground.’  "
"5934","Joshua","4","23","For the  Lord  your God dried up the Jordan before you until you had crossed over. The  Lord  your God did to the Jordan what he had done to the Red Sea  when he dried it up before us until we had crossed over.  "
"5935","Joshua","4","24","He did this so that all the peoples of the earth might know that the hand of the  Lord  is powerful and so that you might always fear the  Lord  your God.”"
"5936","Joshua","5","1","Now when all the Amorite kings west of the Jordan and all the Canaanite kings along the coast heard how the  Lord  had dried up the Jordan before the Israelites until they  had crossed over, their hearts melted in fear and they no longer had the courage to face the Israelites. "
"5937","Joshua","5","2","At that time the  Lord  said to Joshua, “Make flint knives and circumcise the Israelites again.”  "
"5938","Joshua","5","3","So Joshua made flint knives and circumcised the Israelites at Gibeath Haaraloth. "
"5939","Joshua","5","4","Now this is why he did so: All those who came out of Egypt—all the men of military age—died in the wilderness on the way after leaving Egypt.  "
"5940","Joshua","5","5","All the people that came out had been circumcised, but all the people born in the wilderness during the journey from Egypt had not.  "
"5941","Joshua","5","6","The Israelites had moved about in the wilderness forty years until all the men who were of military age when they left Egypt had died, since they had not obeyed the  Lord . For the  Lord  had sworn to them that they would not see the land he had solemnly promised their ancestors to give us, a land flowing with milk and honey.  "
"5942","Joshua","5","7","So he raised up their sons in their place, and these were the ones Joshua circumcised. They were still uncircumcised because they had not been circumcised on the way.  "
"5943","Joshua","5","8","And after the whole nation had been circumcised, they remained where they were in camp until they were healed. "
"5944","Joshua","5","9","Then the  Lord  said to Joshua, “Today I have rolled away the reproach of Egypt from you.” So the place has been called Gilgal  to this day. "
"5945","Joshua","5","10","On the evening of the fourteenth day of the month, while camped at Gilgal on the plains of Jericho, the Israelites celebrated the Passover.  "
"5946","Joshua","5","11","The day after the Passover, that very day, they ate some of the produce of the land: unleavened bread and roasted grain.  "
"5947","Joshua","5","12","The manna stopped the day after  they ate this food from the land; there was no longer any manna for the Israelites, but that year they ate the produce of Canaan. "
"5948","Joshua","5","13","Now when Joshua was near Jericho, he looked up and saw a man standing in front of him with a drawn sword in his hand. Joshua went up to him and asked, “Are you for us or for our enemies?” "
"5949","Joshua","5","14","“Neither,” he replied, “but as commander of the army of the  Lord  I have now come.” Then Joshua fell facedown to the ground in reverence, and asked him, “What message does my Lord  have for his servant?” "
"5950","Joshua","5","15","The commander of the  Lord ’s army replied, “Take off your sandals, for the place where you are standing is holy.” And Joshua did so."
"5951","Joshua","6","1","Now the gates of Jericho were securely barred because of the Israelites. No one went out and no one came in. "
"5952","Joshua","6","2","Then the  Lord  said to Joshua, “See, I have delivered Jericho into your hands, along with its king and its fighting men.  "
"5953","Joshua","6","3","March around the city once with all the armed men. Do this for six days.  "
"5954","Joshua","6","4","Have seven priests carry trumpets of rams’ horns in front of the ark. On the seventh day, march around the city seven times, with the priests blowing the trumpets.  "
"5955","Joshua","6","5","When you hear them sound a long blast on the trumpets, have the whole army give a loud shout; then the wall of the city will collapse and the army will go up, everyone straight in.” "
"5956","Joshua","6","6","So Joshua son of Nun called the priests and said to them, “Take up the ark of the covenant of the  Lord  and have seven priests carry trumpets in front of it.”  "
"5957","Joshua","6","7","And he ordered the army, “Advance! March around the city, with an armed guard going ahead of the ark of the  Lord .” "
"5958","Joshua","6","8","When Joshua had spoken to the people, the seven priests carrying the seven trumpets before the  Lord  went forward, blowing their trumpets, and the ark of the  Lord ’s covenant followed them.  "
"5959","Joshua","6","9","The armed guard marched ahead of the priests who blew the trumpets, and the rear guard followed the ark. All this time the trumpets were sounding.  "
"5960","Joshua","6","10","But Joshua had commanded the army, “Do not give a war cry, do not raise your voices, do not say a word until the day I tell you to shout. Then shout!”  "
"5961","Joshua","6","11","So he had the ark of the  Lord  carried around the city, circling it once. Then the army returned to camp and spent the night there. "
"5962","Joshua","6","12","Joshua got up early the next morning and the priests took up the ark of the  Lord .  "
"5963","Joshua","6","13","The seven priests carrying the seven trumpets went forward, marching before the ark of the  Lord  and blowing the trumpets. The armed men went ahead of them and the rear guard followed the ark of the  Lord , while the trumpets kept sounding.  "
"5964","Joshua","6","14","So on the second day they marched around the city once and returned to the camp. They did this for six days. "
"5965","Joshua","6","15","On the seventh day, they got up at daybreak and marched around the city seven times in the same manner, except that on that day they circled the city seven times.  "
"5966","Joshua","6","16","The seventh time around, when the priests sounded the trumpet blast, Joshua commanded the army, “Shout! For the  Lord  has given you the city!  "
"5967","Joshua","6","17","The city and all that is in it are to be devoted  to the  Lord . Only Rahab the prostitute and all who are with her in her house shall be spared, because she hid the spies we sent.  "
"5968","Joshua","6","18","But keep away from the devoted things, so that you will not bring about your own destruction by taking any of them. Otherwise you will make the camp of Israel liable to destruction and bring trouble on it.  "
"5969","Joshua","6","19","All the silver and gold and the articles of bronze and iron are sacred to the  Lord  and must go into his treasury.” "
"5970","Joshua","6","20","When the trumpets sounded, the army shouted, and at the sound of the trumpet, when the men gave a loud shout, the wall collapsed; so everyone charged straight in, and they took the city.  "
"5971","Joshua","6","21","They devoted the city to the  Lord  and destroyed with the sword every living thing in it—men and women, young and old, cattle, sheep and donkeys. "
"5972","Joshua","6","22","Joshua said to the two men who had spied out the land, “Go into the prostitute’s house and bring her out and all who belong to her, in accordance with your oath to her.”  "
"5973","Joshua","6","23","So the young men who had done the spying went in and brought out Rahab, her father and mother, her brothers and sisters and all who belonged to her. They brought out her entire family and put them in a place outside the camp of Israel. "
"5974","Joshua","6","24","Then they burned the whole city and everything in it, but they put the silver and gold and the articles of bronze and iron into the treasury of the  Lord ’s house.  "
"5975","Joshua","6","25","But Joshua spared Rahab the prostitute, with her family and all who belonged to her, because she hid the men Joshua had sent as spies to Jericho—and she lives among the Israelites to this day. "
"5976","Joshua","6","26","At that time Joshua pronounced this solemn oath: “Cursed before the  Lord  is the one who undertakes to rebuild this city, Jericho: “At the cost of his firstborn son he will lay its foundations; at the cost of his youngest he will set up its gates.” "
"5977","Joshua","6","27","So the  Lord  was with Joshua, and his fame spread throughout the land."
"5978","Joshua","7","1","But the Israelites were unfaithful in regard to the devoted things ; Achan son of Karmi, the son of Zimri,  the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took some of them. So the  Lord ’s anger burned against Israel. "
"5979","Joshua","7","2","Now Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is near Beth Aven to the east of Bethel, and told them, “Go up and spy out the region.” So the men went up and spied out Ai. "
"5980","Joshua","7","3","When they returned to Joshua, they said, “Not all the army will have to go up against Ai. Send two or three thousand men to take it and do not weary the whole army, for only a few people live there.”  "
"5981","Joshua","7","4","So about three thousand went up; but they were routed by the men of Ai,  "
"5982","Joshua","7","5","who killed about thirty-six of them. They chased the Israelites from the city gate as far as the stone quarries and struck them down on the slopes. At this the hearts of the people melted in fear and became like water. "
"5983","Joshua","7","6","Then Joshua tore his clothes and fell facedown to the ground before the ark of the  Lord , remaining there till evening. The elders of Israel did the same, and sprinkled dust on their heads.  "
"5984","Joshua","7","7","And Joshua said, “Alas, Sovereign  Lord , why did you ever bring this people across the Jordan to deliver us into the hands of the Amorites to destroy us? If only we had been content to stay on the other side of the Jordan!  "
"5985","Joshua","7","8","Pardon your servant, Lord. What can I say, now that Israel has been routed by its enemies?  "
"5986","Joshua","7","9","The Canaanites and the other people of the country will hear about this and they will surround us and wipe out our name from the earth. What then will you do for your own great name?” "
"5987","Joshua","7","10","The  Lord  said to Joshua, “Stand up! What are you doing down on your face?  "
"5988","Joshua","7","11","Israel has sinned; they have violated my covenant, which I commanded them to keep. They have taken some of the devoted things; they have stolen, they have lied, they have put them with their own possessions.  "
"5989","Joshua","7","12","That is why the Israelites cannot stand against their enemies; they turn their backs and run because they have been made liable to destruction. I will not be with you anymore unless you destroy whatever among you is devoted to destruction. "
"5990","Joshua","7","13","“Go, consecrate the people. Tell them, ‘Consecrate yourselves in preparation for tomorrow; for this is what the  Lord , the God of Israel, says: There are devoted things among you, Israel. You cannot stand against your enemies until you remove them. "
"5991","Joshua","7","14","“ ‘In the morning, present yourselves tribe by tribe. The tribe the  Lord  chooses shall come forward clan by clan; the clan the  Lord  chooses shall come forward family by family; and the family the  Lord  chooses shall come forward man by man.  "
"5992","Joshua","7","15","Whoever is caught with the devoted things shall be destroyed by fire, along with all that belongs to him. He has violated the covenant of the  Lord  and has done an outrageous thing in Israel!’ ” "
"5993","Joshua","7","16","Early the next morning Joshua had Israel come forward by tribes, and Judah was chosen.  "
"5994","Joshua","7","17","The clans of Judah came forward, and the Zerahites were chosen. He had the clan of the Zerahites come forward by families, and Zimri was chosen.  "
"5995","Joshua","7","18","Joshua had his family come forward man by man, and Achan son of Karmi, the son of Zimri, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was chosen. "
"5996","Joshua","7","19","Then Joshua said to Achan, “My son, give glory to the  Lord , the God of Israel, and honor him. Tell me what you have done; do not hide it from me.” "
"5997","Joshua","7","20","Achan replied, “It is true! I have sinned against the  Lord , the God of Israel. This is what I have done:  "
"5998","Joshua","7","21","When I saw in the plunder a beautiful robe from Babylonia,  two hundred shekels  of silver and a bar of gold weighing fifty shekels,  I coveted them and took them. They are hidden in the ground inside my tent, with the silver underneath.” "
"5999","Joshua","7","22","So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent, and there it was, hidden in his tent, with the silver underneath.  "
"6000","Joshua","7","23","They took the things from the tent, brought them to Joshua and all the Israelites and spread them out before the  Lord . "
"6001","Joshua","7","24","Then Joshua, together with all Israel, took Achan son of Zerah, the silver, the robe, the gold bar, his sons and daughters, his cattle, donkeys and sheep, his tent and all that he had, to the Valley of Achor.  "
"6002","Joshua","7","25","Joshua said, “Why have you brought this trouble on us? The  Lord  will bring trouble on you today.” Then all Israel stoned him, and after they had stoned the rest, they burned them.  "
"6003","Joshua","7","26","Over Achan they heaped up a large pile of rocks, which remains to this day. Then the  Lord  turned from his fierce anger. Therefore that place has been called the Valley of Achor  ever since."
"6004","Joshua","8","1","Then the  Lord  said to Joshua, “Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged. Take the whole army with you, and go up and attack Ai. For I have delivered into your hands the king of Ai, his people, his city and his land.  "
"6005","Joshua","8","2","You shall do to Ai and its king as you did to Jericho and its king, except that you may carry off their plunder and livestock for yourselves. Set an ambush behind the city.” "
"6006","Joshua","8","3","So Joshua and the whole army moved out to attack Ai. He chose thirty thousand of his best fighting men and sent them out at night  "
"6007","Joshua","8","4","with these orders: “Listen carefully. You are to set an ambush behind the city. Don’t go very far from it. All of you be on the alert.  "
"6008","Joshua","8","5","I and all those with me will advance on the city, and when the men come out against us, as they did before, we will flee from them.  "
"6009","Joshua","8","6","They will pursue us until we have lured them away from the city, for they will say, ‘They are running away from us as they did before.’ So when we flee from them,  "
"6010","Joshua","8","7","you are to rise up from ambush and take the city. The  Lord  your God will give it into your hand.  "
"6011","Joshua","8","8","When you have taken the city, set it on fire. Do what the  Lord  has commanded. See to it; you have my orders.” "
"6012","Joshua","8","9","Then Joshua sent them off, and they went to the place of ambush and lay in wait between Bethel and Ai, to the west of Ai—but Joshua spent that night with the people. "
"6013","Joshua","8","10","Early the next morning Joshua mustered his army, and he and the leaders of Israel marched before them to Ai.  "
"6014","Joshua","8","11","The entire force that was with him marched up and approached the city and arrived in front of it. They set up camp north of Ai, with the valley between them and the city.  "
"6015","Joshua","8","12","Joshua had taken about five thousand men and set them in ambush between Bethel and Ai, to the west of the city.  "
"6016","Joshua","8","13","So the soldiers took up their positions—with the main camp to the north of the city and the ambush to the west of it. That night Joshua went into the valley. "
"6017","Joshua","8","14","When the king of Ai saw this, he and all the men of the city hurried out early in the morning to meet Israel in battle at a certain place overlooking the Arabah. But he did not know that an ambush had been set against him behind the city.  "
"6018","Joshua","8","15","Joshua and all Israel let themselves be driven back before them, and they fled toward the wilderness.  "
"6019","Joshua","8","16","All the men of Ai were called to pursue them, and they pursued Joshua and were lured away from the city.  "
"6020","Joshua","8","17","Not a man remained in Ai or Bethel who did not go after Israel. They left the city open and went in pursuit of Israel. "
"6021","Joshua","8","18","Then the  Lord  said to Joshua, “Hold out toward Ai the javelin that is in your hand, for into your hand I will deliver the city.” So Joshua held out toward the city the javelin that was in his hand.  "
"6022","Joshua","8","19","As soon as he did this, the men in the ambush rose quickly from their position and rushed forward. They entered the city and captured it and quickly set it on fire. "
"6023","Joshua","8","20","The men of Ai looked back and saw the smoke of the city rising up into the sky, but they had no chance to escape in any direction; the Israelites who had been fleeing toward the wilderness had turned back against their pursuers.  "
"6024","Joshua","8","21","For when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city and that smoke was going up from it, they turned around and attacked the men of Ai.  "
"6025","Joshua","8","22","Those in the ambush also came out of the city against them, so that they were caught in the middle, with Israelites on both sides. Israel cut them down, leaving them neither survivors nor fugitives.  "
"6026","Joshua","8","23","But they took the king of Ai alive and brought him to Joshua. "
"6027","Joshua","8","24","When Israel had finished killing all the men of Ai in the fields and in the wilderness where they had chased them, and when every one of them had been put to the sword, all the Israelites returned to Ai and killed those who were in it.  "
"6028","Joshua","8","25","Twelve thousand men and women fell that day—all the people of Ai.  "
"6029","Joshua","8","26","For Joshua did not draw back the hand that held out his javelin until he had destroyed  all who lived in Ai.  "
"6030","Joshua","8","27","But Israel did carry off for themselves the livestock and plunder of this city, as the  Lord  had instructed Joshua. "
"6031","Joshua","8","28","So Joshua burned Ai  and made it a permanent heap of ruins, a desolate place to this day.  "
"6032","Joshua","8","29","He impaled the body of the king of Ai on a pole and left it there until evening. At sunset, Joshua ordered them to take the body from the pole and throw it down at the entrance of the city gate. And they raised a large pile of rocks over it, which remains to this day. "
"6033","Joshua","8","30","Then Joshua built on Mount Ebal an altar to the  Lord , the God of Israel,  "
"6034","Joshua","8","31","as Moses the servant of the  Lord  had commanded the Israelites. He built it according to what is written in the Book of the Law of Moses—an altar of uncut stones, on which no iron tool had been used. On it they offered to the  Lord  burnt offerings and sacrificed fellowship offerings.  "
"6035","Joshua","8","32","There, in the presence of the Israelites, Joshua wrote on stones a copy of the law of Moses.  "
"6036","Joshua","8","33","All the Israelites, with their elders, officials and judges, were standing on both sides of the ark of the covenant of the  Lord , facing the Levitical priests who carried it. Both the foreigners living among them and the native-born were there. Half of the people stood in front of Mount Gerizim and half of them in front of Mount Ebal, as Moses the servant of the  Lord  had formerly commanded when he gave instructions to bless the people of Israel. "
"6037","Joshua","8","34","Afterward, Joshua read all the words of the law—the blessings and the curses—just as it is written in the Book of the Law.  "
"6038","Joshua","8","35","There was not a word of all that Moses had commanded that Joshua did not read to the whole assembly of Israel, including the women and children, and the foreigners who lived among them."
"6039","Joshua","9","1","Now when all the kings west of the Jordan heard about these things—the kings in the hill country, in the western foothills, and along the entire coast of the Mediterranean Sea as far as Lebanon (the kings of the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites)—  "
"6040","Joshua","9","2","they came together to wage war against Joshua and Israel. "
"6041","Joshua","9","3","However, when the people of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and Ai,  "
"6042","Joshua","9","4","they resorted to a ruse: They went as a delegation whose donkeys were loaded  with worn-out sacks and old wineskins, cracked and mended.  "
"6043","Joshua","9","5","They put worn and patched sandals on their feet and wore old clothes. All the bread of their food supply was dry and moldy.  "
"6044","Joshua","9","6","Then they went to Joshua in the camp at Gilgal and said to him and the Israelites, “We have come from a distant country; make a treaty with us.” "
"6045","Joshua","9","7","The Israelites said to the Hivites, “But perhaps you live near us, so how can we make a treaty with you?” "
"6046","Joshua","9","8","“We are your servants,” they said to Joshua. But Joshua asked, “Who are you and where do you come from?” "
"6047","Joshua","9","9","They answered: “Your servants have come from a very distant country because of the fame of the  Lord  your God. For we have heard reports of him: all that he did in Egypt,  "
"6048","Joshua","9","10","and all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites east of the Jordan—Sihon king of Heshbon, and Og king of Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth.  "
"6049","Joshua","9","11","And our elders and all those living in our country said to us, ‘Take provisions for your journey; go and meet them and say to them, “We are your servants; make a treaty with us.” ’  "
"6050","Joshua","9","12","This bread of ours was warm when we packed it at home on the day we left to come to you. But now see how dry and moldy it is.  "
"6051","Joshua","9","13","And these wineskins that we filled were new, but see how cracked they are. And our clothes and sandals are worn out by the very long journey.” "
"6052","Joshua","9","14","The Israelites sampled their provisions but did not inquire of the  Lord .  "
"6053","Joshua","9","15","Then Joshua made a treaty of peace with them to let them live, and the leaders of the assembly ratified it by oath. "
"6054","Joshua","9","16","Three days after they made the treaty with the Gibeonites, the Israelites heard that they were neighbors, living near them.  "
"6055","Joshua","9","17","So the Israelites set out and on the third day came to their cities: Gibeon, Kephirah, Beeroth and Kiriath Jearim.  "
"6056","Joshua","9","18","But the Israelites did not attack them, because the leaders of the assembly had sworn an oath to them by the  Lord , the God of Israel. The whole assembly grumbled against the leaders,  "
"6057","Joshua","9","19","but all the leaders answered, “We have given them our oath by the  Lord , the God of Israel, and we cannot touch them now.  "
"6058","Joshua","9","20","This is what we will do to them: We will let them live, so that God’s wrath will not fall on us for breaking the oath we swore to them.”  "
"6059","Joshua","9","21","They continued, “Let them live, but let them be woodcutters and water carriers in the service of the whole assembly.” So the leaders’ promise to them was kept. "
"6060","Joshua","9","22","Then Joshua summoned the Gibeonites and said, “Why did you deceive us by saying, ‘We live a long way from you,’ while actually you live near us?  "
"6061","Joshua","9","23","You are now under a curse: You will never be released from service as woodcutters and water carriers for the house of my God.” "
"6062","Joshua","9","24","They answered Joshua, “Your servants were clearly told how the  Lord  your God had commanded his servant Moses to give you the whole land and to wipe out all its inhabitants from before you. So we feared for our lives because of you, and that is why we did this.  "
"6063","Joshua","9","25","We are now in your hands. Do to us whatever seems good and right to you.” "
"6064","Joshua","9","26","So Joshua saved them from the Israelites, and they did not kill them.  "
"6065","Joshua","9","27","That day he made the Gibeonites woodcutters and water carriers for the assembly, to provide for the needs of the altar of the  Lord  at the place the  Lord  would choose. And that is what they are to this day."
"6066","Joshua","10","1","Now Adoni-Zedek king of Jerusalem heard that Joshua had taken Ai and totally destroyed  it, doing to Ai and its king as he had done to Jericho and its king, and that the people of Gibeon had made a treaty of peace with Israel and had become their allies.  "
"6067","Joshua","10","2","He and his people were very much alarmed at this, because Gibeon was an important city, like one of the royal cities; it was larger than Ai, and all its men were good fighters.  "
"6068","Joshua","10","3","So Adoni-Zedek king of Jerusalem appealed to Hoham king of Hebron, Piram king of Jarmuth, Japhia king of Lachish and Debir king of Eglon.  "
"6069","Joshua","10","4","“Come up and help me attack Gibeon,” he said, “because it has made peace with Joshua and the Israelites.” "
"6070","Joshua","10","5","Then the five kings of the Amorites—the kings of Jerusalem, Hebron, Jarmuth, Lachish and Eglon—joined forces. They moved up with all their troops and took up positions against Gibeon and attacked it. "
"6071","Joshua","10","6","The Gibeonites then sent word to Joshua in the camp at Gilgal: “Do not abandon your servants. Come up to us quickly and save us! Help us, because all the Amorite kings from the hill country have joined forces against us.” "
"6072","Joshua","10","7","So Joshua marched up from Gilgal with his entire army, including all the best fighting men.  "
"6073","Joshua","10","8","The  Lord  said to Joshua, “Do not be afraid of them; I have given them into your hand. Not one of them will be able to withstand you.” "
"6074","Joshua","10","9","After an all-night march from Gilgal, Joshua took them by surprise.  "
"6075","Joshua","10","10","The  Lord  threw them into confusion before Israel, so Joshua and the Israelites defeated them completely at Gibeon. Israel pursued them along the road going up to Beth Horon and cut them down all the way to Azekah and Makkedah.  "
"6076","Joshua","10","11","As they fled before Israel on the road down from Beth Horon to Azekah, the  Lord  hurled large hailstones down on them, and more of them died from the hail than were killed by the swords of the Israelites. "
"6077","Joshua","10","12","On the day the  Lord  gave the Amorites over to Israel, Joshua said to the  Lord  in the presence of Israel: “Sun, stand still over Gibeon, and you, moon, over the Valley of Aijalon.” "
"6078","Joshua","10","13","So the sun stood still, and the moon stopped, till the nation avenged itself on  its enemies, as it is written in the Book of Jashar. The sun stopped in the middle of the sky and delayed going down about a full day.  "
"6079","Joshua","10","14","There has never been a day like it before or since, a day when the  Lord  listened to a human being. Surely the  Lord  was fighting for Israel! "
"6080","Joshua","10","15","Then Joshua returned with all Israel to the camp at Gilgal. "
"6081","Joshua","10","16","Now the five kings had fled and hidden in the cave at Makkedah.  "
"6082","Joshua","10","17","When Joshua was told that the five kings had been found hiding in the cave at Makkedah,  "
"6083","Joshua","10","18","he said, “Roll large rocks up to the mouth of the cave, and post some men there to guard it.  "
"6084","Joshua","10","19","But don’t stop; pursue your enemies! Attack them from the rear and don’t let them reach their cities, for the  Lord  your God has given them into your hand.” "
"6085","Joshua","10","20","So Joshua and the Israelites defeated them completely, but a few survivors managed to reach their fortified cities.  "
"6086","Joshua","10","21","The whole army then returned safely to Joshua in the camp at Makkedah, and no one uttered a word against the Israelites. "
"6087","Joshua","10","22","Joshua said, “Open the mouth of the cave and bring those five kings out to me.”  "
"6088","Joshua","10","23","So they brought the five kings out of the cave—the kings of Jerusalem, Hebron, Jarmuth, Lachish and Eglon.  "
"6089","Joshua","10","24","When they had brought these kings to Joshua, he summoned all the men of Israel and said to the army commanders who had come with him, “Come here and put your feet on the necks of these kings.” So they came forward and placed their feet on their necks. "
"6090","Joshua","10","25","Joshua said to them, “Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged. Be strong and courageous. This is what the  Lord  will do to all the enemies you are going to fight.”  "
"6091","Joshua","10","26","Then Joshua put the kings to death and exposed their bodies on five poles, and they were left hanging on the poles until evening. "
"6092","Joshua","10","27","At sunset Joshua gave the order and they took them down from the poles and threw them into the cave where they had been hiding. At the mouth of the cave they placed large rocks, which are there to this day. "
"6093","Joshua","10","28","That day Joshua took Makkedah. He put the city and its king to the sword and totally destroyed everyone in it. He left no survivors. And he did to the king of Makkedah as he had done to the king of Jericho. "
"6094","Joshua","10","29","Then Joshua and all Israel with him moved on from Makkedah to Libnah and attacked it.  "
"6095","Joshua","10","30","The  Lord  also gave that city and its king into Israel’s hand. The city and everyone in it Joshua put to the sword. He left no survivors there. And he did to its king as he had done to the king of Jericho. "
"6096","Joshua","10","31","Then Joshua and all Israel with him moved on from Libnah to Lachish; he took up positions against it and attacked it.  "
"6097","Joshua","10","32","The  Lord  gave Lachish into Israel’s hands, and Joshua took it on the second day. The city and everyone in it he put to the sword, just as he had done to Libnah.  "
"6098","Joshua","10","33","Meanwhile, Horam king of Gezer had come up to help Lachish, but Joshua defeated him and his army—until no survivors were left. "
"6099","Joshua","10","34","Then Joshua and all Israel with him moved on from Lachish to Eglon; they took up positions against it and attacked it.  "
"6100","Joshua","10","35","They captured it that same day and put it to the sword and totally destroyed everyone in it, just as they had done to Lachish. "
"6101","Joshua","10","36","Then Joshua and all Israel with him went up from Eglon to Hebron and attacked it.  "
"6102","Joshua","10","37","They took the city and put it to the sword, together with its king, its villages and everyone in it. They left no survivors. Just as at Eglon, they totally destroyed it and everyone in it. "
"6103","Joshua","10","38","Then Joshua and all Israel with him turned around and attacked Debir.  "
"6104","Joshua","10","39","They took the city, its king and its villages, and put them to the sword. Everyone in it they totally destroyed. They left no survivors. They did to Debir and its king as they had done to Libnah and its king and to Hebron. "
"6105","Joshua","10","40","So Joshua subdued the whole region, including the hill country, the Negev, the western foothills and the mountain slopes, together with all their kings. He left no survivors. He totally destroyed all who breathed, just as the  Lord , the God of Israel, had commanded.  "
"6106","Joshua","10","41","Joshua subdued them from Kadesh Barnea to Gaza and from the whole region of Goshen to Gibeon.  "
"6107","Joshua","10","42","All these kings and their lands Joshua conquered in one campaign, because the  Lord , the God of Israel, fought for Israel. "
"6108","Joshua","10","43","Then Joshua returned with all Israel to the camp at Gilgal."
"6109","Joshua","11","1","When Jabin king of Hazor heard of this, he sent word to Jobab king of Madon, to the kings of Shimron and Akshaph,  "
"6110","Joshua","11","2","and to the northern kings who were in the mountains, in the Arabah south of Kinnereth, in the western foothills and in Naphoth Dor on the west;  "
"6111","Joshua","11","3","to the Canaanites in the east and west; to the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites and Jebusites in the hill country; and to the Hivites below Hermon in the region of Mizpah.  "
"6112","Joshua","11","4","They came out with all their troops and a large number of horses and chariots—a huge army, as numerous as the sand on the seashore.  "
"6113","Joshua","11","5","All these kings joined forces and made camp together at the Waters of Merom to fight against Israel. "
"6114","Joshua","11","6","The  Lord  said to Joshua, “Do not be afraid of them, because by this time tomorrow I will hand all of them, slain, over to Israel. You are to hamstring their horses and burn their chariots.” "
"6115","Joshua","11","7","So Joshua and his whole army came against them suddenly at the Waters of Merom and attacked them,  "
"6116","Joshua","11","8","and the  Lord  gave them into the hand of Israel. They defeated them and pursued them all the way to Greater Sidon, to Misrephoth Maim, and to the Valley of Mizpah on the east, until no survivors were left.  "
"6117","Joshua","11","9","Joshua did to them as the  Lord  had directed: He hamstrung their horses and burned their chariots. "
"6118","Joshua","11","10","At that time Joshua turned back and captured Hazor and put its king to the sword. (Hazor had been the head of all these kingdoms.)  "
"6119","Joshua","11","11","Everyone in it they put to the sword. They totally destroyed  them, not sparing anyone that breathed, and he burned Hazor itself. "
"6120","Joshua","11","12","Joshua took all these royal cities and their kings and put them to the sword. He totally destroyed them, as Moses the servant of the  Lord  had commanded.  "
"6121","Joshua","11","13","Yet Israel did not burn any of the cities built on their mounds—except Hazor, which Joshua burned.  "
"6122","Joshua","11","14","The Israelites carried off for themselves all the plunder and livestock of these cities, but all the people they put to the sword until they completely destroyed them, not sparing anyone that breathed.  "
"6123","Joshua","11","15","As the  Lord  commanded his servant Moses, so Moses commanded Joshua, and Joshua did it; he left nothing undone of all that the  Lord  commanded Moses. "
"6124","Joshua","11","16","So Joshua took this entire land: the hill country, all the Negev, the whole region of Goshen, the western foothills, the Arabah and the mountains of Israel with their foothills,  "
"6125","Joshua","11","17","from Mount Halak, which rises toward Seir, to Baal Gad in the Valley of Lebanon below Mount Hermon. He captured all their kings and put them to death.  "
"6126","Joshua","11","18","Joshua waged war against all these kings for a long time.  "
"6127","Joshua","11","19","Except for the Hivites living in Gibeon, not one city made a treaty of peace with the Israelites, who took them all in battle.  "
"6128","Joshua","11","20","For it was the  Lord  himself who hardened their hearts to wage war against Israel, so that he might destroy them totally, exterminating them without mercy, as the  Lord  had commanded Moses. "
"6129","Joshua","11","21","At that time Joshua went and destroyed the Anakites from the hill country: from Hebron, Debir and Anab, from all the hill country of Judah, and from all the hill country of Israel. Joshua totally destroyed them and their towns.  "
"6130","Joshua","11","22","No Anakites were left in Israelite territory; only in Gaza, Gath and Ashdod did any survive. "
"6131","Joshua","11","23","So Joshua took the entire land, just as the  Lord  had directed Moses, and he gave it as an inheritance to Israel according to their tribal divisions. Then the land had rest from war."
"6132","Joshua","12","1","These are the kings of the land whom the Israelites had defeated and whose territory they took over east of the Jordan, from the Arnon Gorge to Mount Hermon, including all the eastern side of the Arabah: "
"6133","Joshua","12","2","Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon. He ruled from Aroer on the rim of the Arnon Gorge—from the middle of the gorge—to the Jabbok River, which is the border of the Ammonites. This included half of Gilead.  "
"6134","Joshua","12","3","He also ruled over the eastern Arabah from the Sea of Galilee  to the Sea of the Arabah (that is, the Dead Sea), to Beth Jeshimoth, and then southward below the slopes of Pisgah. "
"6135","Joshua","12","4","And the territory of Og king of Bashan, one of the last of the Rephaites, who reigned in Ashtaroth and Edrei. "
"6136","Joshua","12","5","He ruled over Mount Hermon, Salekah, all of Bashan to the border of the people of Geshur and Maakah, and half of Gilead to the border of Sihon king of Heshbon. "
"6137","Joshua","12","6","Moses, the servant of the  Lord , and the Israelites conquered them. And Moses the servant of the  Lord  gave their land to the Reubenites, the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh to be their possession. "
"6138","Joshua","12","7","Here is a list of the kings of the land that Joshua and the Israelites conquered on the west side of the Jordan, from Baal Gad in the Valley of Lebanon to Mount Halak, which rises toward Seir. Joshua gave their lands as an inheritance to the tribes of Israel according to their tribal divisions.  "
"6139","Joshua","12","8","The lands included the hill country, the western foothills, the Arabah, the mountain slopes, the wilderness and the Negev. These were the lands of the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites. These were the kings: "
"6140","Joshua","12","9","the king of Jericho  one the king of Ai (near Bethel)  one "
"6141","Joshua","12","10","the king of Jerusalem  one the king of Hebron  one "
"6142","Joshua","12","11","the king of Jarmuth  one the king of Lachish  one "
"6143","Joshua","12","12","the king of Eglon  one the king of Gezer  one "
"6144","Joshua","12","13","the king of Debir  one the king of Geder  one "
"6145","Joshua","12","14","the king of Hormah  one the king of Arad  one "
"6146","Joshua","12","15","the king of Libnah  one the king of Adullam  one "
"6147","Joshua","12","16","the king of Makkedah  one the king of Bethel  one "
"6148","Joshua","12","17","the king of Tappuah  one the king of Hepher  one "
"6149","Joshua","12","18","the king of Aphek  one the king of Lasharon  one "
"6150","Joshua","12","19","the king of Madon  one the king of Hazor  one "
"6151","Joshua","12","20","the king of Shimron Meron  one the king of Akshaph  one "
"6152","Joshua","12","21","the king of Taanach  one the king of Megiddo  one "
"6153","Joshua","12","22","the king of Kedesh  one the king of Jokneam in Carmel  one "
"6154","Joshua","12","23","the king of Dor (in Naphoth Dor)  one the king of Goyim in Gilgal  one "
"6155","Joshua","12","24","the king of Tirzah  one thirty-one kings in all."
"6156","Joshua","13","1","When Joshua had grown old, the  Lord  said to him, “You are now very old, and there are still very large areas of land to be taken over. "
"6157","Joshua","13","2","“This is the land that remains: All the regions of the Philistines and Geshurites,  "
"6158","Joshua","13","3","from the Shihor River on the east of Egypt to the territory of Ekron on the north, all of it counted as Canaanite though held by the five Philistine rulers in Gaza, Ashdod, Ashkelon, Gath and Ekron; the territory of the Avvites  "
"6159","Joshua","13","4","on the south; all the land of the Canaanites, from Arah of the Sidonians as far as Aphek and the border of the Amorites;  "
"6160","Joshua","13","5","the area of Byblos; and all Lebanon to the east, from Baal Gad below Mount Hermon to Lebo Hamath. "
"6161","Joshua","13","6","“As for all the inhabitants of the mountain regions from Lebanon to Misrephoth Maim, that is, all the Sidonians, I myself will drive them out before the Israelites. Be sure to allocate this land to Israel for an inheritance, as I have instructed you,  "
"6162","Joshua","13","7","and divide it as an inheritance among the nine tribes and half of the tribe of Manasseh.” "
"6163","Joshua","13","8","The other half of Manasseh,  the Reubenites and the Gadites had received the inheritance that Moses had given them east of the Jordan, as he, the servant of the  Lord , had assigned it to them. "
"6164","Joshua","13","9","It extended from Aroer on the rim of the Arnon Gorge, and from the town in the middle of the gorge, and included the whole plateau of Medeba as far as Dibon,  "
"6165","Joshua","13","10","and all the towns of Sihon king of the Amorites, who ruled in Heshbon, out to the border of the Ammonites.  "
"6166","Joshua","13","11","It also included Gilead, the territory of the people of Geshur and Maakah, all of Mount Hermon and all Bashan as far as Salekah—  "
"6167","Joshua","13","12","that is, the whole kingdom of Og in Bashan, who had reigned in Ashtaroth and Edrei. (He was the last of the Rephaites.) Moses had defeated them and taken over their land.  "
"6168","Joshua","13","13","But the Israelites did not drive out the people of Geshur and Maakah, so they continue to live among the Israelites to this day. "
"6169","Joshua","13","14","But to the tribe of Levi he gave no inheritance, since the food offerings presented to the  Lord , the God of Israel, are their inheritance, as he promised them. "
"6170","Joshua","13","15","This is what Moses had given to the tribe of Reuben, according to its clans: "
"6171","Joshua","13","16","The territory from Aroer on the rim of the Arnon Gorge, and from the town in the middle of the gorge, and the whole plateau past Medeba  "
"6172","Joshua","13","17","to Heshbon and all its towns on the plateau, including Dibon, Bamoth Baal, Beth Baal Meon,  "
"6173","Joshua","13","18","Jahaz, Kedemoth, Mephaath,  "
"6174","Joshua","13","19","Kiriathaim, Sibmah, Zereth Shahar on the hill in the valley,  "
"6175","Joshua","13","20","Beth Peor, the slopes of Pisgah, and Beth Jeshimoth—  "
"6176","Joshua","13","21","all the towns on the plateau and the entire realm of Sihon king of the Amorites, who ruled at Heshbon. Moses had defeated him and the Midianite chiefs, Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur and Reba—princes allied with Sihon—who lived in that country.  "
"6177","Joshua","13","22","In addition to those slain in battle, the Israelites had put to the sword Balaam son of Beor, who practiced divination.  "
"6178","Joshua","13","23","The boundary of the Reubenites was the bank of the Jordan. These towns and their villages were the inheritance of the Reubenites, according to their clans. "
"6179","Joshua","13","24","This is what Moses had given to the tribe of Gad, according to its clans: "
"6180","Joshua","13","25","The territory of Jazer, all the towns of Gilead and half the Ammonite country as far as Aroer, near Rabbah;  "
"6181","Joshua","13","26","and from Heshbon to Ramath Mizpah and Betonim, and from Mahanaim to the territory of Debir;  "
"6182","Joshua","13","27","and in the valley, Beth Haram, Beth Nimrah, Sukkoth and Zaphon with the rest of the realm of Sihon king of Heshbon (the east side of the Jordan, the territory up to the end of the Sea of Galilee ).  "
"6183","Joshua","13","28","These towns and their villages were the inheritance of the Gadites, according to their clans. "
"6184","Joshua","13","29","This is what Moses had given to the half-tribe of Manasseh, that is, to half the family of the descendants of Manasseh, according to its clans: "
"6185","Joshua","13","30","The territory extending from Mahanaim and including all of Bashan, the entire realm of Og king of Bashan—all the settlements of Jair in Bashan, sixty towns,  "
"6186","Joshua","13","31","half of Gilead, and Ashtaroth and Edrei (the royal cities of Og in Bashan). This was for the descendants of Makir son of Manasseh—for half of the sons of Makir, according to their clans. "
"6187","Joshua","13","32","This is the inheritance Moses had given when he was in the plains of Moab across the Jordan east of Jericho.  "
"6188","Joshua","13","33","But to the tribe of Levi, Moses had given no inheritance; the  Lord , the God of Israel, is their inheritance, as he promised them."
"6189","Joshua","14","1","Now these are the areas the Israelites received as an inheritance in the land of Canaan, which Eleazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun and the heads of the tribal clans of Israel allotted to them.  "
"6190","Joshua","14","2","Their inheritances were assigned by lot to the nine-and-a-half tribes, as the  Lord  had commanded through Moses.  "
"6191","Joshua","14","3","Moses had granted the two-and-a-half tribes their inheritance east of the Jordan but had not granted the Levites an inheritance among the rest,  "
"6192","Joshua","14","4","for Joseph’s descendants had become two tribes—Manasseh and Ephraim. The Levites received no share of the land but only towns to live in, with pasturelands for their flocks and herds.  "
"6193","Joshua","14","5","So the Israelites divided the land, just as the  Lord  had commanded Moses. "
"6194","Joshua","14","6","Now the people of Judah approached Joshua at Gilgal, and Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite said to him, “You know what the  Lord  said to Moses the man of God at Kadesh Barnea about you and me.  "
"6195","Joshua","14","7","I was forty years old when Moses the servant of the  Lord  sent me from Kadesh Barnea to explore the land. And I brought him back a report according to my convictions,  "
"6196","Joshua","14","8","but my fellow Israelites who went up with me made the hearts of the people melt in fear. I, however, followed the  Lord  my God wholeheartedly.  "
"6197","Joshua","14","9","So on that day Moses swore to me, ‘The land on which your feet have walked will be your inheritance and that of your children forever, because you have followed the  Lord  my God wholeheartedly.’ "
"6198","Joshua","14","10","“Now then, just as the  Lord  promised, he has kept me alive for forty-five years since the time he said this to Moses, while Israel moved about in the wilderness. So here I am today, eighty-five years old!  "
"6199","Joshua","14","11","I am still as strong today as the day Moses sent me out; I’m just as vigorous to go out to battle now as I was then.  "
"6200","Joshua","14","12","Now give me this hill country that the  Lord  promised me that day. You yourself heard then that the Anakites were there and their cities were large and fortified, but, the  Lord  helping me, I will drive them out just as he said.” "
"6201","Joshua","14","13","Then Joshua blessed Caleb son of Jephunneh and gave him Hebron as his inheritance.  "
"6202","Joshua","14","14","So Hebron has belonged to Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite ever since, because he followed the  Lord , the God of Israel, wholeheartedly.  "
"6203","Joshua","14","15","(Hebron used to be called Kiriath Arba after Arba, who was the greatest man among the Anakites.) Then the land had rest from war."
"6204","Joshua","15","1","The allotment for the tribe of Judah, according to its clans, extended down to the territory of Edom, to the Desert of Zin in the extreme south."
"6205","Joshua","15","2","Their southern boundary started from the bay at the southern end of the Dead Sea, "
"6206","Joshua","15","3","crossed south of Scorpion Pass, continued on to Zin and went over to the south of Kadesh Barnea. Then it ran past Hezron up to Addar and curved around to Karka. "
"6207","Joshua","15","4","It then passed along to Azmon and joined the Wadi of Egypt, ending at the Mediterranean Sea. This is their southern boundary."
"6208","Joshua","15","5","The eastern boundary is the Dead Sea as far as the mouth of the Jordan.The northern boundary started from the bay of the sea at the mouth of the Jordan, "
"6209","Joshua","15","6","went up to Beth Hoglah and continued north of Beth Arabah to the Stone of Bohan son of Reuben. "
"6210","Joshua","15","7","The boundary then went up to Debir from the Valley of Achor and turned north to Gilgal, which faces the Pass of Adummim south of the gorge. It continued along to the waters of En Shemesh and came out at En Rogel. "
"6211","Joshua","15","8","Then it ran up the Valley of Ben Hinnom along the southern slope of the Jebusite city (that is, Jerusalem). From there it climbed to the top of the hill west of the Hinnom Valley at the northern end of the Valley of Rephaim. "
"6212","Joshua","15","9","From the hilltop the boundary headed toward the spring of the waters of Nephtoah, came out at the towns of Mount Ephron and went down toward Baalah (that is, Kiriath Jearim). "
"6213","Joshua","15","10","Then it curved westward from Baalah to Mount Seir, ran along the northern slope of Mount Jearim (that is, Kesalon), continued down to Beth Shemesh and crossed to Timnah. "
"6214","Joshua","15","11","It went to the northern slope of Ekron, turned toward Shikkeron, passed along to Mount Baalah and reached Jabneel. The boundary ended at the sea."
"6215","Joshua","15","12","The western boundary is the coastline of the Mediterranean Sea.These are the boundaries around the people of Judah by their clans."
"6216","Joshua","15","13","In accordance with the Lord’s command to him, Joshua gave to Caleb son of Jephunneh a portion in Judah—Kiriath Arba, that is, Hebron. (Arba was the forefather of Anak.) "
"6217","Joshua","15","14","From Hebron Caleb drove out the three Anakites—Sheshai, Ahiman and Talmai, the sons of Anak. "
"6218","Joshua","15","15","From there he marched against the people living in Debir (formerly called Kiriath Sepher). "
"6219","Joshua","15","16","And Caleb said, “I will give my daughter Aksah in marriage to the man who attacks and captures Kiriath Sepher.” "
"6220","Joshua","15","17","Othniel son of Kenaz, Caleb’s brother, took it; so Caleb gave his daughter Aksah to him in marriage."
"6221","Joshua","15","18","One day when she came to Othniel, she urged him to ask her father for a field. When she got off her donkey, Caleb asked her, “What can I do for you?”"
"6222","Joshua","15","19","She replied, “Do me a special favor. Since you have given me land in the Negev, give me also springs of water.” So Caleb gave her the upper and lower springs."
"6223","Joshua","15","20","This is the inheritance of the tribe of Judah, according to its clans:"
"6224","Joshua","15","21","The southernmost towns of the tribe of Judah in the Negev toward the boundary of Edom were:Kabzeel, Eder, Jagur, "

"6266","Joshua","15","63","Judah could not dislodge the Jebusites, who were living in Jerusalem; to this day the Jebusites live there with the people of Judah."
"6267","Joshua","16","1","The allotment for Joseph began at the Jordan, east of the springs of Jericho, and went up from there through the desert into the hill country of Bethel. "
"6268","Joshua","16","2","It went on from Bethel (that is, Luz),16:2 Septuagint; Hebrew Bethel to Luz crossed over to the territory of the Arkites in Ataroth, "
"6269","Joshua","16","3","descended westward to the territory of the Japhletites as far as the region of Lower Beth Horon and on to Gezer, ending at the Mediterranean Sea."
"6270","Joshua","16","4","So Manasseh and Ephraim, the descendants of Joseph, received their inheritance. "
"6271","Joshua","16","5","This was the territory of Ephraim, according to its clans: "
"6272","Joshua","16","6","and continued to the Mediterranean Sea. From Mikmethath on the north it curved eastward to Taanath Shiloh, passing by it to Janoah on the east. "
"6273","Joshua","16","7","Then it went down from Janoah to Ataroth and Naarah, touched Jericho and came out at the Jordan. "
"6274","Joshua","16","8","From Tappuah the border went west to the Kanah Ravine and ended at the Mediterranean Sea. This was the inheritance of the tribe of the Ephraimites, according to its clans. "
"6275","Joshua","16","9","It also included all the towns and their villages that were set aside for the Ephraimites within the inheritance of the Manassites."
"6276","Joshua","16","10","They did not dislodge the Canaanites living in Gezer; to this day the Canaanites live among the people of Ephraim but are required to do forced labor."
"6277","Joshua","17","1","This was the allotment for the tribe of Manasseh as Joseph’s firstborn, that is, for Makir, Manasseh’s firstborn. Makir was the ancestor of the Gileadites, who had received Gilead and Bashan because the Makirites were great soldiers.  "
"6278","Joshua","17","2","So this allotment was for the rest of the people of Manasseh—the clans of Abiezer, Helek, Asriel, Shechem, Hepher and Shemida. These are the other male descendants of Manasseh son of Joseph by their clans. "
"6279","Joshua","17","3","Now Zelophehad son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Makir, the son of Manasseh, had no sons but only daughters, whose names were Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milkah and Tirzah.  "
"6280","Joshua","17","4","They went to Eleazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun, and the leaders and said, “The  Lord  commanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our relatives.” So Joshua gave them an inheritance along with the brothers of their father, according to the  Lord ’s command.  "
"6281","Joshua","17","5","Manasseh’s share consisted of ten tracts of land besides Gilead and Bashan east of the Jordan,  "
"6282","Joshua","17","6","because the daughters of the tribe of Manasseh received an inheritance among the sons. The land of Gilead belonged to the rest of the descendants of Manasseh. "
"6283","Joshua","17","7","The territory of Manasseh extended from Asher to Mikmethath east of Shechem. The boundary ran southward from there to include the people living at En Tappuah. "
"6284","Joshua","17","8","(Manasseh had the land of Tappuah, but Tappuah itself, on the boundary of Manasseh, belonged to the Ephraimites.) "
"6285","Joshua","17","9","Then the boundary continued south to the Kanah Ravine. There were towns belonging to Ephraim lying among the towns of Manasseh, but the boundary of Manasseh was the northern side of the ravine and ended at the Mediterranean Sea. "
"6286","Joshua","17","10","On the south the land belonged to Ephraim, on the north to Manasseh. The territory of Manasseh reached the Mediterranean Sea and bordered Asher on the north and Issachar on the east."
"6287","Joshua","17","11","Within Issachar and Asher, Manasseh also had Beth Shan, Ibleam and the people of Dor, Endor, Taanach and Megiddo, together with their surrounding settlements (the third in the list is Naphoth17:11 That is, Naphoth Dor)."
"6288","Joshua","17","12","Yet the Manassites were not able to occupy these towns, for the Canaanites were determined to live in that region.  "
"6289","Joshua","17","13","However, when the Israelites grew stronger, they subjected the Canaanites to forced labor but did not drive them out completely. "
"6290","Joshua","17","14","The people of Joseph said to Joshua, “Why have you given us only one allotment and one portion for an inheritance? We are a numerous people, and the  Lord  has blessed us abundantly.” "
"6291","Joshua","17","15","“If you are so numerous,” Joshua answered, “and if the hill country of Ephraim is too small for you, go up into the forest and clear land for yourselves there in the land of the Perizzites and Rephaites.” "
"6292","Joshua","17","16","The people of Joseph replied, “The hill country is not enough for us, and all the Canaanites who live in the plain have chariots fitted with iron, both those in Beth Shan and its settlements and those in the Valley of Jezreel.” "
"6293","Joshua","17","17","But Joshua said to the tribes of Joseph—to Ephraim and Manasseh—“You are numerous and very powerful. You will have not only one allotment  "
"6294","Joshua","17","18","but the forested hill country as well. Clear it, and its farthest limits will be yours; though the Canaanites have chariots fitted with iron and though they are strong, you can drive them out.”"
"6295","Joshua","18","1","The whole assembly of the Israelites gathered at Shiloh and set up the tent of meeting there. The country was brought under their control,  "
"6296","Joshua","18","2","but there were still seven Israelite tribes who had not yet received their inheritance. "
"6297","Joshua","18","3","So Joshua said to the Israelites: “How long will you wait before you begin to take possession of the land that the  Lord , the God of your ancestors, has given you?  "
"6298","Joshua","18","4","Appoint three men from each tribe. I will send them out to make a survey of the land and to write a description of it, according to the inheritance of each. Then they will return to me.  "
"6299","Joshua","18","5","You are to divide the land into seven parts. Judah is to remain in its territory on the south and the tribes of Joseph in their territory on the north.  "
"6300","Joshua","18","6","After you have written descriptions of the seven parts of the land, bring them here to me and I will cast lots for you in the presence of the  Lord  our God.  "
"6301","Joshua","18","7","The Levites, however, do not get a portion among you, because the priestly service of the  Lord  is their inheritance. And Gad, Reuben and the half-tribe of Manasseh have already received their inheritance on the east side of the Jordan. Moses the servant of the  Lord  gave it to them.” "
"6302","Joshua","18","8","As the men started on their way to map out the land, Joshua instructed them, “Go and make a survey of the land and write a description of it. Then return to me, and I will cast lots for you here at Shiloh in the presence of the  Lord .”  "
"6303","Joshua","18","9","So the men left and went through the land. They wrote its description on a scroll, town by town, in seven parts, and returned to Joshua in the camp at Shiloh.  "
"6304","Joshua","18","10","Joshua then cast lots for them in Shiloh in the presence of the  Lord , and there he distributed the land to the Israelites according to their tribal divisions. "
"6305","Joshua","18","11","The first lot came up for the tribe of Benjamin according to its clans. Their allotted territory lay between the tribes of Judah and Joseph: "
"6306","Joshua","18","12","On the north side their boundary began at the Jordan, passed the northern slope of Jericho and headed west into the hill country, coming out at the wilderness of Beth Aven. "
"6307","Joshua","18","13","From there it crossed to the south slope of Luz (that is, Bethel) and went down to Ataroth Addar on the hill south of Lower Beth Horon."
"6308","Joshua","18","14","From the hill facing Beth Horon on the south the boundary turned south along the western side and came out at Kiriath Baal (that is, Kiriath Jearim), a town of the people of Judah. This was the western side."
"6309","Joshua","18","15","The southern side began at the outskirts of Kiriath Jearim on the west, and the boundary came out at the spring of the waters of Nephtoah. "
"6310","Joshua","18","16","The boundary went down to the foot of the hill facing the Valley of Ben Hinnom, north of the Valley of Rephaim. It continued down the Hinnom Valley along the southern slope of the Jebusite city and so to En Rogel. "
"6311","Joshua","18","17","It then curved north, went to En Shemesh, continued to Geliloth, which faces the Pass of Adummim, and ran down to the Stone of Bohan son of Reuben. "
"6312","Joshua","18","18","It continued to the northern slope of Beth Arabah18:18 Septuagint; Hebrew slope facing the Arabah and on down into the Arabah. "
"6313","Joshua","18","19","It then went to the northern slope of Beth Hoglah and came out at the northern bay of the Dead Sea, at the mouth of the Jordan in the south. This was the southern boundary."
"6314","Joshua","18","20","The Jordan formed the boundary on the eastern side.These were the boundaries that marked out the inheritance of the clans of Benjamin on all sides."
"6315","Joshua","18","21","The tribe of Benjamin, according to its clans, had the following towns:Jericho, Beth Hoglah, Emek Keziz, "
"6316","Joshua","18","22","Beth Arabah, Zemaraim, Bethel, "

"6321","Joshua","18","27","Rekem, Irpeel, Taralah, "

"6323","Joshua","19","1","The second lot came out for the tribe of Simeon according to its clans. Their inheritance lay within the territory of Judah.  "
"6324","Joshua","19","2","It included: "

"6330","Joshua","19","8","This was the inheritance of the tribe of the Simeonites, according to its clans.  "
"6331","Joshua","19","9","The inheritance of the Simeonites was taken from the share of Judah, because Judah’s portion was more than they needed. So the Simeonites received their inheritance within the territory of Judah. "
"6332","Joshua","19","10","The third lot came up for Zebulun according to its clans: "
"6333","Joshua","19","11","Going west it ran to Maralah, touched Dabbesheth, and extended to the ravine near Jokneam. "

"6335","Joshua","19","13","Then it continued eastward to Gath Hepher and Eth Kazin; it came out at Rimmon and turned toward Neah. "
"6336","Joshua","19","14","There the boundary went around on the north to Hannathon and ended at the Valley of Iphtah El. "

"6371","Joshua","19","49","When they had finished dividing the land into its allotted portions, the Israelites gave Joshua son of Nun an inheritance among them,  "
"6372","Joshua","19","50","as the  Lord  had commanded. They gave him the town he asked for—Timnath Serah  in the hill country of Ephraim. And he built up the town and settled there. "
"6373","Joshua","19","51","These are the territories that Eleazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun and the heads of the tribal clans of Israel assigned by lot at Shiloh in the presence of the  Lord  at the entrance to the tent of meeting. And so they finished dividing the land."
"6374","Joshua","20","1","Then the  Lord  said to Joshua:  "
"6375","Joshua","20","2","“Tell the Israelites to designate the cities of refuge, as I instructed you through Moses,  "
"6376","Joshua","20","3","so that anyone who kills a person accidentally and unintentionally may flee there and find protection from the avenger of blood.  "
"6377","Joshua","20","4","When they flee to one of these cities, they are to stand in the entrance of the city gate and state their case before the elders of that city. Then the elders are to admit the fugitive into their city and provide a place to live among them.  "
"6378","Joshua","20","5","If the avenger of blood comes in pursuit, the elders must not surrender the fugitive, because the fugitive killed their neighbor unintentionally and without malice aforethought.  "
"6379","Joshua","20","6","They are to stay in that city until they have stood trial before the assembly and until the death of the high priest who is serving at that time. Then they may go back to their own home in the town from which they fled.” "
"6380","Joshua","20","7","So they set apart Kedesh in Galilee in the hill country of Naphtali, Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim, and Kiriath Arba (that is, Hebron) in the hill country of Judah.  "
"6381","Joshua","20","8","East of the Jordan (on the other side from Jericho) they designated Bezer in the wilderness on the plateau in the tribe of Reuben, Ramoth in Gilead in the tribe of Gad, and Golan in Bashan in the tribe of Manasseh.  "
"6382","Joshua","20","9","Any of the Israelites or any foreigner residing among them who killed someone accidentally could flee to these designated cities and not be killed by the avenger of blood prior to standing trial before the assembly."
"6383","Joshua","21","1","Now the family heads of the Levites approached Eleazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun, and the heads of the other tribal families of Israel  "
"6384","Joshua","21","2","at Shiloh in Canaan and said to them, “The  Lord  commanded through Moses that you give us towns to live in, with pasturelands for our livestock.”  "
"6385","Joshua","21","3","So, as the  Lord  had commanded, the Israelites gave the Levites the following towns and pasturelands out of their own inheritance: "

"6392","Joshua","21","10","(these towns were assigned to the descendants of Aaron who were from the Kohathite clans of the Levites, because the first lot fell to them): "

"6424","Joshua","21","42","Each of these towns had pasturelands surrounding it; this was true for all these towns."

"6467","Joshua","23","6","“Be very strong; be careful to obey all that is written in the Book of the Law of Moses, without turning aside to the right or to the left.  "
"6468","Joshua","23","7","Do not associate with these nations that remain among you; do not invoke the names of their gods or swear by them. You must not serve them or bow down to them.  "
"6469","Joshua","23","8","But you are to hold fast to the  Lord  your God, as you have until now. "
"6470","Joshua","23","9","“The  Lord  has driven out before you great and powerful nations; to this day no one has been able to withstand you.  "
"6471","Joshua","23","10","One of you routs a thousand, because the  Lord  your God fights for you, just as he promised.  "
"6472","Joshua","23","11","So be very careful to love the  Lord  your God. "
"6473","Joshua","23","12","“But if you turn away and ally yourselves with the survivors of these nations that remain among you and if you intermarry with them and associate with them,  "
"6474","Joshua","23","13","then you may be sure that the  Lord  your God will no longer drive out these nations before you. Instead, they will become snares and traps for you, whips on your backs and thorns in your eyes, until you perish from this good land, which the  Lord  your God has given you. "
"6475","Joshua","23","14","“Now I am about to go the way of all the earth. You know with all your heart and soul that not one of all the good promises the  Lord  your God gave you has failed. Every promise has been fulfilled; not one has failed.  "
"6476","Joshua","23","15","But just as all the good things the  Lord  your God has promised you have come to you, so he will bring on you all the evil things he has threatened, until the  Lord  your God has destroyed you from this good land he has given you.  "
"6477","Joshua","23","16","If you violate the covenant of the  Lord  your God, which he commanded you, and go and serve other gods and bow down to them, the  Lord ’s anger will burn against you, and you will quickly perish from the good land he has given you.”"
"6478","Joshua","24","1","Then Joshua assembled all the tribes of Israel at Shechem. He summoned the elders, leaders, judges and officials of Israel, and they presented themselves before God. "
"6479","Joshua","24","2","Joshua said to all the people, “This is what the  Lord , the God of Israel, says: ‘Long ago your ancestors, including Terah the father of Abraham and Nahor, lived beyond the Euphrates River and worshiped other gods.  "
"6480","Joshua","24","3","But I took your father Abraham from the land beyond the Euphrates and led him throughout Canaan and gave him many descendants. I gave him Isaac,  "
"6481","Joshua","24","4","and to Isaac I gave Jacob and Esau. I assigned the hill country of Seir to Esau, but Jacob and his family went down to Egypt. "
"6482","Joshua","24","5","“ ‘Then I sent Moses and Aaron, and I afflicted the Egyptians by what I did there, and I brought you out.  "
"6483","Joshua","24","6","When I brought your people out of Egypt, you came to the sea, and the Egyptians pursued them with chariots and horsemen  as far as the Red Sea.   "
"6484","Joshua","24","7","But they cried to the  Lord  for help, and he put darkness between you and the Egyptians; he brought the sea over them and covered them. You saw with your own eyes what I did to the Egyptians. Then you lived in the wilderness for a long time. "
"6485","Joshua","24","8","“ ‘I brought you to the land of the Amorites who lived east of the Jordan. They fought against you, but I gave them into your hands. I destroyed them from before you, and you took possession of their land.  "
"6486","Joshua","24","9","When Balak son of Zippor, the king of Moab, prepared to fight against Israel, he sent for Balaam son of Beor to put a curse on you.  "
"6487","Joshua","24","10","But I would not listen to Balaam, so he blessed you again and again, and I delivered you out of his hand. "
"6488","Joshua","24","11","“ ‘Then you crossed the Jordan and came to Jericho. The citizens of Jericho fought against you, as did also the Amorites, Perizzites, Canaanites, Hittites, Girgashites, Hivites and Jebusites, but I gave them into your hands.  "
"6489","Joshua","24","12","I sent the hornet ahead of you, which drove them out before you—also the two Amorite kings. You did not do it with your own sword and bow.  "
"6490","Joshua","24","13","So I gave you a land on which you did not toil and cities you did not build; and you live in them and eat from vineyards and olive groves that you did not plant.’ "
"6491","Joshua","24","14","“Now fear the  Lord  and serve him with all faithfulness. Throw away the gods your ancestors worshiped beyond the Euphrates River and in Egypt, and serve the  Lord .  "
"6492","Joshua","24","15","But if serving the  Lord  seems undesirable to you, then choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve, whether the gods your ancestors served beyond the Euphrates, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you are living. But as for me and my household, we will serve the  Lord .” "
"6493","Joshua","24","16","Then the people answered, “Far be it from us to forsake the  Lord  to serve other gods!  "
"6494","Joshua","24","17","It was the  Lord  our God himself who brought us and our parents up out of Egypt, from that land of slavery, and performed those great signs before our eyes. He protected us on our entire journey and among all the nations through which we traveled.  "
"6495","Joshua","24","18","And the  Lord  drove out before us all the nations, including the Amorites, who lived in the land. We too will serve the  Lord , because he is our God.” "
"6496","Joshua","24","19","Joshua said to the people, “You are not able to serve the  Lord . He is a holy God; he is a jealous God. He will not forgive your rebellion and your sins.  "
"6497","Joshua","24","20","If you forsake the  Lord  and serve foreign gods, he will turn and bring disaster on you and make an end of you, after he has been good to you.” "
"6498","Joshua","24","21","But the people said to Joshua, “No! We will serve the  Lord .” "
"6499","Joshua","24","22","Then Joshua said, “You are witnesses against yourselves that you have chosen to serve the  Lord .” “Yes, we are witnesses,” they replied. "
"6500","Joshua","24","23","“Now then,” said Joshua, “throw away the foreign gods that are among you and yield your hearts to the  Lord , the God of Israel.” "
"6501","Joshua","24","24","And the people said to Joshua, “We will serve the  Lord  our God and obey him.” "
"6502","Joshua","24","25","On that day Joshua made a covenant for the people, and there at Shechem he reaffirmed for them decrees and laws.  "
"6503","Joshua","24","26","And Joshua recorded these things in the Book of the Law of God. Then he took a large stone and set it up there under the oak near the holy place of the  Lord . "
"6504","Joshua","24","27","“See!” he said to all the people. “This stone will be a witness against us. It has heard all the words the  Lord  has said to us. It will be a witness against you if you are untrue to your God.” "
"6505","Joshua","24","28","Then Joshua dismissed the people, each to their own inheritance. "
"6506","Joshua","24","29","After these things, Joshua son of Nun, the servant of the  Lord , died at the age of a hundred and ten.  "
"6507","Joshua","24","30","And they buried him in the land of his inheritance, at Timnath Serah  in the hill country of Ephraim, north of Mount Gaash. "
"6508","Joshua","24","31","Israel served the  Lord  throughout the lifetime of Joshua and of the elders who outlived him and who had experienced everything the  Lord  had done for Israel. "
"6509","Joshua","24","32","And Joseph’s bones, which the Israelites had brought up from Egypt, were buried at Shechem in the tract of land that Jacob bought for a hundred pieces of silver  from the sons of Hamor, the father of Shechem. This became the inheritance of Joseph’s descendants. "
"6510","Joshua","24","33","And Eleazar son of Aaron died and was buried at Gibeah, which had been allotted to his son Phinehas in the hill country of Ephraim."
"6511","Judges","1","1","After the death of Joshua, the Israelites asked the  Lord , “Who of us is to go up first to fight against the Canaanites?” "
"6512","Judges","1","2","The  Lord  answered, “Judah shall go up; I have given the land into their hands.” "
"6513","Judges","1","3","The men of Judah then said to the Simeonites their fellow Israelites, “Come up with us into the territory allotted to us, to fight against the Canaanites. We in turn will go with you into yours.” So the Simeonites went with them. "
"6514","Judges","1","4","When Judah attacked, the  Lord  gave the Canaanites and Perizzites into their hands, and they struck down ten thousand men at Bezek.  "
"6515","Judges","1","5","It was there that they found Adoni-Bezek and fought against him, putting to rout the Canaanites and Perizzites.  "
"6516","Judges","1","6","Adoni-Bezek fled, but they chased him and caught him, and cut off his thumbs and big toes. "
"6517","Judges","1","7","Then Adoni-Bezek said, “Seventy kings with their thumbs and big toes cut off have picked up scraps under my table. Now God has paid me back for what I did to them.” They brought him to Jerusalem, and he died there. "
"6518","Judges","1","8","The men of Judah attacked Jerusalem also and took it. They put the city to the sword and set it on fire. "
"6519","Judges","1","9","After that, Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites living in the hill country, the Negev and the western foothills.  "
"6520","Judges","1","10","They advanced against the Canaanites living in Hebron (formerly called Kiriath Arba) and defeated Sheshai, Ahiman and Talmai.  "
"6521","Judges","1","11","From there they advanced against the people living in Debir (formerly called Kiriath Sepher). "
"6522","Judges","1","12","And Caleb said, “I will give my daughter Aksah in marriage to the man who attacks and captures Kiriath Sepher.”  "
"6523","Judges","1","13","Othniel son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother, took it; so Caleb gave his daughter Aksah to him in marriage. "
"6524","Judges","1","14","One day when she came to Othniel, she urged him  to ask her father for a field. When she got off her donkey, Caleb asked her, “What can I do for you?” "
"6525","Judges","1","15","She replied, “Do me a special favor. Since you have given me land in the Negev, give me also springs of water.” So Caleb gave her the upper and lower springs. "
"6526","Judges","1","16","The descendants of Moses’ father-in-law, the Kenite, went up from the City of Palms  with the people of Judah to live among the inhabitants of the Desert of Judah in the Negev near Arad. "
"6527","Judges","1","17","Then the men of Judah went with the Simeonites their fellow Israelites and attacked the Canaanites living in Zephath, and they totally destroyed  the city. Therefore it was called Hormah.   "
"6528","Judges","1","18","Judah also took  Gaza, Ashkelon and Ekron—each city with its territory. "
"6529","Judges","1","19","The  Lord  was with the men of Judah. They took possession of the hill country, but they were unable to drive the people from the plains, because they had chariots fitted with iron.  "
"6530","Judges","1","20","As Moses had promised, Hebron was given to Caleb, who drove from it the three sons of Anak.  "
"6531","Judges","1","21","The Benjamites, however, did not drive out the Jebusites, who were living in Jerusalem; to this day the Jebusites live there with the Benjamites. "
"6532","Judges","1","22","Now the tribes of Joseph attacked Bethel, and the  Lord  was with them.  "
"6533","Judges","1","23","When they sent men to spy out Bethel (formerly called Luz),  "
"6534","Judges","1","24","the spies saw a man coming out of the city and they said to him, “Show us how to get into the city and we will see that you are treated well.”  "
"6535","Judges","1","25","So he showed them, and they put the city to the sword but spared the man and his whole family.  "
"6536","Judges","1","26","He then went to the land of the Hittites, where he built a city and called it Luz, which is its name to this day. "
"6537","Judges","1","27","But Manasseh did not drive out the people of Beth Shan or Taanach or Dor or Ibleam or Megiddo and their surrounding settlements, for the Canaanites were determined to live in that land.  "
"6538","Judges","1","28","When Israel became strong, they pressed the Canaanites into forced labor but never drove them out completely.  "
"6539","Judges","1","29","Nor did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites living in Gezer, but the Canaanites continued to live there among them.  "
"6540","Judges","1","30","Neither did Zebulun drive out the Canaanites living in Kitron or Nahalol, so these Canaanites lived among them, but Zebulun did subject them to forced labor.  "
"6541","Judges","1","31","Nor did Asher drive out those living in Akko or Sidon or Ahlab or Akzib or Helbah or Aphek or Rehob.  "
"6542","Judges","1","32","The Asherites lived among the Canaanite inhabitants of the land because they did not drive them out.  "
"6543","Judges","1","33","Neither did Naphtali drive out those living in Beth Shemesh or Beth Anath; but the Naphtalites too lived among the Canaanite inhabitants of the land, and those living in Beth Shemesh and Beth Anath became forced laborers for them.  "
"6544","Judges","1","34","The Amorites confined the Danites to the hill country, not allowing them to come down into the plain.  "
"6545","Judges","1","35","And the Amorites were determined also to hold out in Mount Heres, Aijalon and Shaalbim, but when the power of the tribes of Joseph increased, they too were pressed into forced labor.  "
"6546","Judges","1","36","The boundary of the Amorites was from Scorpion Pass to Sela and beyond."
"6547","Judges","2","1","The angel of the  Lord  went up from Gilgal to Bokim and said, “I brought you up out of Egypt and led you into the land I swore to give to your ancestors. I said, ‘I will never break my covenant with you,  "
"6548","Judges","2","2","and you shall not make a covenant with the people of this land, but you shall break down their altars.’ Yet you have disobeyed me. Why have you done this?  "
"6549","Judges","2","3","And I have also said, ‘I will not drive them out before you; they will become traps for you, and their gods will become snares to you.’ ” "
"6550","Judges","2","4","When the angel of the  Lord  had spoken these things to all the Israelites, the people wept aloud,  "
"6551","Judges","2","5","and they called that place Bokim.  There they offered sacrifices to the  Lord . "
"6552","Judges","2","6","After Joshua had dismissed the Israelites, they went to take possession of the land, each to their own inheritance.  "
"6553","Judges","2","7","The people served the  Lord  throughout the lifetime of Joshua and of the elders who outlived him and who had seen all the great things the  Lord  had done for Israel. "
"6554","Judges","2","8","Joshua son of Nun, the servant of the  Lord , died at the age of a hundred and ten.  "
"6555","Judges","2","9","And they buried him in the land of his inheritance, at Timnath Heres  in the hill country of Ephraim, north of Mount Gaash. "
"6556","Judges","2","10","After that whole generation had been gathered to their ancestors, another generation grew up who knew neither the  Lord  nor what he had done for Israel.  "
"6557","Judges","2","11","Then the Israelites did evil in the eyes of the  Lord  and served the Baals.  "
"6558","Judges","2","12","They forsook the  Lord , the God of their ancestors, who had brought them out of Egypt. They followed and worshiped various gods of the peoples around them. They aroused the  Lord ’s anger  "
"6559","Judges","2","13","because they forsook him and served Baal and the Ashtoreths.  "
"6560","Judges","2","14","In his anger against Israel the  Lord  gave them into the hands of raiders who plundered them. He sold them into the hands of their enemies all around, whom they were no longer able to resist.  "
"6561","Judges","2","15","Whenever Israel went out to fight, the hand of the  Lord  was against them to defeat them, just as he had sworn to them. They were in great distress. "
"6562","Judges","2","16","Then the  Lord  raised up judges,  who saved them out of the hands of these raiders.  "
"6563","Judges","2","17","Yet they would not listen to their judges but prostituted themselves to other gods and worshiped them. They quickly turned from the ways of their ancestors, who had been obedient to the  Lord ’s commands.  "
"6564","Judges","2","18","Whenever the  Lord  raised up a judge for them, he was with the judge and saved them out of the hands of their enemies as long as the judge lived; for the  Lord  relented because of their groaning under those who oppressed and afflicted them.  "
"6565","Judges","2","19","But when the judge died, the people returned to ways even more corrupt than those of their ancestors, following other gods and serving and worshiping them. They refused to give up their evil practices and stubborn ways. "
"6566","Judges","2","20","Therefore the  Lord  was very angry with Israel and said, “Because this nation has violated the covenant I ordained for their ancestors and has not listened to me,  "
"6567","Judges","2","21","I will no longer drive out before them any of the nations Joshua left when he died.  "
"6568","Judges","2","22","I will use them to test Israel and see whether they will keep the way of the  Lord  and walk in it as their ancestors did.”  "
"6569","Judges","2","23","The  Lord  had allowed those nations to remain; he did not drive them out at once by giving them into the hands of Joshua."
"6570","Judges","3","1","These are the nations the  Lord  left to test all those Israelites who had not experienced any of the wars in Canaan  "
"6571","Judges","3","2","(he did this only to teach warfare to the descendants of the Israelites who had not had previous battle experience):  "
"6572","Judges","3","3","the five rulers of the Philistines, all the Canaanites, the Sidonians, and the Hivites living in the Lebanon mountains from Mount Baal Hermon to Lebo Hamath.  "
"6573","Judges","3","4","They were left to test the Israelites to see whether they would obey the  Lord ’s commands, which he had given their ancestors through Moses. "
"6574","Judges","3","5","The Israelites lived among the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites.  "
"6575","Judges","3","6","They took their daughters in marriage and gave their own daughters to their sons, and served their gods. "
"6576","Judges","3","7","The Israelites did evil in the eyes of the  Lord ; they forgot the  Lord  their God and served the Baals and the Asherahs.  "
"6577","Judges","3","8","The anger of the  Lord  burned against Israel so that he sold them into the hands of Cushan-Rishathaim king of Aram Naharaim,  to whom the Israelites were subject for eight years.  "
"6578","Judges","3","9","But when they cried out to the  Lord , he raised up for them a deliverer, Othniel son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother, who saved them.  "
"6579","Judges","3","10","The Spirit of the  Lord  came on him, so that he became Israel’s judge  and went to war. The  Lord  gave Cushan-Rishathaim king of Aram into the hands of Othniel, who overpowered him.  "
"6580","Judges","3","11","So the land had peace for forty years, until Othniel son of Kenaz died. "
"6581","Judges","3","12","Again the Israelites did evil in the eyes of the  Lord , and because they did this evil the  Lord  gave Eglon king of Moab power over Israel.  "
"6582","Judges","3","13","Getting the Ammonites and Amalekites to join him, Eglon came and attacked Israel, and they took possession of the City of Palms.   "
"6583","Judges","3","14","The Israelites were subject to Eglon king of Moab for eighteen years. "
"6584","Judges","3","15","Again the Israelites cried out to the  Lord , and he gave them a deliverer—Ehud, a left-handed man, the son of Gera the Benjamite. The Israelites sent him with tribute to Eglon king of Moab.  "
"6585","Judges","3","16","Now Ehud had made a double-edged sword about a cubit  long, which he strapped to his right thigh under his clothing.  "
"6586","Judges","3","17","He presented the tribute to Eglon king of Moab, who was a very fat man.  "
"6587","Judges","3","18","After Ehud had presented the tribute, he sent on their way those who had carried it.  "
"6588","Judges","3","19","But on reaching the stone images near Gilgal he himself went back to Eglon and said, “Your Majesty, I have a secret message for you.” The king said to his attendants, “Leave us!” And they all left. "
"6589","Judges","3","20","Ehud then approached him while he was sitting alone in the upper room of his palace  and said, “I have a message from God for you.” As the king rose from his seat,  "
"6590","Judges","3","21","Ehud reached with his left hand, drew the sword from his right thigh and plunged it into the king’s belly.  "
"6591","Judges","3","22","Even the handle sank in after the blade, and his bowels discharged. Ehud did not pull the sword out, and the fat closed in over it.  "
"6592","Judges","3","23","Then Ehud went out to the porch ; he shut the doors of the upper room behind him and locked them. "
"6593","Judges","3","24","After he had gone, the servants came and found the doors of the upper room locked. They said, “He must be relieving himself in the inner room of the palace.”  "
"6594","Judges","3","25","They waited to the point of embarrassment, but when he did not open the doors of the room, they took a key and unlocked them. There they saw their lord fallen to the floor, dead. "
"6595","Judges","3","26","While they waited, Ehud got away. He passed by the stone images and escaped to Seirah.  "
"6596","Judges","3","27","When he arrived there, he blew a trumpet in the hill country of Ephraim, and the Israelites went down with him from the hills, with him leading them. "
"6597","Judges","3","28","“Follow me,” he ordered, “for the  Lord  has given Moab, your enemy, into your hands.” So they followed him down and took possession of the fords of the Jordan that led to Moab; they allowed no one to cross over.  "
"6598","Judges","3","29","At that time they struck down about ten thousand Moabites, all vigorous and strong; not one escaped.  "
"6599","Judges","3","30","That day Moab was made subject to Israel, and the land had peace for eighty years. "
"6600","Judges","3","31","After Ehud came Shamgar son of Anath, who struck down six hundred Philistines with an oxgoad. He too saved Israel."
"6601","Judges","4","1","Again the Israelites did evil in the eyes of the  Lord , now that Ehud was dead.  "
"6602","Judges","4","2","So the  Lord  sold them into the hands of Jabin king of Canaan, who reigned in Hazor. Sisera, the commander of his army, was based in Harosheth Haggoyim.  "
"6603","Judges","4","3","Because he had nine hundred chariots fitted with iron and had cruelly oppressed the Israelites for twenty years, they cried to the  Lord  for help. "
"6604","Judges","4","4","Now Deborah, a prophet, the wife of Lappidoth, was leading  Israel at that time.  "
"6605","Judges","4","5","She held court under the Palm of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim, and the Israelites went up to her to have their disputes decided.  "
"6606","Judges","4","6","She sent for Barak son of Abinoam from Kedesh in Naphtali and said to him, “The  Lord , the God of Israel, commands you: ‘Go, take with you ten thousand men of Naphtali and Zebulun and lead them up to Mount Tabor.  "
"6607","Judges","4","7","I will lead Sisera, the commander of Jabin’s army, with his chariots and his troops to the Kishon River and give him into your hands.’ ” "
"6608","Judges","4","8","Barak said to her, “If you go with me, I will go; but if you don’t go with me, I won’t go.” "
"6609","Judges","4","9","“Certainly I will go with you,” said Deborah. “But because of the course you are taking, the honor will not be yours, for the  Lord  will deliver Sisera into the hands of a woman.” So Deborah went with Barak to Kedesh.  "
"6610","Judges","4","10","There Barak summoned Zebulun and Naphtali, and ten thousand men went up under his command. Deborah also went up with him. "
"6611","Judges","4","11","Now Heber the Kenite had left the other Kenites, the descendants of Hobab, Moses’ brother-in-law,  and pitched his tent by the great tree in Zaanannim near Kedesh. "
"6612","Judges","4","12","When they told Sisera that Barak son of Abinoam had gone up to Mount Tabor,  "
"6613","Judges","4","13","Sisera summoned from Harosheth Haggoyim to the Kishon River all his men and his nine hundred chariots fitted with iron. "
"6614","Judges","4","14","Then Deborah said to Barak, “Go! This is the day the  Lord  has given Sisera into your hands. Has not the  Lord  gone ahead of you?” So Barak went down Mount Tabor, with ten thousand men following him.  "
"6615","Judges","4","15","At Barak’s advance, the  Lord  routed Sisera and all his chariots and army by the sword, and Sisera got down from his chariot and fled on foot. "
"6616","Judges","4","16","Barak pursued the chariots and army as far as Harosheth Haggoyim, and all Sisera’s troops fell by the sword; not a man was left.  "
"6617","Judges","4","17","Sisera, meanwhile, fled on foot to the tent of Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite, because there was an alliance between Jabin king of Hazor and the family of Heber the Kenite. "
"6618","Judges","4","18","Jael went out to meet Sisera and said to him, “Come, my lord, come right in. Don’t be afraid.” So he entered her tent, and she covered him with a blanket. "
"6619","Judges","4","19","“I’m thirsty,” he said. “Please give me some water.” She opened a skin of milk, gave him a drink, and covered him up. "
"6620","Judges","4","20","“Stand in the doorway of the tent,” he told her. “If someone comes by and asks you, ‘Is anyone in there?’ say ‘No.’ ” "
"6621","Judges","4","21","But Jael, Heber’s wife, picked up a tent peg and a hammer and went quietly to him while he lay fast asleep, exhausted. She drove the peg through his temple into the ground, and he died. "
"6622","Judges","4","22","Just then Barak came by in pursuit of Sisera, and Jael went out to meet him. “Come,” she said, “I will show you the man you’re looking for.” So he went in with her, and there lay Sisera with the tent peg through his temple—dead. "
"6623","Judges","4","23","On that day God subdued Jabin king of Canaan before the Israelites.  "
"6624","Judges","4","24","And the hand of the Israelites pressed harder and harder against Jabin king of Canaan until they destroyed him."
"6625","Judges","5","1","On that day Deborah and Barak son of Abinoam sang this song: "
"6626","Judges","5","2","“When the princes in Israel take the lead, when the people willingly offer themselves— praise the  Lord ! "
"6627","Judges","5","3","“Hear this, you kings! Listen, you rulers! I, even I, will sing to  the  Lord ; I will praise the  Lord , the God of Israel, in song. "
"6628","Judges","5","4","“When you,  Lord , went out from Seir, when you marched from the land of Edom, the earth shook, the heavens poured, the clouds poured down water. "
"6629","Judges","5","5","The mountains quaked before the  Lord , the One of Sinai, before the  Lord , the God of Israel. "
"6630","Judges","5","6","“In the days of Shamgar son of Anath, in the days of Jael, the highways were abandoned; travelers took to winding paths. "
"6631","Judges","5","7","Villagers in Israel would not fight; they held back until I, Deborah, arose, until I arose, a mother in Israel. "
"6632","Judges","5","8","God chose new leaders when war came to the city gates, but not a shield or spear was seen among forty thousand in Israel. "
"6633","Judges","5","9","My heart is with Israel’s princes, with the willing volunteers among the people. Praise the  Lord ! "
"6634","Judges","5","10","“You who ride on white donkeys, sitting on your saddle blankets, and you who walk along the road, consider  "
"6635","Judges","5","11","the voice of the singers  at the watering places. They recite the victories of the  Lord , the victories of his villagers in Israel. “Then the people of the  Lord went down to the city gates. "
"6636","Judges","5","12","‘Wake up, wake up, Deborah! Wake up, wake up, break out in song! Arise, Barak! Take captive your captives, son of Abinoam.’ "
"6637","Judges","5","13","“The remnant of the nobles came down; the people of the  Lord  came down to me against the mighty. "
"6638","Judges","5","14","Some came from Ephraim, whose roots were in Amalek; Benjamin was with the people who followed you. From Makir captains came down, from Zebulun those who bear a commander’s  staff. "
"6639","Judges","5","15","The princes of Issachar were with Deborah; yes, Issachar was with Barak, sent under his command into the valley. In the districts of Reuben there was much searching of heart. "
"6640","Judges","5","16","Why did you stay among the sheep pens to hear the whistling for the flocks? In the districts of Reuben there was much searching of heart. "
"6641","Judges","5","17","Gilead stayed beyond the Jordan. And Dan, why did he linger by the ships? Asher remained on the coast and stayed in his coves. "
"6642","Judges","5","18","The people of Zebulun risked their very lives; so did Naphtali on the terraced fields. "
"6643","Judges","5","19","“Kings came, they fought, the kings of Canaan fought. At Taanach, by the waters of Megiddo, they took no plunder of silver. "
"6644","Judges","5","20","From the heavens the stars fought, from their courses they fought against Sisera. "
"6645","Judges","5","21","The river Kishon swept them away, the age-old river, the river Kishon. March on, my soul; be strong! "
"6646","Judges","5","22","Then thundered the horses’ hooves— galloping, galloping go his mighty steeds. "
"6647","Judges","5","23","‘Curse Meroz,’ said the angel of the  Lord . ‘Curse its people bitterly, because they did not come to help the  Lord , to help the  Lord  against the mighty.’ "
"6648","Judges","5","24","“Most blessed of women be Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite, most blessed of tent-dwelling women. "
"6649","Judges","5","25","He asked for water, and she gave him milk; in a bowl fit for nobles she brought him curdled milk. "
"6650","Judges","5","26","Her hand reached for the tent peg, her right hand for the workman’s hammer. She struck Sisera, she crushed his head, she shattered and pierced his temple. "
"6651","Judges","5","27","At her feet he sank, he fell; there he lay. At her feet he sank, he fell; where he sank, there he fell—dead. "
"6652","Judges","5","28","“Through the window peered Sisera’s mother; behind the lattice she cried out, ‘Why is his chariot so long in coming? Why is the clatter of his chariots delayed?’ "
"6653","Judges","5","29","The wisest of her ladies answer her; indeed, she keeps saying to herself, "
"6654","Judges","5","30","‘Are they not finding and dividing the spoils: a woman or two for each man, colorful garments as plunder for Sisera, colorful garments embroidered, highly embroidered garments for my neck— all this as plunder?’ "
"6655","Judges","5","31","“So may all your enemies perish,  Lord ! But may all who love you be like the sun when it rises in its strength.” Then the land had peace forty years."
"6656","Judges","6","1","The Israelites did evil in the eyes of the  Lord , and for seven years he gave them into the hands of the Midianites.  "
"6657","Judges","6","2","Because the power of Midian was so oppressive, the Israelites prepared shelters for themselves in mountain clefts, caves and strongholds.  "
"6658","Judges","6","3","Whenever the Israelites planted their crops, the Midianites, Amalekites and other eastern peoples invaded the country.  "
"6659","Judges","6","4","They camped on the land and ruined the crops all the way to Gaza and did not spare a living thing for Israel, neither sheep nor cattle nor donkeys.  "
"6660","Judges","6","5","They came up with their livestock and their tents like swarms of locusts. It was impossible to count them or their camels; they invaded the land to ravage it.  "
"6661","Judges","6","6","Midian so impoverished the Israelites that they cried out to the  Lord  for help. "
"6662","Judges","6","7","When the Israelites cried out to the  Lord  because of Midian,  "
"6663","Judges","6","8","he sent them a prophet, who said, “This is what the  Lord , the God of Israel, says: I brought you up out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery.  "
"6664","Judges","6","9","I rescued you from the hand of the Egyptians. And I delivered you from the hand of all your oppressors; I drove them out before you and gave you their land.  "
"6665","Judges","6","10","I said to you, ‘I am the  Lord  your God; do not worship the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you live.’ But you have not listened to me.” "
"6666","Judges","6","11","The angel of the  Lord  came and sat down under the oak in Ophrah that belonged to Joash the Abiezrite, where his son Gideon was threshing wheat in a winepress to keep it from the Midianites.  "
"6667","Judges","6","12","When the angel of the  Lord  appeared to Gideon, he said, “The  Lord  is with you, mighty warrior.” "
"6668","Judges","6","13","“Pardon me, my lord,” Gideon replied, “but if the  Lord  is with us, why has all this happened to us? Where are all his wonders that our ancestors told us about when they said, ‘Did not the  Lord  bring us up out of Egypt?’ But now the  Lord  has abandoned us and given us into the hand of Midian.” "
"6669","Judges","6","14","The  Lord  turned to him and said, “Go in the strength you have and save Israel out of Midian’s hand. Am I not sending you?” "
"6670","Judges","6","15","“Pardon me, my lord,” Gideon replied, “but how can I save Israel? My clan is the weakest in Manasseh, and I am the least in my family.” "
"6671","Judges","6","16","The  Lord  answered, “I will be with you, and you will strike down all the Midianites, leaving none alive.” "
"6672","Judges","6","17","Gideon replied, “If now I have found favor in your eyes, give me a sign that it is really you talking to me.  "
"6673","Judges","6","18","Please do not go away until I come back and bring my offering and set it before you.” And the  Lord  said, “I will wait until you return.” "
"6674","Judges","6","19","Gideon went inside, prepared a young goat, and from an ephah  of flour he made bread without yeast. Putting the meat in a basket and its broth in a pot, he brought them out and offered them to him under the oak. "
"6675","Judges","6","20","The angel of God said to him, “Take the meat and the unleavened bread, place them on this rock, and pour out the broth.” And Gideon did so.  "
"6676","Judges","6","21","Then the angel of the  Lord  touched the meat and the unleavened bread with the tip of the staff that was in his hand. Fire flared from the rock, consuming the meat and the bread. And the angel of the  Lord  disappeared.  "
"6677","Judges","6","22","When Gideon realized that it was the angel of the  Lord , he exclaimed, “Alas, Sovereign  Lord ! I have seen the angel of the  Lord  face to face!” "
"6678","Judges","6","23","But the  Lord  said to him, “Peace! Do not be afraid. You are not going to die.” "
"6679","Judges","6","24","So Gideon built an altar to the  Lord  there and called it The  Lord  Is Peace. To this day it stands in Ophrah of the Abiezrites. "
"6680","Judges","6","25","That same night the  Lord  said to him, “Take the second bull from your father’s herd, the one seven years old.  Tear down your father’s altar to Baal and cut down the Asherah pole  beside it.  "
"6681","Judges","6","26","Then build a proper kind of  altar to the  Lord  your God on the top of this height. Using the wood of the Asherah pole that you cut down, offer the second  bull as a burnt offering.” "
"6682","Judges","6","27","So Gideon took ten of his servants and did as the  Lord  told him. But because he was afraid of his family and the townspeople, he did it at night rather than in the daytime. "
"6683","Judges","6","28","In the morning when the people of the town got up, there was Baal’s altar, demolished, with the Asherah pole beside it cut down and the second bull sacrificed on the newly built altar! "
"6684","Judges","6","29","They asked each other, “Who did this?” When they carefully investigated, they were told, “Gideon son of Joash did it.” "
"6685","Judges","6","30","The people of the town demanded of Joash, “Bring out your son. He must die, because he has broken down Baal’s altar and cut down the Asherah pole beside it.” "
"6686","Judges","6","31","But Joash replied to the hostile crowd around him, “Are you going to plead Baal’s cause? Are you trying to save him? Whoever fights for him shall be put to death by morning! If Baal really is a god, he can defend himself when someone breaks down his altar.”  "
"6687","Judges","6","32","So because Gideon broke down Baal’s altar, they gave him the name Jerub-Baal  that day, saying, “Let Baal contend with him.” "
"6688","Judges","6","33","Now all the Midianites, Amalekites and other eastern peoples joined forces and crossed over the Jordan and camped in the Valley of Jezreel.  "
"6689","Judges","6","34","Then the Spirit of the  Lord  came on Gideon, and he blew a trumpet, summoning the Abiezrites to follow him.  "
"6690","Judges","6","35","He sent messengers throughout Manasseh, calling them to arms, and also into Asher, Zebulun and Naphtali, so that they too went up to meet them. "
"6691","Judges","6","36","Gideon said to God, “If you will save Israel by my hand as you have promised—  "
"6692","Judges","6","37","look, I will place a wool fleece on the threshing floor. If there is dew only on the fleece and all the ground is dry, then I will know that you will save Israel by my hand, as you said.”  "
"6693","Judges","6","38","And that is what happened. Gideon rose early the next day; he squeezed the fleece and wrung out the dew—a bowlful of water. "
"6694","Judges","6","39","Then Gideon said to God, “Do not be angry with me. Let me make just one more request. Allow me one more test with the fleece, but this time make the fleece dry and let the ground be covered with dew.”  "
"6695","Judges","6","40","That night God did so. Only the fleece was dry; all the ground was covered with dew."
"6696","Judges","7","1","Early in the morning, Jerub-Baal (that is, Gideon) and all his men camped at the spring of Harod. The camp of Midian was north of them in the valley near the hill of Moreh.  "
"6697","Judges","7","2","The  Lord  said to Gideon, “You have too many men. I cannot deliver Midian into their hands, or Israel would boast against me, ‘My own strength has saved me.’  "
"6698","Judges","7","3","Now announce to the army, ‘Anyone who trembles with fear may turn back and leave Mount Gilead.’ ” So twenty-two thousand men left, while ten thousand remained. "
"6699","Judges","7","4","But the  Lord  said to Gideon, “There are still too many men. Take them down to the water, and I will thin them out for you there. If I say, ‘This one shall go with you,’ he shall go; but if I say, ‘This one shall not go with you,’ he shall not go.” "
"6700","Judges","7","5","So Gideon took the men down to the water. There the  Lord  told him, “Separate those who lap the water with their tongues as a dog laps from those who kneel down to drink.”  "
"6701","Judges","7","6","Three hundred of them drank from cupped hands, lapping like dogs. All the rest got down on their knees to drink. "
"6702","Judges","7","7","The  Lord  said to Gideon, “With the three hundred men that lapped I will save you and give the Midianites into your hands. Let all the others go home.”  "
"6703","Judges","7","8","So Gideon sent the rest of the Israelites home but kept the three hundred, who took over the provisions and trumpets of the others. Now the camp of Midian lay below him in the valley.  "
"6704","Judges","7","9","During that night the  Lord  said to Gideon, “Get up, go down against the camp, because I am going to give it into your hands.  "
"6705","Judges","7","10","If you are afraid to attack, go down to the camp with your servant Purah  "
"6706","Judges","7","11","and listen to what they are saying. Afterward, you will be encouraged to attack the camp.” So he and Purah his servant went down to the outposts of the camp.  "
"6707","Judges","7","12","The Midianites, the Amalekites and all the other eastern peoples had settled in the valley, thick as locusts. Their camels could no more be counted than the sand on the seashore. "
"6708","Judges","7","13","Gideon arrived just as a man was telling a friend his dream. “I had a dream,” he was saying. “A round loaf of barley bread came tumbling into the Midianite camp. It struck the tent with such force that the tent overturned and collapsed.” "
"6709","Judges","7","14","His friend responded, “This can be nothing other than the sword of Gideon son of Joash, the Israelite. God has given the Midianites and the whole camp into his hands.” "
"6710","Judges","7","15","When Gideon heard the dream and its interpretation, he bowed down and worshiped. He returned to the camp of Israel and called out, “Get up! The  Lord  has given the Midianite camp into your hands.”  "
"6711","Judges","7","16","Dividing the three hundred men into three companies, he placed trumpets and empty jars in the hands of all of them, with torches inside. "
"6712","Judges","7","17","“Watch me,” he told them. “Follow my lead. When I get to the edge of the camp, do exactly as I do.  "
"6713","Judges","7","18","When I and all who are with me blow our trumpets, then from all around the camp blow yours and shout, ‘For the  Lord  and for Gideon.’ ” "
"6714","Judges","7","19","Gideon and the hundred men with him reached the edge of the camp at the beginning of the middle watch, just after they had changed the guard. They blew their trumpets and broke the jars that were in their hands.  "
"6715","Judges","7","20","The three companies blew the trumpets and smashed the jars. Grasping the torches in their left hands and holding in their right hands the trumpets they were to blow, they shouted, “A sword for the  Lord  and for Gideon!”  "
"6716","Judges","7","21","While each man held his position around the camp, all the Midianites ran, crying out as they fled. "
"6717","Judges","7","22","When the three hundred trumpets sounded, the  Lord  caused the men throughout the camp to turn on each other with their swords. The army fled to Beth Shittah toward Zererah as far as the border of Abel Meholah near Tabbath.  "
"6718","Judges","7","23","Israelites from Naphtali, Asher and all Manasseh were called out, and they pursued the Midianites.  "
"6719","Judges","7","24","Gideon sent messengers throughout the hill country of Ephraim, saying, “Come down against the Midianites and seize the waters of the Jordan ahead of them as far as Beth Barah.” So all the men of Ephraim were called out and they seized the waters of the Jordan as far as Beth Barah.  "
"6720","Judges","7","25","They also captured two of the Midianite leaders, Oreb and Zeeb. They killed Oreb at the rock of Oreb, and Zeeb at the winepress of Zeeb. They pursued the Midianites and brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon, who was by the Jordan."
"6721","Judges","8","1","Now the Ephraimites asked Gideon, “Why have you treated us like this? Why didn’t you call us when you went to fight Midian?” And they challenged him vigorously. "
"6722","Judges","8","2","But he answered them, “What have I accomplished compared to you? Aren’t the gleanings of Ephraim’s grapes better than the full grape harvest of Abiezer?  "
"6723","Judges","8","3","God gave Oreb and Zeeb, the Midianite leaders, into your hands. What was I able to do compared to you?” At this, their resentment against him subsided. "
"6724","Judges","8","4","Gideon and his three hundred men, exhausted yet keeping up the pursuit, came to the Jordan and crossed it.  "
"6725","Judges","8","5","He said to the men of Sukkoth, “Give my troops some bread; they are worn out, and I am still pursuing Zebah and Zalmunna, the kings of Midian.” "
"6726","Judges","8","6","But the officials of Sukkoth said, “Do you already have the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna in your possession? Why should we give bread to your troops?” "
"6727","Judges","8","7","Then Gideon replied, “Just for that, when the  Lord  has given Zebah and Zalmunna into my hand, I will tear your flesh with desert thorns and briers.” "
"6728","Judges","8","8","From there he went up to Peniel  and made the same request of them, but they answered as the men of Sukkoth had.  "
"6729","Judges","8","9","So he said to the men of Peniel, “When I return in triumph, I will tear down this tower.” "
"6730","Judges","8","10","Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor with a force of about fifteen thousand men, all that were left of the armies of the eastern peoples; a hundred and twenty thousand swordsmen had fallen.  "
"6731","Judges","8","11","Gideon went up by the route of the nomads east of Nobah and Jogbehah and attacked the unsuspecting army.  "
"6732","Judges","8","12","Zebah and Zalmunna, the two kings of Midian, fled, but he pursued them and captured them, routing their entire army. "
"6733","Judges","8","13","Gideon son of Joash then returned from the battle by the Pass of Heres.  "
"6734","Judges","8","14","He caught a young man of Sukkoth and questioned him, and the young man wrote down for him the names of the seventy-seven officials of Sukkoth, the elders of the town.  "
"6735","Judges","8","15","Then Gideon came and said to the men of Sukkoth, “Here are Zebah and Zalmunna, about whom you taunted me by saying, ‘Do you already have the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna in your possession? Why should we give bread to your exhausted men?’ ”  "
"6736","Judges","8","16","He took the elders of the town and taught the men of Sukkoth a lesson by punishing them with desert thorns and briers.  "
"6737","Judges","8","17","He also pulled down the tower of Peniel and killed the men of the town. "
"6738","Judges","8","18","Then he asked Zebah and Zalmunna, “What kind of men did you kill at Tabor?” “Men like you,” they answered, “each one with the bearing of a prince.” "
"6739","Judges","8","19","Gideon replied, “Those were my brothers, the sons of my own mother. As surely as the  Lord  lives, if you had spared their lives, I would not kill you.”  "
"6740","Judges","8","20","Turning to Jether, his oldest son, he said, “Kill them!” But Jether did not draw his sword, because he was only a boy and was afraid. "
"6741","Judges","8","21","Zebah and Zalmunna said, “Come, do it yourself. ‘As is the man, so is his strength.’ ” So Gideon stepped forward and killed them, and took the ornaments off their camels’ necks. "
"6742","Judges","8","22","The Israelites said to Gideon, “Rule over us—you, your son and your grandson—because you have saved us from the hand of Midian.” "
"6743","Judges","8","23","But Gideon told them, “I will not rule over you, nor will my son rule over you. The  Lord  will rule over you.”  "
"6744","Judges","8","24","And he said, “I do have one request, that each of you give me an earring from your share of the plunder.” (It was the custom of the Ishmaelites to wear gold earrings.) "
"6745","Judges","8","25","They answered, “We’ll be glad to give them.” So they spread out a garment, and each of them threw a ring from his plunder onto it.  "
"6746","Judges","8","26","The weight of the gold rings he asked for came to seventeen hundred shekels,  not counting the ornaments, the pendants and the purple garments worn by the kings of Midian or the chains that were on their camels’ necks.  "
"6747","Judges","8","27","Gideon made the gold into an ephod, which he placed in Ophrah, his town. All Israel prostituted themselves by worshiping it there, and it became a snare to Gideon and his family. "
"6748","Judges","8","28","Thus Midian was subdued before the Israelites and did not raise its head again. During Gideon’s lifetime, the land had peace forty years. "
"6749","Judges","8","29","Jerub-Baal son of Joash went back home to live.  "
"6750","Judges","8","30","He had seventy sons of his own, for he had many wives.  "
"6751","Judges","8","31","His concubine, who lived in Shechem, also bore him a son, whom he named Abimelek.  "
"6752","Judges","8","32","Gideon son of Joash died at a good old age and was buried in the tomb of his father Joash in Ophrah of the Abiezrites. "
"6753","Judges","8","33","No sooner had Gideon died than the Israelites again prostituted themselves to the Baals. They set up Baal-Berith as their god  "
"6754","Judges","8","34","and did not remember the  Lord  their God, who had rescued them from the hands of all their enemies on every side.  "
"6755","Judges","8","35","They also failed to show any loyalty to the family of Jerub-Baal (that is, Gideon) in spite of all the good things he had done for them."
"6756","Judges","9","1","Abimelek son of Jerub-Baal went to his mother’s brothers in Shechem and said to them and to all his mother’s clan,  "
"6757","Judges","9","2","“Ask all the citizens of Shechem, ‘Which is better for you: to have all seventy of Jerub-Baal’s sons rule over you, or just one man?’ Remember, I am your flesh and blood.” "
"6758","Judges","9","3","When the brothers repeated all this to the citizens of Shechem, they were inclined to follow Abimelek, for they said, “He is related to us.”  "
"6759","Judges","9","4","They gave him seventy shekels  of silver from the temple of Baal-Berith, and Abimelek used it to hire reckless scoundrels, who became his followers.  "
"6760","Judges","9","5","He went to his father’s home in Ophrah and on one stone murdered his seventy brothers, the sons of Jerub-Baal. But Jotham, the youngest son of Jerub-Baal, escaped by hiding.  "
"6761","Judges","9","6","Then all the citizens of Shechem and Beth Millo gathered beside the great tree at the pillar in Shechem to crown Abimelek king. "
"6762","Judges","9","7","When Jotham was told about this, he climbed up on the top of Mount Gerizim and shouted to them, “Listen to me, citizens of Shechem, so that God may listen to you.  "
"6763","Judges","9","8","One day the trees went out to anoint a king for themselves. They said to the olive tree, ‘Be our king.’ "
"6764","Judges","9","9","“But the olive tree answered, ‘Should I give up my oil, by which both gods and humans are honored, to hold sway over the trees?’ "
"6765","Judges","9","10","“Next, the trees said to the fig tree, ‘Come and be our king.’ "
"6766","Judges","9","11","“But the fig tree replied, ‘Should I give up my fruit, so good and sweet, to hold sway over the trees?’ "
"6767","Judges","9","12","“Then the trees said to the vine, ‘Come and be our king.’ "
"6768","Judges","9","13","“But the vine answered, ‘Should I give up my wine, which cheers both gods and humans, to hold sway over the trees?’ "
"6769","Judges","9","14","“Finally all the trees said to the thornbush, ‘Come and be our king.’ "
"6770","Judges","9","15","“The thornbush said to the trees, ‘If you really want to anoint me king over you, come and take refuge in my shade; but if not, then let fire come out of the thornbush and consume the cedars of Lebanon!’ "
"6771","Judges","9","16","“Have you acted honorably and in good faith by making Abimelek king? Have you been fair to Jerub-Baal and his family? Have you treated him as he deserves?  "
"6772","Judges","9","17","Remember that my father fought for you and risked his life to rescue you from the hand of Midian.  "
"6773","Judges","9","18","But today you have revolted against my father’s family. You have murdered his seventy sons on a single stone and have made Abimelek, the son of his female slave, king over the citizens of Shechem because he is related to you.  "
"6774","Judges","9","19","So have you acted honorably and in good faith toward Jerub-Baal and his family today? If you have, may Abimelek be your joy, and may you be his, too!  "
"6775","Judges","9","20","But if you have not, let fire come out from Abimelek and consume you, the citizens of Shechem and Beth Millo, and let fire come out from you, the citizens of Shechem and Beth Millo, and consume Abimelek!” "
"6776","Judges","9","21","Then Jotham fled, escaping to Beer, and he lived there because he was afraid of his brother Abimelek. "
"6777","Judges","9","22","After Abimelek had governed Israel three years,  "
"6778","Judges","9","23","God stirred up animosity between Abimelek and the citizens of Shechem so that they acted treacherously against Abimelek.  "
"6779","Judges","9","24","God did this in order that the crime against Jerub-Baal’s seventy sons, the shedding of their blood, might be avenged on their brother Abimelek and on the citizens of Shechem, who had helped him murder his brothers.  "
"6780","Judges","9","25","In opposition to him these citizens of Shechem set men on the hilltops to ambush and rob everyone who passed by, and this was reported to Abimelek. "
"6781","Judges","9","26","Now Gaal son of Ebed moved with his clan into Shechem, and its citizens put their confidence in him.  "
"6782","Judges","9","27","After they had gone out into the fields and gathered the grapes and trodden them, they held a festival in the temple of their god. While they were eating and drinking, they cursed Abimelek.  "
"6783","Judges","9","28","Then Gaal son of Ebed said, “Who is Abimelek, and why should we Shechemites be subject to him? Isn’t he Jerub-Baal’s son, and isn’t Zebul his deputy? Serve the family of Hamor, Shechem’s father! Why should we serve Abimelek?  "
"6784","Judges","9","29","If only this people were under my command! Then I would get rid of him. I would say to Abimelek, ‘Call out your whole army!’ ” "
"6785","Judges","9","30","When Zebul the governor of the city heard what Gaal son of Ebed said, he was very angry.  "
"6786","Judges","9","31","Under cover he sent messengers to Abimelek, saying, “Gaal son of Ebed and his clan have come to Shechem and are stirring up the city against you.  "
"6787","Judges","9","32","Now then, during the night you and your men should come and lie in wait in the fields.  "
"6788","Judges","9","33","In the morning at sunrise, advance against the city. When Gaal and his men come out against you, seize the opportunity to attack them.” "
"6789","Judges","9","34","So Abimelek and all his troops set out by night and took up concealed positions near Shechem in four companies.  "
"6790","Judges","9","35","Now Gaal son of Ebed had gone out and was standing at the entrance of the city gate just as Abimelek and his troops came out from their hiding place. "
"6791","Judges","9","36","When Gaal saw them, he said to Zebul, “Look, people are coming down from the tops of the mountains!” Zebul replied, “You mistake the shadows of the mountains for men.” "
"6792","Judges","9","37","But Gaal spoke up again: “Look, people are coming down from the central hill,  and a company is coming from the direction of the diviners’ tree.” "
"6793","Judges","9","38","Then Zebul said to him, “Where is your big talk now, you who said, ‘Who is Abimelek that we should be subject to him?’ Aren’t these the men you ridiculed? Go out and fight them!” "
"6794","Judges","9","39","So Gaal led out  the citizens of Shechem and fought Abimelek.  "
"6795","Judges","9","40","Abimelek chased him all the way to the entrance of the gate, and many were killed as they fled.  "
"6796","Judges","9","41","Then Abimelek stayed in Arumah, and Zebul drove Gaal and his clan out of Shechem. "
"6797","Judges","9","42","The next day the people of Shechem went out to the fields, and this was reported to Abimelek.  "
"6798","Judges","9","43","So he took his men, divided them into three companies and set an ambush in the fields. When he saw the people coming out of the city, he rose to attack them.  "
"6799","Judges","9","44","Abimelek and the companies with him rushed forward to a position at the entrance of the city gate. Then two companies attacked those in the fields and struck them down.  "
"6800","Judges","9","45","All that day Abimelek pressed his attack against the city until he had captured it and killed its people. Then he destroyed the city and scattered salt over it. "
"6801","Judges","9","46","On hearing this, the citizens in the tower of Shechem went into the stronghold of the temple of El-Berith.  "
"6802","Judges","9","47","When Abimelek heard that they had assembled there,  "
"6803","Judges","9","48","he and all his men went up Mount Zalmon. He took an ax and cut off some branches, which he lifted to his shoulders. He ordered the men with him, “Quick! Do what you have seen me do!”  "
"6804","Judges","9","49","So all the men cut branches and followed Abimelek. They piled them against the stronghold and set it on fire with the people still inside. So all the people in the tower of Shechem, about a thousand men and women, also died. "
"6805","Judges","9","50","Next Abimelek went to Thebez and besieged it and captured it.  "
"6806","Judges","9","51","Inside the city, however, was a strong tower, to which all the men and women—all the people of the city—had fled. They had locked themselves in and climbed up on the tower roof.  "
"6807","Judges","9","52","Abimelek went to the tower and attacked it. But as he approached the entrance to the tower to set it on fire,  "
"6808","Judges","9","53","a woman dropped an upper millstone on his head and cracked his skull. "
"6809","Judges","9","54","Hurriedly he called to his armor-bearer, “Draw your sword and kill me, so that they can’t say, ‘A woman killed him.’ ” So his servant ran him through, and he died.  "
"6810","Judges","9","55","When the Israelites saw that Abimelek was dead, they went home. "
"6811","Judges","9","56","Thus God repaid the wickedness that Abimelek had done to his father by murdering his seventy brothers.  "
"6812","Judges","9","57","God also made the people of Shechem pay for all their wickedness. The curse of Jotham son of Jerub-Baal came on them."
"6813","Judges","10","1","After the time of Abimelek, a man of Issachar named Tola son of Puah, the son of Dodo, rose to save Israel. He lived in Shamir, in the hill country of Ephraim.  "
"6814","Judges","10","2","He led  Israel twenty-three years; then he died, and was buried in Shamir. "
"6815","Judges","10","3","He was followed by Jair of Gilead, who led Israel twenty-two years.  "
"6816","Judges","10","4","He had thirty sons, who rode thirty donkeys. They controlled thirty towns in Gilead, which to this day are called Havvoth Jair.   "
"6817","Judges","10","5","When Jair died, he was buried in Kamon. "
"6818","Judges","10","6","Again the Israelites did evil in the eyes of the  Lord . They served the Baals and the Ashtoreths, and the gods of Aram, the gods of Sidon, the gods of Moab, the gods of the Ammonites and the gods of the Philistines. And because the Israelites forsook the  Lord  and no longer served him,  "
"6819","Judges","10","7","he became angry with them. He sold them into the hands of the Philistines and the Ammonites,  "
"6820","Judges","10","8","who that year shattered and crushed them. For eighteen years they oppressed all the Israelites on the east side of the Jordan in Gilead, the land of the Amorites.  "
"6821","Judges","10","9","The Ammonites also crossed the Jordan to fight against Judah, Benjamin and Ephraim; Israel was in great distress.  "
"6822","Judges","10","10","Then the Israelites cried out to the  Lord , “We have sinned against you, forsaking our God and serving the Baals.” "
"6823","Judges","10","11","The  Lord  replied, “When the Egyptians, the Amorites, the Ammonites, the Philistines,  "
"6824","Judges","10","12","the Sidonians, the Amalekites and the Maonites  oppressed you and you cried to me for help, did I not save you from their hands?  "
"6825","Judges","10","13","But you have forsaken me and served other gods, so I will no longer save you.  "
"6826","Judges","10","14","Go and cry out to the gods you have chosen. Let them save you when you are in trouble!” "
"6827","Judges","10","15","But the Israelites said to the  Lord , “We have sinned. Do with us whatever you think best, but please rescue us now.”  "
"6828","Judges","10","16","Then they got rid of the foreign gods among them and served the  Lord . And he could bear Israel’s misery no longer. "
"6829","Judges","10","17","When the Ammonites were called to arms and camped in Gilead, the Israelites assembled and camped at Mizpah.  "
"6830","Judges","10","18","The leaders of the people of Gilead said to each other, “Whoever will take the lead in attacking the Ammonites will be head over all who live in Gilead.”"
"6831","Judges","11","1","Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty warrior. His father was Gilead; his mother was a prostitute.  "
"6832","Judges","11","2","Gilead’s wife also bore him sons, and when they were grown up, they drove Jephthah away. “You are not going to get any inheritance in our family,” they said, “because you are the son of another woman.”  "
"6833","Judges","11","3","So Jephthah fled from his brothers and settled in the land of Tob, where a gang of scoundrels gathered around him and followed him. "
"6834","Judges","11","4","Some time later, when the Ammonites were fighting against Israel,  "
"6835","Judges","11","5","the elders of Gilead went to get Jephthah from the land of Tob.  "
"6836","Judges","11","6","“Come,” they said, “be our commander, so we can fight the Ammonites.” "
"6837","Judges","11","7","Jephthah said to them, “Didn’t you hate me and drive me from my father’s house? Why do you come to me now, when you’re in trouble?” "
"6838","Judges","11","8","The elders of Gilead said to him, “Nevertheless, we are turning to you now; come with us to fight the Ammonites, and you will be head over all of us who live in Gilead.” "
"6839","Judges","11","9","Jephthah answered, “Suppose you take me back to fight the Ammonites and the  Lord  gives them to me—will I really be your head?” "
"6840","Judges","11","10","The elders of Gilead replied, “The  Lord  is our witness; we will certainly do as you say.”  "
"6841","Judges","11","11","So Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him head and commander over them. And he repeated all his words before the  Lord  in Mizpah. "
"6842","Judges","11","12","Then Jephthah sent messengers to the Ammonite king with the question: “What do you have against me that you have attacked my country?” "
"6843","Judges","11","13","The king of the Ammonites answered Jephthah’s messengers, “When Israel came up out of Egypt, they took away my land from the Arnon to the Jabbok, all the way to the Jordan. Now give it back peaceably.” "
"6844","Judges","11","14","Jephthah sent back messengers to the Ammonite king,  "
"6845","Judges","11","15","saying: “This is what Jephthah says: Israel did not take the land of Moab or the land of the Ammonites.  "
"6846","Judges","11","16","But when they came up out of Egypt, Israel went through the wilderness to the Red Sea  and on to Kadesh.  "
"6847","Judges","11","17","Then Israel sent messengers to the king of Edom, saying, ‘Give us permission to go through your country,’ but the king of Edom would not listen. They sent also to the king of Moab, and he refused. So Israel stayed at Kadesh. "
"6848","Judges","11","18","“Next they traveled through the wilderness, skirted the lands of Edom and Moab, passed along the eastern side of the country of Moab, and camped on the other side of the Arnon. They did not enter the territory of Moab, for the Arnon was its border. "
"6849","Judges","11","19","“Then Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, who ruled in Heshbon, and said to him, ‘Let us pass through your country to our own place.’  "
"6850","Judges","11","20","Sihon, however, did not trust Israel  to pass through his territory. He mustered all his troops and encamped at Jahaz and fought with Israel. "
"6851","Judges","11","21","“Then the  Lord , the God of Israel, gave Sihon and his whole army into Israel’s hands, and they defeated them. Israel took over all the land of the Amorites who lived in that country,  "
"6852","Judges","11","22","capturing all of it from the Arnon to the Jabbok and from the desert to the Jordan. "
"6853","Judges","11","23","“Now since the  Lord , the God of Israel, has driven the Amorites out before his people Israel, what right have you to take it over?  "
"6854","Judges","11","24","Will you not take what your god Chemosh gives you? Likewise, whatever the  Lord  our God has given us, we will possess.  "
"6855","Judges","11","25","Are you any better than Balak son of Zippor, king of Moab? Did he ever quarrel with Israel or fight with them?  "
"6856","Judges","11","26","For three hundred years Israel occupied Heshbon, Aroer, the surrounding settlements and all the towns along the Arnon. Why didn’t you retake them during that time?  "
"6857","Judges","11","27","I have not wronged you, but you are doing me wrong by waging war against me. Let the  Lord , the Judge, decide the dispute this day between the Israelites and the Ammonites.” "
"6858","Judges","11","28","The king of Ammon, however, paid no attention to the message Jephthah sent him. "
"6859","Judges","11","29","Then the Spirit of the  Lord  came on Jephthah. He crossed Gilead and Manasseh, passed through Mizpah of Gilead, and from there he advanced against the Ammonites.  "
"6860","Judges","11","30","And Jephthah made a vow to the  Lord : “If you give the Ammonites into my hands,  "
"6861","Judges","11","31","whatever comes out of the door of my house to meet me when I return in triumph from the Ammonites will be the  Lord ’s, and I will sacrifice it as a burnt offering.” "
"6862","Judges","11","32","Then Jephthah went over to fight the Ammonites, and the  Lord  gave them into his hands.  "
"6863","Judges","11","33","He devastated twenty towns from Aroer to the vicinity of Minnith, as far as Abel Keramim. Thus Israel subdued Ammon. "
"6864","Judges","11","34","When Jephthah returned to his home in Mizpah, who should come out to meet him but his daughter, dancing to the sound of timbrels! She was an only child. Except for her he had neither son nor daughter.  "
"6865","Judges","11","35","When he saw her, he tore his clothes and cried, “Oh no, my daughter! You have brought me down and I am devastated. I have made a vow to the  Lord  that I cannot break.” "
"6866","Judges","11","36","“My father,” she replied, “you have given your word to the  Lord . Do to me just as you promised, now that the  Lord  has avenged you of your enemies, the Ammonites.  "
"6867","Judges","11","37","But grant me this one request,” she said. “Give me two months to roam the hills and weep with my friends, because I will never marry.” "
"6868","Judges","11","38","“You may go,” he said. And he let her go for two months. She and her friends went into the hills and wept because she would never marry.  "
"6869","Judges","11","39","After the two months, she returned to her father, and he did to her as he had vowed. And she was a virgin. From this comes the Israelite tradition  "
"6870","Judges","11","40","that each year the young women of Israel go out for four days to commemorate the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite."
"6871","Judges","12","1","The Ephraimite forces were called out, and they crossed over to Zaphon. They said to Jephthah, “Why did you go to fight the Ammonites without calling us to go with you? We’re going to burn down your house over your head.” "
"6872","Judges","12","2","Jephthah answered, “I and my people were engaged in a great struggle with the Ammonites, and although I called, you didn’t save me out of their hands.  "
"6873","Judges","12","3","When I saw that you wouldn’t help, I took my life in my hands and crossed over to fight the Ammonites, and the  Lord  gave me the victory over them. Now why have you come up today to fight me?” "
"6874","Judges","12","4","Jephthah then called together the men of Gilead and fought against Ephraim. The Gileadites struck them down because the Ephraimites had said, “You Gileadites are renegades from Ephraim and Manasseh.”  "
"6875","Judges","12","5","The Gileadites captured the fords of the Jordan leading to Ephraim, and whenever a survivor of Ephraim said, “Let me cross over,” the men of Gilead asked him, “Are you an Ephraimite?” If he replied, “No,”  "
"6876","Judges","12","6","they said, “All right, say ‘Shibboleth.’ ” If he said, “Sibboleth,” because he could not pronounce the word correctly, they seized him and killed him at the fords of the Jordan. Forty-two thousand Ephraimites were killed at that time. "
"6877","Judges","12","7","Jephthah led  Israel six years. Then Jephthah the Gileadite died and was buried in a town in Gilead. "
"6878","Judges","12","8","After him, Ibzan of Bethlehem led Israel.  "
"6879","Judges","12","9","He had thirty sons and thirty daughters. He gave his daughters away in marriage to those outside his clan, and for his sons he brought in thirty young women as wives from outside his clan. Ibzan led Israel seven years.  "
"6880","Judges","12","10","Then Ibzan died and was buried in Bethlehem. "
"6881","Judges","12","11","After him, Elon the Zebulunite led Israel ten years.  "
"6882","Judges","12","12","Then Elon died and was buried in Aijalon in the land of Zebulun. "
"6883","Judges","12","13","After him, Abdon son of Hillel, from Pirathon, led Israel.  "
"6884","Judges","12","14","He had forty sons and thirty grandsons, who rode on seventy donkeys. He led Israel eight years.  "
"6885","Judges","12","15","Then Abdon son of Hillel died and was buried at Pirathon in Ephraim, in the hill country of the Amalekites."
"6886","Judges","13","1","Again the Israelites did evil in the eyes of the  Lord , so the  Lord  delivered them into the hands of the Philistines for forty years. "
"6887","Judges","13","2","A certain man of Zorah, named Manoah, from the clan of the Danites, had a wife who was childless, unable to give birth.  "
"6888","Judges","13","3","The angel of the  Lord  appeared to her and said, “You are barren and childless, but you are going to become pregnant and give birth to a son.  "
"6889","Judges","13","4","Now see to it that you drink no wine or other fermented drink and that you do not eat anything unclean.  "
"6890","Judges","13","5","You will become pregnant and have a son whose head is never to be touched by a razor because the boy is to be a Nazirite, dedicated to God from the womb. He will take the lead in delivering Israel from the hands of the Philistines.” "
"6891","Judges","13","6","Then the woman went to her husband and told him, “A man of God came to me. He looked like an angel of God, very awesome. I didn’t ask him where he came from, and he didn’t tell me his name.  "
"6892","Judges","13","7","But he said to me, ‘You will become pregnant and have a son. Now then, drink no wine or other fermented drink and do not eat anything unclean, because the boy will be a Nazirite of God from the womb until the day of his death.’ ” "
"6893","Judges","13","8","Then Manoah prayed to the  Lord : “Pardon your servant, Lord. I beg you to let the man of God you sent to us come again to teach us how to bring up the boy who is to be born.” "
"6894","Judges","13","9","God heard Manoah, and the angel of God came again to the woman while she was out in the field; but her husband Manoah was not with her.  "
"6895","Judges","13","10","The woman hurried to tell her husband, “He’s here! The man who appeared to me the other day!” "
"6896","Judges","13","11","Manoah got up and followed his wife. When he came to the man, he said, “Are you the man who talked to my wife?” “I am,” he said. "
"6897","Judges","13","12","So Manoah asked him, “When your words are fulfilled, what is to be the rule that governs the boy’s life and work?” "
"6898","Judges","13","13","The angel of the  Lord  answered, “Your wife must do all that I have told her.  "
"6899","Judges","13","14","She must not eat anything that comes from the grapevine, nor drink any wine or other fermented drink nor eat anything unclean. She must do everything I have commanded her.” "
"6900","Judges","13","15","Manoah said to the angel of the  Lord , “We would like you to stay until we prepare a young goat for you.” "
"6901","Judges","13","16","The angel of the  Lord  replied, “Even though you detain me, I will not eat any of your food. But if you prepare a burnt offering, offer it to the  Lord .” (Manoah did not realize that it was the angel of the  Lord .) "
"6902","Judges","13","17","Then Manoah inquired of the angel of the  Lord , “What is your name, so that we may honor you when your word comes true?” "
"6903","Judges","13","18","He replied, “Why do you ask my name? It is beyond understanding. ”  "
"6904","Judges","13","19","Then Manoah took a young goat, together with the grain offering, and sacrificed it on a rock to the  Lord . And the  Lord  did an amazing thing while Manoah and his wife watched:  "
"6905","Judges","13","20","As the flame blazed up from the altar toward heaven, the angel of the  Lord  ascended in the flame. Seeing this, Manoah and his wife fell with their faces to the ground.  "
"6906","Judges","13","21","When the angel of the  Lord  did not show himself again to Manoah and his wife, Manoah realized that it was the angel of the  Lord . "
"6907","Judges","13","22","“We are doomed to die!” he said to his wife. “We have seen God!” "
"6908","Judges","13","23","But his wife answered, “If the  Lord  had meant to kill us, he would not have accepted a burnt offering and grain offering from our hands, nor shown us all these things or now told us this.” "
"6909","Judges","13","24","The woman gave birth to a boy and named him Samson. He grew and the  Lord  blessed him,  "
"6910","Judges","13","25","and the Spirit of the  Lord  began to stir him while he was in Mahaneh Dan, between Zorah and Eshtaol."
"6911","Judges","14","1","Samson went down to Timnah and saw there a young Philistine woman.  "
"6912","Judges","14","2","When he returned, he said to his father and mother, “I have seen a Philistine woman in Timnah; now get her for me as my wife.” "
"6913","Judges","14","3","His father and mother replied, “Isn’t there an acceptable woman among your relatives or among all our people? Must you go to the uncircumcised Philistines to get a wife?” But Samson said to his father, “Get her for me. She’s the right one for me.”  "
"6914","Judges","14","4","(His parents did not know that this was from the  Lord , who was seeking an occasion to confront the Philistines; for at that time they were ruling over Israel.) "
"6915","Judges","14","5","Samson went down to Timnah together with his father and mother. As they approached the vineyards of Timnah, suddenly a young lion came roaring toward him.  "
"6916","Judges","14","6","The Spirit of the  Lord  came powerfully upon him so that he tore the lion apart with his bare hands as he might have torn a young goat. But he told neither his father nor his mother what he had done.  "
"6917","Judges","14","7","Then he went down and talked with the woman, and he liked her. "
"6918","Judges","14","8","Some time later, when he went back to marry her, he turned aside to look at the lion’s carcass, and in it he saw a swarm of bees and some honey.  "
"6919","Judges","14","9","He scooped out the honey with his hands and ate as he went along. When he rejoined his parents, he gave them some, and they too ate it. But he did not tell them that he had taken the honey from the lion’s carcass. "
"6920","Judges","14","10","Now his father went down to see the woman. And there Samson held a feast, as was customary for young men.  "
"6921","Judges","14","11","When the people saw him, they chose thirty men to be his companions. "
"6922","Judges","14","12","“Let me tell you a riddle,” Samson said to them. “If you can give me the answer within the seven days of the feast, I will give you thirty linen garments and thirty sets of clothes.  "
"6923","Judges","14","13","If you can’t tell me the answer, you must give me thirty linen garments and thirty sets of clothes.” “Tell us your riddle,” they said. “Let’s hear it.” "
"6924","Judges","14","14","He replied, “Out of the eater, something to eat; out of the strong, something sweet.” For three days they could not give the answer. "
"6925","Judges","14","15","On the fourth  day, they said to Samson’s wife, “Coax your husband into explaining the riddle for us, or we will burn you and your father’s household to death. Did you invite us here to steal our property?” "
"6926","Judges","14","16","Then Samson’s wife threw herself on him, sobbing, “You hate me! You don’t really love me. You’ve given my people a riddle, but you haven’t told me the answer.” “I haven’t even explained it to my father or mother,” he replied, “so why should I explain it to you?”  "
"6927","Judges","14","17","She cried the whole seven days of the feast. So on the seventh day he finally told her, because she continued to press him. She in turn explained the riddle to her people. "
"6928","Judges","14","18","Before sunset on the seventh day the men of the town said to him, “What is sweeter than honey? What is stronger than a lion?” Samson said to them, “If you had not plowed with my heifer, you would not have solved my riddle.” "
"6929","Judges","14","19","Then the Spirit of the  Lord  came powerfully upon him. He went down to Ashkelon, struck down thirty of their men, stripped them of everything and gave their clothes to those who had explained the riddle. Burning with anger, he returned to his father’s home.  "
"6930","Judges","14","20","And Samson’s wife was given to one of his companions who had attended him at the feast."
"6931","Judges","15","1","Later on, at the time of wheat harvest, Samson took a young goat and went to visit his wife. He said, “I’m going to my wife’s room.” But her father would not let him go in. "
"6932","Judges","15","2","“I was so sure you hated her,” he said, “that I gave her to your companion. Isn’t her younger sister more attractive? Take her instead.” "
"6933","Judges","15","3","Samson said to them, “This time I have a right to get even with the Philistines; I will really harm them.”  "
"6934","Judges","15","4","So he went out and caught three hundred foxes and tied them tail to tail in pairs. He then fastened a torch to every pair of tails,  "
"6935","Judges","15","5","lit the torches and let the foxes loose in the standing grain of the Philistines. He burned up the shocks and standing grain, together with the vineyards and olive groves. "
"6936","Judges","15","6","When the Philistines asked, “Who did this?” they were told, “Samson, the Timnite’s son-in-law, because his wife was given to his companion.” So the Philistines went up and burned her and her father to death.  "
"6937","Judges","15","7","Samson said to them, “Since you’ve acted like this, I swear that I won’t stop until I get my revenge on you.”  "
"6938","Judges","15","8","He attacked them viciously and slaughtered many of them. Then he went down and stayed in a cave in the rock of Etam. "
"6939","Judges","15","9","The Philistines went up and camped in Judah, spreading out near Lehi.  "
"6940","Judges","15","10","The people of Judah asked, “Why have you come to fight us?” “We have come to take Samson prisoner,” they answered, “to do to him as he did to us.” "
"6941","Judges","15","11","Then three thousand men from Judah went down to the cave in the rock of Etam and said to Samson, “Don’t you realize that the Philistines are rulers over us? What have you done to us?” He answered, “I merely did to them what they did to me.” "
"6942","Judges","15","12","They said to him, “We’ve come to tie you up and hand you over to the Philistines.” Samson said, “Swear to me that you won’t kill me yourselves.” "
"6943","Judges","15","13","“Agreed,” they answered. “We will only tie you up and hand you over to them. We will not kill you.” So they bound him with two new ropes and led him up from the rock.  "
"6944","Judges","15","14","As he approached Lehi, the Philistines came toward him shouting. The Spirit of the  Lord  came powerfully upon him. The ropes on his arms became like charred flax, and the bindings dropped from his hands.  "
"6945","Judges","15","15","Finding a fresh jawbone of a donkey, he grabbed it and struck down a thousand men. "
"6946","Judges","15","16","Then Samson said, “With a donkey’s jawbone I have made donkeys of them. With a donkey’s jawbone I have killed a thousand men.” "
"6947","Judges","15","17","When he finished speaking, he threw away the jawbone; and the place was called Ramath Lehi. "
"6948","Judges","15","18","Because he was very thirsty, he cried out to the  Lord , “You have given your servant this great victory. Must I now die of thirst and fall into the hands of the uncircumcised?”  "
"6949","Judges","15","19","Then God opened up the hollow place in Lehi, and water came out of it. When Samson drank, his strength returned and he revived. So the spring was called En Hakkore,  and it is still there in Lehi. "
"6950","Judges","15","20","Samson led  Israel for twenty years in the days of the Philistines."
"6951","Judges","16","1","One day Samson went to Gaza, where he saw a prostitute. He went in to spend the night with her.  "
"6952","Judges","16","2","The people of Gaza were told, “Samson is here!” So they surrounded the place and lay in wait for him all night at the city gate. They made no move during the night, saying, “At dawn we’ll kill him.” "
"6953","Judges","16","3","But Samson lay there only until the middle of the night. Then he got up and took hold of the doors of the city gate, together with the two posts, and tore them loose, bar and all. He lifted them to his shoulders and carried them to the top of the hill that faces Hebron. "
"6954","Judges","16","4","Some time later, he fell in love with a woman in the Valley of Sorek whose name was Delilah.  "
"6955","Judges","16","5","The rulers of the Philistines went to her and said, “See if you can lure him into showing you the secret of his great strength and how we can overpower him so we may tie him up and subdue him. Each one of us will give you eleven hundred shekels  of silver.” "
"6956","Judges","16","6","So Delilah said to Samson, “Tell me the secret of your great strength and how you can be tied up and subdued.” "
"6957","Judges","16","7","Samson answered her, “If anyone ties me with seven fresh bowstrings that have not been dried, I’ll become as weak as any other man.” "
"6958","Judges","16","8","Then the rulers of the Philistines brought her seven fresh bowstrings that had not been dried, and she tied him with them.  "
"6959","Judges","16","9","With men hidden in the room, she called to him, “Samson, the Philistines are upon you!” But he snapped the bowstrings as easily as a piece of string snaps when it comes close to a flame. So the secret of his strength was not discovered. "
"6960","Judges","16","10","Then Delilah said to Samson, “You have made a fool of me; you lied to me. Come now, tell me how you can be tied.” "
"6961","Judges","16","11","He said, “If anyone ties me securely with new ropes that have never been used, I’ll become as weak as any other man.” "
"6962","Judges","16","12","So Delilah took new ropes and tied him with them. Then, with men hidden in the room, she called to him, “Samson, the Philistines are upon you!” But he snapped the ropes off his arms as if they were threads. "
"6963","Judges","16","13","Delilah then said to Samson, “All this time you have been making a fool of me and lying to me. Tell me how you can be tied.” He replied, “If you weave the seven braids of my head into the fabric on the loom and tighten it with the pin, I’ll become as weak as any other man.” So while he was sleeping, Delilah took the seven braids of his head, wove them into the fabric  "
"6964","Judges","16","14","and  tightened it with the pin. Again she called to him, “Samson, the Philistines are upon you!” He awoke from his sleep and pulled up the pin and the loom, with the fabric. "
"6965","Judges","16","15","Then she said to him, “How can you say, ‘I love you,’ when you won’t confide in me? This is the third time you have made a fool of me and haven’t told me the secret of your great strength.”  "
"6966","Judges","16","16","With such nagging she prodded him day after day until he was sick to death of it. "
"6967","Judges","16","17","So he told her everything. “No razor has ever been used on my head,” he said, “because I have been a Nazirite dedicated to God from my mother’s womb. If my head were shaved, my strength would leave me, and I would become as weak as any other man.” "
"6968","Judges","16","18","When Delilah saw that he had told her everything, she sent word to the rulers of the Philistines, “Come back once more; he has told me everything.” So the rulers of the Philistines returned with the silver in their hands.  "
"6969","Judges","16","19","After putting him to sleep on her lap, she called for someone to shave off the seven braids of his hair, and so began to subdue him.  And his strength left him. "
"6970","Judges","16","20","Then she called, “Samson, the Philistines are upon you!” He awoke from his sleep and thought, “I’ll go out as before and shake myself free.” But he did not know that the  Lord  had left him. "
"6971","Judges","16","21","Then the Philistines seized him, gouged out his eyes and took him down to Gaza. Binding him with bronze shackles, they set him to grinding grain in the prison.  "
"6972","Judges","16","22","But the hair on his head began to grow again after it had been shaved. "
"6973","Judges","16","23","Now the rulers of the Philistines assembled to offer a great sacrifice to Dagon their god and to celebrate, saying, “Our god has delivered Samson, our enemy, into our hands.” "
"6974","Judges","16","24","When the people saw him, they praised their god, saying, “Our god has delivered our enemy into our hands, the one who laid waste our land and multiplied our slain.” "
"6975","Judges","16","25","While they were in high spirits, they shouted, “Bring out Samson to entertain us.” So they called Samson out of the prison, and he performed for them. When they stood him among the pillars,  "
"6976","Judges","16","26","Samson said to the servant who held his hand, “Put me where I can feel the pillars that support the temple, so that I may lean against them.”  "
"6977","Judges","16","27","Now the temple was crowded with men and women; all the rulers of the Philistines were there, and on the roof were about three thousand men and women watching Samson perform.  "
"6978","Judges","16","28","Then Samson prayed to the  Lord , “Sovereign  Lord , remember me. Please, God, strengthen me just once more, and let me with one blow get revenge on the Philistines for my two eyes.”  "
"6979","Judges","16","29","Then Samson reached toward the two central pillars on which the temple stood. Bracing himself against them, his right hand on the one and his left hand on the other,  "
"6980","Judges","16","30","Samson said, “Let me die with the Philistines!” Then he pushed with all his might, and down came the temple on the rulers and all the people in it. Thus he killed many more when he died than while he lived. "
"6981","Judges","16","31","Then his brothers and his father’s whole family went down to get him. They brought him back and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the tomb of Manoah his father. He had led  Israel twenty years."
"6982","Judges","17","1","Now a man named Micah from the hill country of Ephraim  "
"6983","Judges","17","2","said to his mother, “The eleven hundred shekels  of silver that were taken from you and about which I heard you utter a curse—I have that silver with me; I took it.” Then his mother said, “The  Lord  bless you, my son!” "
"6984","Judges","17","3","When he returned the eleven hundred shekels of silver to his mother, she said, “I solemnly consecrate my silver to the  Lord  for my son to make an image overlaid with silver. I will give it back to you.” "
"6985","Judges","17","4","So after he returned the silver to his mother, she took two hundred shekels  of silver and gave them to a silversmith, who used them to make the idol. And it was put in Micah’s house. "
"6986","Judges","17","5","Now this man Micah had a shrine, and he made an ephod and some household gods and installed one of his sons as his priest.  "
"6987","Judges","17","6","In those days Israel had no king; everyone did as they saw fit. "
"6988","Judges","17","7","A young Levite from Bethlehem in Judah, who had been living within the clan of Judah,  "
"6989","Judges","17","8","left that town in search of some other place to stay. On his way  he came to Micah’s house in the hill country of Ephraim. "
"6990","Judges","17","9","Micah asked him, “Where are you from?” “I’m a Levite from Bethlehem in Judah,” he said, “and I’m looking for a place to stay.” "
"6991","Judges","17","10","Then Micah said to him, “Live with me and be my father and priest, and I’ll give you ten shekels  of silver a year, your clothes and your food.”  "
"6992","Judges","17","11","So the Levite agreed to live with him, and the young man became like one of his sons to him.  "
"6993","Judges","17","12","Then Micah installed the Levite, and the young man became his priest and lived in his house.  "
"6994","Judges","17","13","And Micah said, “Now I know that the  Lord  will be good to me, since this Levite has become my priest.”"
"6995","Judges","18","1","In those days Israel had no king. And in those days the tribe of the Danites was seeking a place of their own where they might settle, because they had not yet come into an inheritance among the tribes of Israel.  "
"6996","Judges","18","2","So the Danites sent five of their leading men from Zorah and Eshtaol to spy out the land and explore it. These men represented all the Danites. They told them, “Go, explore the land.” So they entered the hill country of Ephraim and came to the house of Micah, where they spent the night.  "
"6997","Judges","18","3","When they were near Micah’s house, they recognized the voice of the young Levite; so they turned in there and asked him, “Who brought you here? What are you doing in this place? Why are you here?” "
"6998","Judges","18","4","He told them what Micah had done for him, and said, “He has hired me and I am his priest.” "
"6999","Judges","18","5","Then they said to him, “Please inquire of God to learn whether our journey will be successful.” "
"7000","Judges","18","6","The priest answered them, “Go in peace. Your journey has the  Lord ’s approval.” "
"7001","Judges","18","7","So the five men left and came to Laish, where they saw that the people were living in safety, like the Sidonians, at peace and secure. And since their land lacked nothing, they were prosperous.  Also, they lived a long way from the Sidonians and had no relationship with anyone else. "
"7002","Judges","18","8","When they returned to Zorah and Eshtaol, their fellow Danites asked them, “How did you find things?” "
"7003","Judges","18","9","They answered, “Come on, let’s attack them! We have seen the land, and it is very good. Aren’t you going to do something? Don’t hesitate to go there and take it over.  "
"7004","Judges","18","10","When you get there, you will find an unsuspecting people and a spacious land that God has put into your hands, a land that lacks nothing whatever.” "
"7005","Judges","18","11","Then six hundred men of the Danites, armed for battle, set out from Zorah and Eshtaol.  "
"7006","Judges","18","12","On their way they set up camp near Kiriath Jearim in Judah. This is why the place west of Kiriath Jearim is called Mahaneh Dan  to this day.  "
"7007","Judges","18","13","From there they went on to the hill country of Ephraim and came to Micah’s house. "
"7008","Judges","18","14","Then the five men who had spied out the land of Laish said to their fellow Danites, “Do you know that one of these houses has an ephod, some household gods and an image overlaid with silver? Now you know what to do.”  "
"7009","Judges","18","15","So they turned in there and went to the house of the young Levite at Micah’s place and greeted him.  "
"7010","Judges","18","16","The six hundred Danites, armed for battle, stood at the entrance of the gate.  "
"7011","Judges","18","17","The five men who had spied out the land went inside and took the idol, the ephod and the household gods while the priest and the six hundred armed men stood at the entrance of the gate. "
"7012","Judges","18","18","When the five men went into Micah’s house and took the idol, the ephod and the household gods, the priest said to them, “What are you doing?” "
"7013","Judges","18","19","They answered him, “Be quiet! Don’t say a word. Come with us, and be our father and priest. Isn’t it better that you serve a tribe and clan in Israel as priest rather than just one man’s household?”  "
"7014","Judges","18","20","The priest was very pleased. He took the ephod, the household gods and the idol and went along with the people.  "
"7015","Judges","18","21","Putting their little children, their livestock and their possessions in front of them, they turned away and left. "
"7016","Judges","18","22","When they had gone some distance from Micah’s house, the men who lived near Micah were called together and overtook the Danites.  "
"7017","Judges","18","23","As they shouted after them, the Danites turned and said to Micah, “What’s the matter with you that you called out your men to fight?” "
"7018","Judges","18","24","He replied, “You took the gods I made, and my priest, and went away. What else do I have? How can you ask, ‘What’s the matter with you?’ ” "
"7019","Judges","18","25","The Danites answered, “Don’t argue with us, or some of the men may get angry and attack you, and you and your family will lose your lives.”  "
"7020","Judges","18","26","So the Danites went their way, and Micah, seeing that they were too strong for him, turned around and went back home. "
"7021","Judges","18","27","Then they took what Micah had made, and his priest, and went on to Laish, against a people at peace and secure. They attacked them with the sword and burned down their city.  "
"7022","Judges","18","28","There was no one to rescue them because they lived a long way from Sidon and had no relationship with anyone else. The city was in a valley near Beth Rehob. The Danites rebuilt the city and settled there.  "
"7023","Judges","18","29","They named it Dan after their ancestor Dan, who was born to Israel—though the city used to be called Laish.  "
"7024","Judges","18","30","There the Danites set up for themselves the idol, and Jonathan son of Gershom, the son of Moses,  and his sons were priests for the tribe of Dan until the time of the captivity of the land.  "
"7025","Judges","18","31","They continued to use the idol Micah had made, all the time the house of God was in Shiloh."
"7026","Judges","19","1","In those days Israel had no king. Now a Levite who lived in a remote area in the hill country of Ephraim took a concubine from Bethlehem in Judah.  "
"7027","Judges","19","2","But she was unfaithful to him. She left him and went back to her parents’ home in Bethlehem, Judah. After she had been there four months,  "
"7028","Judges","19","3","her husband went to her to persuade her to return. He had with him his servant and two donkeys. She took him into her parents’ home, and when her father saw him, he gladly welcomed him.  "
"7029","Judges","19","4","His father-in-law, the woman’s father, prevailed on him to stay; so he remained with him three days, eating and drinking, and sleeping there. "
"7030","Judges","19","5","On the fourth day they got up early and he prepared to leave, but the woman’s father said to his son-in-law, “Refresh yourself with something to eat; then you can go.”  "
"7031","Judges","19","6","So the two of them sat down to eat and drink together. Afterward the woman’s father said, “Please stay tonight and enjoy yourself.”  "
"7032","Judges","19","7","And when the man got up to go, his father-in-law persuaded him, so he stayed there that night.  "
"7033","Judges","19","8","On the morning of the fifth day, when he rose to go, the woman’s father said, “Refresh yourself. Wait till afternoon!” So the two of them ate together. "
"7034","Judges","19","9","Then when the man, with his concubine and his servant, got up to leave, his father-in-law, the woman’s father, said, “Now look, it’s almost evening. Spend the night here; the day is nearly over. Stay and enjoy yourself. Early tomorrow morning you can get up and be on your way home.”  "
"7035","Judges","19","10","But, unwilling to stay another night, the man left and went toward Jebus (that is, Jerusalem), with his two saddled donkeys and his concubine. "
"7036","Judges","19","11","When they were near Jebus and the day was almost gone, the servant said to his master, “Come, let’s stop at this city of the Jebusites and spend the night.” "
"7037","Judges","19","12","His master replied, “No. We won’t go into any city whose people are not Israelites. We will go on to Gibeah.”  "
"7038","Judges","19","13","He added, “Come, let’s try to reach Gibeah or Ramah and spend the night in one of those places.”  "
"7039","Judges","19","14","So they went on, and the sun set as they neared Gibeah in Benjamin.  "
"7040","Judges","19","15","There they stopped to spend the night. They went and sat in the city square, but no one took them in for the night. "
"7041","Judges","19","16","That evening an old man from the hill country of Ephraim, who was living in Gibeah (the inhabitants of the place were Benjamites), came in from his work in the fields.  "
"7042","Judges","19","17","When he looked and saw the traveler in the city square, the old man asked, “Where are you going? Where did you come from?” "
"7043","Judges","19","18","He answered, “We are on our way from Bethlehem in Judah to a remote area in the hill country of Ephraim where I live. I have been to Bethlehem in Judah and now I am going to the house of the  Lord .  No one has taken me in for the night.  "
"7044","Judges","19","19","We have both straw and fodder for our donkeys and bread and wine for ourselves your servants—me, the woman and the young man with us. We don’t need anything.” "
"7045","Judges","19","20","“You are welcome at my house,” the old man said. “Let me supply whatever you need. Only don’t spend the night in the square.”  "
"7046","Judges","19","21","So he took him into his house and fed his donkeys. After they had washed their feet, they had something to eat and drink. "
"7047","Judges","19","22","While they were enjoying themselves, some of the wicked men of the city surrounded the house. Pounding on the door, they shouted to the old man who owned the house, “Bring out the man who came to your house so we can have sex with him.” "
"7048","Judges","19","23","The owner of the house went outside and said to them, “No, my friends, don’t be so vile. Since this man is my guest, don’t do this outrageous thing.  "
"7049","Judges","19","24","Look, here is my virgin daughter, and his concubine. I will bring them out to you now, and you can use them and do to them whatever you wish. But as for this man, don’t do such an outrageous thing.” "
"7050","Judges","19","25","But the men would not listen to him. So the man took his concubine and sent her outside to them, and they raped her and abused her throughout the night, and at dawn they let her go.  "
"7051","Judges","19","26","At daybreak the woman went back to the house where her master was staying, fell down at the door and lay there until daylight. "
"7052","Judges","19","27","When her master got up in the morning and opened the door of the house and stepped out to continue on his way, there lay his concubine, fallen in the doorway of the house, with her hands on the threshold.  "
"7053","Judges","19","28","He said to her, “Get up; let’s go.” But there was no answer. Then the man put her on his donkey and set out for home. "
"7054","Judges","19","29","When he reached home, he took a knife and cut up his concubine, limb by limb, into twelve parts and sent them into all the areas of Israel.  "
"7055","Judges","19","30","Everyone who saw it was saying to one another, “Such a thing has never been seen or done, not since the day the Israelites came up out of Egypt. Just imagine! We must do something! So speak up!”"
"7056","Judges","20","1","Then all Israel from Dan to Beersheba and from the land of Gilead came together as one and assembled before the  Lord  in Mizpah.  "
"7057","Judges","20","2","The leaders of all the people of the tribes of Israel took their places in the assembly of God’s people, four hundred thousand men armed with swords.  "
"7058","Judges","20","3","(The Benjamites heard that the Israelites had gone up to Mizpah.) Then the Israelites said, “Tell us how this awful thing happened.” "
"7059","Judges","20","4","So the Levite, the husband of the murdered woman, said, “I and my concubine came to Gibeah in Benjamin to spend the night.  "
"7060","Judges","20","5","During the night the men of Gibeah came after me and surrounded the house, intending to kill me. They raped my concubine, and she died.  "
"7061","Judges","20","6","I took my concubine, cut her into pieces and sent one piece to each region of Israel’s inheritance, because they committed this lewd and outrageous act in Israel.  "
"7062","Judges","20","7","Now, all you Israelites, speak up and tell me what you have decided to do.” "
"7063","Judges","20","8","All the men rose up together as one, saying, “None of us will go home. No, not one of us will return to his house.  "
"7064","Judges","20","9","But now this is what we’ll do to Gibeah: We’ll go up against it in the order decided by casting lots.  "
"7065","Judges","20","10","We’ll take ten men out of every hundred from all the tribes of Israel, and a hundred from a thousand, and a thousand from ten thousand, to get provisions for the army. Then, when the army arrives at Gibeah  in Benjamin, it can give them what they deserve for this outrageous act done in Israel.”  "
"7066","Judges","20","11","So all the Israelites got together and united as one against the city. "
"7067","Judges","20","12","The tribes of Israel sent messengers throughout the tribe of Benjamin, saying, “What about this awful crime that was committed among you?  "
"7068","Judges","20","13","Now turn those wicked men of Gibeah over to us so that we may put them to death and purge the evil from Israel.” But the Benjamites would not listen to their fellow Israelites.  "
"7069","Judges","20","14","From their towns they came together at Gibeah to fight against the Israelites.  "
"7070","Judges","20","15","At once the Benjamites mobilized twenty-six thousand swordsmen from their towns, in addition to seven hundred able young men from those living in Gibeah.  "
"7071","Judges","20","16","Among all these soldiers there were seven hundred select troops who were left-handed, each of whom could sling a stone at a hair and not miss. "
"7072","Judges","20","17","Israel, apart from Benjamin, mustered four hundred thousand swordsmen, all of them fit for battle. "
"7073","Judges","20","18","The Israelites went up to Bethel  and inquired of God. They said, “Who of us is to go up first to fight against the Benjamites?” The  Lord  replied, “Judah shall go first.” "
"7074","Judges","20","19","The next morning the Israelites got up and pitched camp near Gibeah.  "
"7075","Judges","20","20","The Israelites went out to fight the Benjamites and took up battle positions against them at Gibeah.  "
"7076","Judges","20","21","The Benjamites came out of Gibeah and cut down twenty-two thousand Israelites on the battlefield that day.  "
"7077","Judges","20","22","But the Israelites encouraged one another and again took up their positions where they had stationed themselves the first day.  "
"7078","Judges","20","23","The Israelites went up and wept before the  Lord  until evening, and they inquired of the  Lord . They said, “Shall we go up again to fight against the Benjamites, our fellow Israelites?” The  Lord  answered, “Go up against them.” "
"7079","Judges","20","24","Then the Israelites drew near to Benjamin the second day.  "
"7080","Judges","20","25","This time, when the Benjamites came out from Gibeah to oppose them, they cut down another eighteen thousand Israelites, all of them armed with swords. "
"7081","Judges","20","26","Then all the Israelites, the whole army, went up to Bethel, and there they sat weeping before the  Lord . They fasted that day until evening and presented burnt offerings and fellowship offerings to the  Lord .  "
"7082","Judges","20","27","And the Israelites inquired of the  Lord . (In those days the ark of the covenant of God was there,  "
"7083","Judges","20","28","with Phinehas son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, ministering before it.) They asked, “Shall we go up again to fight against the Benjamites, our fellow Israelites, or not?” The  Lord  responded, “Go, for tomorrow I will give them into your hands.” "
"7084","Judges","20","29","Then Israel set an ambush around Gibeah.  "
"7085","Judges","20","30","They went up against the Benjamites on the third day and took up positions against Gibeah as they had done before.  "
"7086","Judges","20","31","The Benjamites came out to meet them and were drawn away from the city. They began to inflict casualties on the Israelites as before, so that about thirty men fell in the open field and on the roads—the one leading to Bethel and the other to Gibeah.  "
"7087","Judges","20","32","While the Benjamites were saying, “We are defeating them as before,” the Israelites were saying, “Let’s retreat and draw them away from the city to the roads.” "
"7088","Judges","20","33","All the men of Israel moved from their places and took up positions at Baal Tamar, and the Israelite ambush charged out of its place on the west  of Gibeah.   "
"7089","Judges","20","34","Then ten thousand of Israel’s able young men made a frontal attack on Gibeah. The fighting was so heavy that the Benjamites did not realize how near disaster was.  "
"7090","Judges","20","35","The  Lord  defeated Benjamin before Israel, and on that day the Israelites struck down 25,100 Benjamites, all armed with swords.  "
"7091","Judges","20","36","Then the Benjamites saw that they were beaten. Now the men of Israel had given way before Benjamin, because they relied on the ambush they had set near Gibeah.  "
"7092","Judges","20","37","Those who had been in ambush made a sudden dash into Gibeah, spread out and put the whole city to the sword.  "
"7093","Judges","20","38","The Israelites had arranged with the ambush that they should send up a great cloud of smoke from the city,  "
"7094","Judges","20","39","and then the Israelites would counterattack. The Benjamites had begun to inflict casualties on the Israelites (about thirty), and they said, “We are defeating them as in the first battle.”  "
"7095","Judges","20","40","But when the column of smoke began to rise from the city, the Benjamites turned and saw the whole city going up in smoke.  "
"7096","Judges","20","41","Then the Israelites counterattacked, and the Benjamites were terrified, because they realized that disaster had come on them.  "
"7097","Judges","20","42","So they fled before the Israelites in the direction of the wilderness, but they could not escape the battle. And the Israelites who came out of the towns cut them down there.  "
"7098","Judges","20","43","They surrounded the Benjamites, chased them and easily  overran them in the vicinity of Gibeah on the east.  "
"7099","Judges","20","44","Eighteen thousand Benjamites fell, all of them valiant fighters.  "
"7100","Judges","20","45","As they turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon, the Israelites cut down five thousand men along the roads. They kept pressing after the Benjamites as far as Gidom and struck down two thousand more. "
"7101","Judges","20","46","On that day twenty-five thousand Benjamite swordsmen fell, all of them valiant fighters.  "
"7102","Judges","20","47","But six hundred of them turned and fled into the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon, where they stayed four months.  "
"7103","Judges","20","48","The men of Israel went back to Benjamin and put all the towns to the sword, including the animals and everything else they found. All the towns they came across they set on fire."
"7104","Judges","21","1","The men of Israel had taken an oath at Mizpah: “Not one of us will give his daughter in marriage to a Benjamite.” "
"7105","Judges","21","2","The people went to Bethel,  where they sat before God until evening, raising their voices and weeping bitterly.  "
"7106","Judges","21","3","“ Lord , God of Israel,” they cried, “why has this happened to Israel? Why should one tribe be missing from Israel today?” "
"7107","Judges","21","4","Early the next day the people built an altar and presented burnt offerings and fellowship offerings. "
"7108","Judges","21","5","Then the Israelites asked, “Who from all the tribes of Israel has failed to assemble before the  Lord ?” For they had taken a solemn oath that anyone who failed to assemble before the  Lord  at Mizpah was to be put to death. "
"7109","Judges","21","6","Now the Israelites grieved for the tribe of Benjamin, their fellow Israelites. “Today one tribe is cut off from Israel,” they said.  "
"7110","Judges","21","7","“How can we provide wives for those who are left, since we have taken an oath by the  Lord  not to give them any of our daughters in marriage?”  "
"7111","Judges","21","8","Then they asked, “Which one of the tribes of Israel failed to assemble before the  Lord  at Mizpah?” They discovered that no one from Jabesh Gilead had come to the camp for the assembly.  "
"7112","Judges","21","9","For when they counted the people, they found that none of the people of Jabesh Gilead were there. "
"7113","Judges","21","10","So the assembly sent twelve thousand fighting men with instructions to go to Jabesh Gilead and put to the sword those living there, including the women and children.  "
"7114","Judges","21","11","“This is what you are to do,” they said. “Kill every male and every woman who is not a virgin.”  "
"7115","Judges","21","12","They found among the people living in Jabesh Gilead four hundred young women who had never slept with a man, and they took them to the camp at Shiloh in Canaan. "
"7116","Judges","21","13","Then the whole assembly sent an offer of peace to the Benjamites at the rock of Rimmon.  "
"7117","Judges","21","14","So the Benjamites returned at that time and were given the women of Jabesh Gilead who had been spared. But there were not enough for all of them. "
"7118","Judges","21","15","The people grieved for Benjamin, because the  Lord  had made a gap in the tribes of Israel.  "
"7119","Judges","21","16","And the elders of the assembly said, “With the women of Benjamin destroyed, how shall we provide wives for the men who are left?  "
"7120","Judges","21","17","The Benjamite survivors must have heirs,” they said, “so that a tribe of Israel will not be wiped out.  "
"7121","Judges","21","18","We can’t give them our daughters as wives, since we Israelites have taken this oath: ‘Cursed be anyone who gives a wife to a Benjamite.’  "
"7122","Judges","21","19","But look, there is the annual festival of the  Lord  in Shiloh, which lies north of Bethel, east of the road that goes from Bethel to Shechem, and south of Lebonah.” "
"7123","Judges","21","20","So they instructed the Benjamites, saying, “Go and hide in the vineyards  "
"7124","Judges","21","21","and watch. When the young women of Shiloh come out to join in the dancing, rush from the vineyards and each of you seize one of them to be your wife. Then return to the land of Benjamin.  "
"7125","Judges","21","22","When their fathers or brothers complain to us, we will say to them, ‘Do us the favor of helping them, because we did not get wives for them during the war. You will not be guilty of breaking your oath because you did not give your daughters to them.’ ” "
"7126","Judges","21","23","So that is what the Benjamites did. While the young women were dancing, each man caught one and carried her off to be his wife. Then they returned to their inheritance and rebuilt the towns and settled in them. "
"7127","Judges","21","24","At that time the Israelites left that place and went home to their tribes and clans, each to his own inheritance. "
"7128","Judges","21","25","In those days Israel had no king; everyone did as they saw fit."
"7129","Ruth","1","1","In the days when the judges ruled,1:1 Traditionally judged there was a famine in the land. So a man from Bethlehem in Judah, together with his wife and two sons, went to live for a while in the country of Moab. "
"7130","Ruth","1","2","The man’s name was Elimelek, his wife’s name was Naomi, and the names of his two sons were Mahlon and Kilion. They were Ephrathites from Bethlehem, Judah. And they went to Moab and lived there."
"7131","Ruth","1","3","Now Elimelek, Naomi’s husband, died, and she was left with her two sons. "
"7132","Ruth","1","4","They married Moabite women, one named Orpah and the other Ruth. After they had lived there about ten years, "
"7133","Ruth","1","5","both Mahlon and Kilion also died, and Naomi was left without her two sons and her husband.Naomi and Ruth Return to Bethlehem"
"7134","Ruth","1","6","When Naomi heard in Moab that the Lord had come to the aid of his people by providing food for them, she and her daughters-in-law prepared to return home from there. "
"7135","Ruth","1","7","With her two daughters-in-law she left the place where she had been living and set out on the road that would take them back to the land of Judah."
"7136","Ruth","1","8","Then Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, “Go back, each of you, to your mother’s home. May the Lord show you kindness, as you have shown kindness to your dead husbands and to me. "
"7137","Ruth","1","9","May the Lord grant that each of you will find rest in the home of another husband.”Then she kissed them goodbye and they wept aloud "
"7138","Ruth","1","10","and said to her, “We will go back with you to your people.”"
"7139","Ruth","1","11","But Naomi said, “Return home, my daughters. Why would you come with me? Am I going to have any more sons, who could become your husbands? "
"7140","Ruth","1","12","Return home, my daughters; I am too old to have another husband. Even if I thought there was still hope for me—even if I had a husband tonight and then gave birth to sons— "
"7141","Ruth","1","13","would you wait until they grew up? Would you remain unmarried for them? No, my daughters. It is more bitter for me than for you, because the Lord’s hand has turned against me!”"
"7142","Ruth","1","14","At this they wept aloud again. Then Orpah kissed her mother-in-law goodbye, but Ruth clung to her. "
"7143","Ruth","1","15","""Look,” said Naomi, “your sister-in-law is going back to her people and her gods. Go back with her.”"
"7144","Ruth","1","16","But Ruth replied, “Don’t urge me to leave you or to turn back from you. Where you go I will go, and where you stay I will stay. Your people will be my people and your God my God. "
"7145","Ruth","1","17","Where you die I will die, and there I will be buried. May the Lord deal with me, be it ever so severely, if even death separates you and me.” "
"7146","Ruth","1","18","When Naomi realized that Ruth was determined to go with her, she stopped urging her."
"7147","Ruth","1","19","So the two women went on until they came to Bethlehem. When they arrived in Bethlehem, the whole town was stirred because of them, and the women exclaimed, “Can this be Naomi?” "
"7148","Ruth","1","20","""Don’t call me Naomi,1:20 Naomi means pleasant.” she told them. “Call me Mara,1:20 Mara means bitter. because the Almighty1:20 Hebrew Shaddai; also in verse 21 has made my life very bitter. "
"7149","Ruth","1","21","I went away full, but the Lord has brought me back empty. Why call me Naomi? The Lord has afflicted1:21 Or has testified against me; the Almighty has brought misfortune upon me.”"
"7150","Ruth","1","22","So Naomi returned from Moab accompanied by Ruth the Moabite, her daughter-in-law, arriving in Bethlehem as the barley harvest was beginning."
"7151","Ruth","2","1","Now Naomi had a relative on her husband’s side, a man of standing from the clan of Elimelek, whose name was Boaz."
"7152","Ruth","2","2","And Ruth the Moabite said to Naomi, “Let me go to the fields and pick up the leftover grain behind anyone in whose eyes I find favor.”Naomi said to her, “Go ahead, my daughter.” "
"7153","Ruth","2","3","So she went out, entered a field and began to glean behind the harvesters. As it turned out, she was working in a field belonging to Boaz, who was from the clan of Elimelek."
"7154","Ruth","2","4","Just then Boaz arrived from Bethlehem and greeted the harvesters, “The Lord be with you!”“The Lord bless you!” they answered."
"7155","Ruth","2","5","Boaz asked the overseer of his harvesters, “Who does that young woman belong to?”"
"7156","Ruth","2","6","The overseer replied, “She is the Moabite who came back from Moab with Naomi. "
"7157","Ruth","2","7","She said, ‘Please let me glean and gather among the sheaves behind the harvesters.’ She came into the field and has remained here from morning till now, except for a short rest in the shelter.”"
"7158","Ruth","2","8","So Boaz said to Ruth, “My daughter, listen to me. Don’t go and glean in another field and don’t go away from here. Stay here with the women who work for me. "
"7159","Ruth","2","9","Watch the field where the men are harvesting, and follow along after the women. I have told the men not to lay a hand on you. And whenever you are thirsty, go and get a drink from the water jars the men have filled.”"
"7160","Ruth","2","10","At this, she bowed down with her face to the ground. She asked him, “Why have I found such favor in your eyes that you notice me—a foreigner?”"
"7161","Ruth","2","11","Boaz replied, “I’ve been told all about what you have done for your mother-in-law since the death of your husband—how you left your father and mother and your homeland and came to live with a people you did not know before. "
"7162","Ruth","2","12","May the Lord repay you for what you have done. May you be richly rewarded by the Lord, the God of Israel, under whose wings you have come to take refuge.” "
"7163","Ruth","2","13","""May I continue to find favor in your eyes, my lord,” she said. “You have put me at ease by speaking kindly to your servant—though I do not have the standing of one of your servants.”"
"7164","Ruth","2","14","At mealtime Boaz said to her, “Come over here. Have some bread and dip it in the wine vinegar.”When she sat down with the harvesters, he offered her some roasted grain. She ate all she wanted and had some left over. "
"7165","Ruth","2","15","As she got up to glean, Boaz gave orders to his men, “Let her gather among the sheaves and don’t reprimand her. "
"7166","Ruth","2","16","Even pull out some stalks for her from the bundles and leave them for her to pick up, and don’t rebuke her.”"
"7167","Ruth","2","17","So Ruth gleaned in the field until evening. Then she threshed the barley she had gathered, and it amounted to about an ephah.2:17 That is, probably about 30 pounds or about 13 kilograms "
"7168","Ruth","2","18","She carried it back to town, and her mother-in-law saw how much she had gathered. Ruth also brought out and gave her what she had left over after she had eaten enough."
"7169","Ruth","2","19","Her mother-in-law asked her, “Where did you glean today? Where did you work? Blessed be the man who took notice of you!”Then Ruth told her mother-in-law about the one at whose place she had been working. “The name of the man I worked with today is Boaz,” she said. "
"7170","Ruth","2","20","""The Lord bless him!” Naomi said to her daughter-in-law. “He has not stopped showing his kindness to the living and the dead.” She added, “That man is our close relative; he is one of our guardian-redeemers.2:20 The Hebrew word for guardian-redeemer is a legal term for one who has the obligation to redeem a relative in serious difficulty (see Lev. 25:25-55).”"
"7171","Ruth","2","21","Then Ruth the Moabite said, “He even said to me, ‘Stay with my workers until they finish harvesting all my grain.’ ”"
"7172","Ruth","2","22","Naomi said to Ruth her daughter-in-law, “It will be good for you, my daughter, to go with the women who work for him, because in someone else’s field you might be harmed.”"
"7173","Ruth","2","23","So Ruth stayed close to the women of Boaz to glean until the barley and wheat harvests were finished. And she lived with her mother-in-law."
"7174","Ruth","3","1","One day Ruth’s mother-in-law Naomi said to her, “My daughter, I must find a home3:1 Hebrew find rest (see 1:9). for you, where you will be well provided for. "
"7175","Ruth","3","2","Now Boaz, with whose women you have worked, is a relative of ours. Tonight he will be winnowing barley on the threshing floor. "
"7176","Ruth","3","3","Wash, put on perfume, and get dressed in your best clothes. Then go down to the threshing floor, but don’t let him know you are there until he has finished eating and drinking. "
"7177","Ruth","3","4","When he lies down, note the place where he is lying. Then go and uncover his feet and lie down. He will tell you what to do.” "
"7178","Ruth","3","5","""I will do whatever you say,” Ruth answered. "
"7179","Ruth","3","6","So she went down to the threshing floor and did everything her mother-in-law told her to do."
"7180","Ruth","3","7","When Boaz had finished eating and drinking and was in good spirits, he went over to lie down at the far end of the grain pile. Ruth approached quietly, uncovered his feet and lay down. "
"7181","Ruth","3","8","In the middle of the night something startled the man; he turned—and there was a woman lying at his feet! "
"7182","Ruth","3","9","""Who are you?” he asked.“I am your servant Ruth,” she said. “Spread the corner of your garment over me, since you are a guardian-redeemer3:9 The Hebrew word for guardian-redeemer is a legal term for one who has the obligation to redeem a relative in serious difficulty (see Lev. 25:25-55); also in verses 12 and 13. of our family.” "
"7183","Ruth","3","10","""The Lord bless you, my daughter,” he replied. “This kindness is greater than that which you showed earlier: You have not run after the younger men, whether rich or poor. "
"7184","Ruth","3","11","And now, my daughter, don’t be afraid. I will do for you all you ask. All the people of my town know that you are a woman of noble character. "
"7185","Ruth","3","12","Although it is true that I am a guardian-redeemer of our family, there is another who is more closely related than I. "
"7186","Ruth","3","13","Stay here for the night, and in the morning if he wants to do his duty as your guardian-redeemer, good; let him redeem you. But if he is not willing, as surely as the Lord lives I will do it. Lie here until morning.”"
"7187","Ruth","3","14","So she lay at his feet until morning, but got up before anyone could be recognized; and he said, “No one must know that a woman came to the threshing floor.”"
"7188","Ruth","3","15","He also said, “Bring me the shawl you are wearing and hold it out.” When she did so, he poured into it six measures of barley and placed the bundle on her. Then he3:15 Most Hebrew manuscripts; many Hebrew manuscripts, Vulgate and Syriac she went back to town."
"7189","Ruth","3","16","When Ruth came to her mother-in-law, Naomi asked, “How did it go, my daughter?”Then she told her everything Boaz had done for her "
"7190","Ruth","3","17","and added, “He gave me these six measures of barley, saying, ‘Don’t go back to your mother-in-law empty-handed.’ ”"
"7191","Ruth","3","18","Then Naomi said, “Wait, my daughter, until you find out what happens. For the man will not rest until the matter is settled today.”"
"7192","Ruth","4","1","Meanwhile Boaz went up to the town gate and sat down there just as the guardian-redeemer4:1 The Hebrew word for guardian-redeemer is a legal term for one who has the obligation to redeem a relative in serious difficulty (see Lev. 25:25-55); also in verses 3, 6, 8 and 14. he had mentioned came along. Boaz said, “Come over here, my friend, and sit down.” So he went over and sat down."
"7193","Ruth","4","2","Boaz took ten of the elders of the town and said, “Sit here,” and they did so. "
"7194","Ruth","4","3","Then he said to the guardian-redeemer, “Naomi, who has come back from Moab, is selling the piece of land that belonged to our relative Elimelek. "
"7195","Ruth","4","4","I thought I should bring the matter to your attention and suggest that you buy it in the presence of these seated here and in the presence of the elders of my people. If you will redeem it, do so. But if you4:4 Many Hebrew manuscripts, Septuagint, Vulgate and Syriac; most Hebrew manuscripts he will not, tell me, so I will know. For no one has the right to do it except you, and I am next in line.”“I will redeem it,” he said."
"7196","Ruth","4","5","Then Boaz said, “On the day you buy the land from Naomi, you also acquire Ruth the Moabite, the4:5 Vulgate and Syriac; Hebrew (see also Septuagint) Naomi and from Ruth the Moabite, you acquire the dead man’s widow, in order to maintain the name of the dead with his property.”"
"7197","Ruth","4","6","At this, the guardian-redeemer said, “Then I cannot redeem it because I might endanger my own estate. You redeem it yourself. I cannot do it.”7(Now in earlier times in Israel, for the redemption and transfer of property to become final, one party took off his sandal and gave it to the other. This was the method of legalizing transactions in Israel.)"
"7198","Ruth","4","8","So the guardian-redeemer said to Boaz, “Buy it yourself.” And he removed his sandal."
"7199","Ruth","4","9","Then Boaz announced to the elders and all the people, “Today you are witnesses that I have bought from Naomi all the property of Elimelek, Kilion and Mahlon. "
"7200","Ruth","4","10","I have also acquired Ruth the Moabite, Mahlon’s widow, as my wife, in order to maintain the name of the dead with his property, so that his name will not disappear from among his family or from his hometown. Today you are witnesses!”"
"7201","Ruth","4","11","Then the elders and all the people at the gate said, “We are witnesses. May the Lord make the woman who is coming into your home like Rachel and Leah, who together built up the family of Israel. May you have standing in Ephrathah and be famous in Bethlehem. "
"7202","Ruth","4","12","Through the offspring the Lord gives you by this young woman, may your family be like that of Perez, whom Tamar bore to Judah.”Naomi Gains a Son"
"7203","Ruth","4","13","So Boaz took Ruth and she became his wife. When he made love to her, the Lord enabled her to conceive, and she gave birth to a son. "
"7204","Ruth","4","14","The women said to Naomi: “Praise be to the Lord, who this day has not left you without a guardian-redeemer. May he become famous throughout Israel! "
"7205","Ruth","4","15","He will renew your life and sustain you in your old age. For your daughter-in-law, who loves you and who is better to you than seven sons, has given him birth.”"
"7206","Ruth","4","16","Then Naomi took the child in her arms and cared for him. "
"7207","Ruth","4","17","The women living there said, “Naomi has a son!” And they named him Obed. He was the father of Jesse, the father of David.The Genealogy of David"

"7214","1-Samuel","1","2","He had two wives; one was called Hannah and the other Peninnah. Peninnah had children, but Hannah had none."
"7215","1-Samuel","1","3","Year after year this man went up from his town to worship and sacrifice to the Lord Almighty at Shiloh, where Hophni and Phinehas, the two sons of Eli, were priests of the Lord. "
"7216","1-Samuel","1","4","Whenever the day came for Elkanah to sacrifice, he would give portions of the meat to his wife Peninnah and to all her sons and daughters. "
"7217","1-Samuel","1","5","But to Hannah he gave a double portion because he loved her, and the Lord had closed her womb. "
"7218","1-Samuel","1","6","Because the Lord had closed Hannah’s womb, her rival kept provoking her in order to irritate her. "
"7219","1-Samuel","1","7","This went on year after year. Whenever Hannah went up to the house of the Lord, her rival provoked her till she wept and would not eat. "
"7220","1-Samuel","1","8","Her husband Elkanah would say to her, “Hannah, why are you weeping? Why don’t you eat? Why are you downhearted? Don’t I mean more to you than ten sons?”"
"7221","1-Samuel","1","9","Once when they had finished eating and drinking in Shiloh, Hannah stood up. Now Eli the priest was sitting on his chair by the doorpost of the Lord’s house. "
"7222","1-Samuel","1","10","In her deep anguish Hannah prayed to the Lord, weeping bitterly. "
"7223","1-Samuel","1","11","And she made a vow, saying, “Lord Almighty, if you will only look on your servant’s misery and remember me, and not forget your servant but give her a son, then I will give him to the Lord for all the days of his life, and no razor will ever be used on his head.”"
"7224","1-Samuel","1","12","As she kept on praying to the Lord, Eli observed her mouth. "
"7225","1-Samuel","1","13","Hannah was praying in her heart, and her lips were moving but her voice was not heard. Eli thought she was drunk "
"7226","1-Samuel","1","14","and said to her, “How long are you going to stay drunk? Put away your wine.” "
"7227","1-Samuel","1","15","""Not so, my lord,” Hannah replied, “I am a woman who is deeply troubled. I have not been drinking wine or beer; I was pouring out my soul to the Lord. "
"7228","1-Samuel","1","16","Do not take your servant for a wicked woman; I have been praying here out of my great anguish and grief.”"
"7229","1-Samuel","1","17","Eli answered, “Go in peace, and may the God of Israel grant you what you have asked of him.”"
"7230","1-Samuel","1","18","She said, “May your servant find favor in your eyes.” Then she went her way and ate something, and her face was no longer downcast."
"7231","1-Samuel","1","19","Early the next morning they arose and worshiped before the Lord and then went back to their home at Ramah. Elkanah made love to his wife Hannah, and the Lord remembered her. "

"7254","1-Samuel","2","14","and would plunge the fork into the pan or kettle or caldron or pot. Whatever the fork brought up the priest would take for himself. This is how they treated all the Israelites who came to Shiloh. "
"7255","1-Samuel","2","15","But even before the fat was burned, the priest’s servant would come and say to the person who was sacrificing, “Give the priest some meat to roast; he won’t accept boiled meat from you, but only raw.”"

"7260","1-Samuel","2","20","Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife, saying, “May the Lord give you children by this woman to take the place of the one she prayed for and gave to2:20 Dead Sea Scrolls; Masoretic Text and asked from the Lord.” Then they would go home. "
"7261","1-Samuel","2","21","And the Lord was gracious to Hannah; she gave birth to three sons and two daughters. Meanwhile, the boy Samuel grew up in the presence of the Lord."
"7262","1-Samuel","2","22","Now Eli, who was very old, heard about everything his sons were doing to all Israel and how they slept with the women who served at the entrance to the tent of meeting. "
"7263","1-Samuel","2","23","So he said to them, “Why do you do such things? I hear from all the people about these wicked deeds of yours. "
"7264","1-Samuel","2","24","No, my sons; the report I hear spreading among the Lord’s people is not good. "
"7265","1-Samuel","2","25","If one person sins against another, God2:25 Or the judges may mediate for the offender; but if anyone sins against the Lord, who will intercede for them?” His sons, however, did not listen to their father’s rebuke, for it was the Lord’s will to put them to death."
"7266","1-Samuel","2","26","And the boy Samuel continued to grow in stature and in favor with the Lord and with people.Prophecy Against the House of Eli"
"7267","1-Samuel","2","27","Now a man of God came to Eli and said to him, “This is what the Lord says: ‘Did I not clearly reveal myself to your ancestor’s family when they were in Egypt under Pharaoh? "
"7268","1-Samuel","2","28","I chose your ancestor out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to go up to my altar, to burn incense, and to wear an ephod in my presence. I also gave your ancestor’s family all the food offerings presented by the Israelites. "
"7269","1-Samuel","2","29","Why do you2:29 The Hebrew is plural. scorn my sacrifice and offering that I prescribed for my dwelling? Why do you honor your sons more than me by fattening yourselves on the choice parts of every offering made by my people Israel?’ "
"7270","1-Samuel","2","30","""Therefore the Lord, the God of Israel, declares: ‘I promised that members of your family would minister before me forever.’ But now the Lord declares: ‘Far be it from me! Those who honor me I will honor, but those who despise me will be disdained. "
"7271","1-Samuel","2","31","The time is coming when I will cut short your strength and the strength of your priestly house, so that no one in it will reach old age, "
"7272","1-Samuel","2","32","and you will see distress in my dwelling. Although good will be done to Israel, no one in your family line will ever reach old age. "
"7273","1-Samuel","2","33","Every one of you that I do not cut off from serving at my altar I will spare only to destroy your sight and sap your strength, and all your descendants will die in the prime of life. "
"7274","1-Samuel","2","34",""" ‘And what happens to your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, will be a sign to you—they will both die on the same day. "
"7275","1-Samuel","2","35","I will raise up for myself a faithful priest, who will do according to what is in my heart and mind. I will firmly establish his priestly house, and they will minister before my anointed one always. "
"7276","1-Samuel","2","36","Then everyone left in your family line will come and bow down before him for a piece of silver and a loaf of bread and plead, “Appoint me to some priestly office so I can have food to eat.” ’ ”"
"7277","1-Samuel","3","1","The boy Samuel ministered before the Lord under Eli. In those days the word of the Lord was rare; there were not many visions."
"7278","1-Samuel","3","2","One night Eli, whose eyes were becoming so weak that he could barely see, was lying down in his usual place. "
"7279","1-Samuel","3","3","The lamp of God had not yet gone out, and Samuel was lying down in the house of the Lord, where the ark of God was. "
"7280","1-Samuel","3","4","Then the Lord called Samuel.Samuel answered, “Here I am.” "
"7281","1-Samuel","3","5","And he ran to Eli and said, “Here I am; you called me.”But Eli said, “I did not call; go back and lie down.” So he went and lay down."
"7282","1-Samuel","3","6","Again the Lord called, “Samuel!” And Samuel got up and went to Eli and said, “Here I am; you called me.”“My son,” Eli said, “I did not call; go back and lie down.”"
"7283","1-Samuel","3","7","Now Samuel did not yet know the Lord: The word of the Lord had not yet been revealed to him."
"7284","1-Samuel","3","8","A third time the Lord called, “Samuel!” And Samuel got up and went to Eli and said, “Here I am; you called me.”Then Eli realized that the Lord was calling the boy. "
"7285","1-Samuel","3","9","So Eli told Samuel, “Go and lie down, and if he calls you, say, ‘Speak, Lord, for your servant is listening.’ ” So Samuel went and lay down in his place."
"7286","1-Samuel","3","10","The Lord came and stood there, calling as at the other times, “Samuel! Samuel!”Then Samuel said, “Speak, for your servant is listening.”"
"7287","1-Samuel","3","11","And the Lord said to Samuel: “See, I am about to do something in Israel that will make the ears of everyone who hears about it tingle. "
"7288","1-Samuel","3","12","At that time I will carry out against Eli everything I spoke against his family—from beginning to end. "
"7289","1-Samuel","3","13","For I told him that I would judge his family forever because of the sin he knew about; his sons blasphemed God,3:13 An ancient Hebrew scribal tradition (see also Septuagint); Masoretic Text sons made themselves contemptible and he failed to restrain them. "
"7290","1-Samuel","3","14","Therefore I swore to the house of Eli, ‘The guilt of Eli’s house will never be atoned for by sacrifice or offering.’ ”"
"7291","1-Samuel","3","15","Samuel lay down until morning and then opened the doors of the house of the Lord. He was afraid to tell Eli the vision, "
"7292","1-Samuel","3","16","but Eli called him and said, “Samuel, my son.”Samuel answered, “Here I am.” "
"7293","1-Samuel","3","17","""What was it he said to you?” Eli asked. “Do not hide it from me. May God deal with you, be it ever so severely, if you hide from me anything he told you.” "
"7294","1-Samuel","3","18","So Samuel told him everything, hiding nothing from him. Then Eli said, “He is the Lord; let him do what is good in his eyes.”"
"7295","1-Samuel","3","19","The Lord was with Samuel as he grew up, and he let none of Samuel’s words fall to the ground. "
"7296","1-Samuel","3","20","And all Israel from Dan to Beersheba recognized that Samuel was attested as a prophet of the Lord. "
"7297","1-Samuel","3","21","The Lord continued to appear at Shiloh, and there he revealed himself to Samuel through his word."
"7298","1-Samuel","4","1","And Samuel’s word came to all Israel.The Philistines Capture the ArkNow the Israelites went out to fight against the Philistines. The Israelites camped at Ebenezer, and the Philistines at Aphek. "
"7299","1-Samuel","4","2","The Philistines deployed their forces to meet Israel, and as the battle spread, Israel was defeated by the Philistines, who killed about four thousand of them on the battlefield. "
"7300","1-Samuel","4","3","When the soldiers returned to camp, the elders of Israel asked, “Why did the Lord bring defeat on us today before the Philistines? Let us bring the ark of the Lord’s covenant from Shiloh, so that he may go with us and save us from the hand of our enemies.”"
"7301","1-Samuel","4","4","So the people sent men to Shiloh, and they brought back the ark of the covenant of the Lord Almighty, who is enthroned between the cherubim. And Eli’s two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God."
"7302","1-Samuel","4","5","When the ark of the Lord’s covenant came into the camp, all Israel raised such a great shout that the ground shook. "
"7303","1-Samuel","4","6","Hearing the uproar, the Philistines asked, “What’s all this shouting in the Hebrew camp?”When they learned that the ark of the Lord had come into the camp, "
"7304","1-Samuel","4","7","the Philistines were afraid. “A god has4:7 Or “Gods have (see Septuagint) come into the camp,” they said. “Oh no! Nothing like this has happened before. "
"7305","1-Samuel","4","8","We’re doomed! Who will deliver us from the hand of these mighty gods? They are the gods who struck the Egyptians with all kinds of plagues in the wilderness. "
"7306","1-Samuel","4","9","Be strong, Philistines! Be men, or you will be subject to the Hebrews, as they have been to you. Be men, and fight!”"
"7307","1-Samuel","4","10","So the Philistines fought, and the Israelites were defeated and every man fled to his tent. The slaughter was very great; Israel lost thirty thousand foot soldiers. "
"7308","1-Samuel","4","11","The ark of God was captured, and Eli’s two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, died.Death of Eli"
"7309","1-Samuel","4","12","That same day a Benjamite ran from the battle line and went to Shiloh with his clothes torn and dust on his head. "
"7310","1-Samuel","4","13","When he arrived, there was Eli sitting on his chair by the side of the road, watching, because his heart feared for the ark of God. When the man entered the town and told what had happened, the whole town sent up a cry."
"7311","1-Samuel","4","14","Eli heard the outcry and asked, “What is the meaning of this uproar?”The man hurried over to Eli, "
"7312","1-Samuel","4","15","who was ninety-eight years old and whose eyes had failed so that he could not see. "
"7313","1-Samuel","4","16","He told Eli, “I have just come from the battle line; I fled from it this very day.”Eli asked, “What happened, my son?”"
"7314","1-Samuel","4","17","The man who brought the news replied, “Israel fled before the Philistines, and the army has suffered heavy losses. Also your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God has been captured.”"
"7315","1-Samuel","4","18","When he mentioned the ark of God, Eli fell backward off his chair by the side of the gate. His neck was broken and he died, for he was an old man, and he was heavy. He had led4:18 Traditionally judged Israel forty years."
"7316","1-Samuel","4","19","His daughter-in-law, the wife of Phinehas, was pregnant and near the time of delivery. When she heard the news that the ark of God had been captured and that her father-in-law and her husband were dead, she went into labor and gave birth, but was overcome by her labor pains. "
"7317","1-Samuel","4","20","As she was dying, the women attending her said, “Don’t despair; you have given birth to a son.” But she did not respond or pay any attention."
"7318","1-Samuel","4","21","She named the boy Ichabod,4:21 Ichabod means no glory. saying, “The Glory has departed from Israel”—because of the capture of the ark of God and the deaths of her father-in-law and her husband. "
"7319","1-Samuel","4","22","She said, “The Glory has departed from Israel, for the ark of God has been captured.”"
"7320","1-Samuel","5","1","After the Philistines had captured the ark of God, they took it from Ebenezer to Ashdod. "
"7321","1-Samuel","5","2","Then they carried the ark into Dagon’s temple and set it beside Dagon. "
"7322","1-Samuel","5","3","When the people of Ashdod rose early the next day, there was Dagon, fallen on his face on the ground before the ark of the Lord! They took Dagon and put him back in his place. "
"7323","1-Samuel","5","4","But the following morning when they rose, there was Dagon, fallen on his face on the ground before the ark of the Lord! His head and hands had been broken off and were lying on the threshold; only his body remained. "
"7324","1-Samuel","5","5","That is why to this day neither the priests of Dagon nor any others who enter Dagon’s temple at Ashdod step on the threshold."
"7325","1-Samuel","5","6","The Lord’s hand was heavy on the people of Ashdod and its vicinity; he brought devastation on them and afflicted them with tumors.5:6 Hebrew; Septuagint and Vulgate tumors. And rats appeared in their land, and there was death and destruction throughout the city "
"7326","1-Samuel","5","7","When the people of Ashdod saw what was happening, they said, “The ark of the god of Israel must not stay here with us, because his hand is heavy on us and on Dagon our god.” "
"7327","1-Samuel","5","8","So they called together all the rulers of the Philistines and asked them, “What shall we do with the ark of the god of Israel?”They answered, “Have the ark of the god of Israel moved to Gath.” So they moved the ark of the God of Israel."
"7328","1-Samuel","5","9","But after they had moved it, the Lord’s hand was against that city, throwing it into a great panic. He afflicted the people of the city, both young and old, with an outbreak of tumors.5:9 Or with tumors in the groin (see Septuagint) "
"7329","1-Samuel","5","10","So they sent the ark of God to Ekron.As the ark of God was entering Ekron, the people of Ekron cried out, “They have brought the ark of the god of Israel around to us to kill us and our people.” "
"7330","1-Samuel","5","11","So they called together all the rulers of the Philistines and said, “Send the ark of the god of Israel away; let it go back to its own place, or it5:11 Or he will kill us and our people.” For death had filled the city with panic; God’s hand was very heavy on it. "
"7331","1-Samuel","5","12","Those who did not die were afflicted with tumors, and the outcry of the city went up to heaven."
"7332","1-Samuel","6","1","When the ark of the Lord had been in Philistine territory seven months, "
"7333","1-Samuel","6","2","the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners and said, “What shall we do with the ark of the Lord? Tell us how we should send it back to its place.”"
"7334","1-Samuel","6","3","They answered, “If you return the ark of the god of Israel, do not send it back to him without a gift; by all means send a guilt offering to him. Then you will be healed, and you will know why his hand has not been lifted from you.”"
"7335","1-Samuel","6","4","The Philistines asked, “What guilt offering should we send to him?”They replied, “Five gold tumors and five gold rats, according to the number of the Philistine rulers, because the same plague has struck both you and your rulers. "
"7336","1-Samuel","6","5","Make models of the tumors and of the rats that are destroying the country, and give glory to Israel’s god. Perhaps he will lift his hand from you and your gods and your land. "
"7337","1-Samuel","6","6","Why do you harden your hearts as the Egyptians and Pharaoh did? When Israel’s god dealt harshly with them, did they not send the Israelites out so they could go on their way? "
"7338","1-Samuel","6","7","""Now then, get a new cart ready, with two cows that have calved and have never been yoked. Hitch the cows to the cart, but take their calves away and pen them up. "
"7339","1-Samuel","6","8","Take the ark of the Lord and put it on the cart, and in a chest beside it put the gold objects you are sending back to him as a guilt offering. Send it on its way, "
"7340","1-Samuel","6","9","but keep watching it. If it goes up to its own territory, toward Beth Shemesh, then the Lord has brought this great disaster on us. But if it does not, then we will know that it was not his hand that struck us but that it happened to us by chance.”"
"7341","1-Samuel","6","10","So they did this. They took two such cows and hitched them to the cart and penned up their calves. "
"7342","1-Samuel","6","11","They placed the ark of the Lord on the cart and along with it the chest containing the gold rats and the models of the tumors. "
"7343","1-Samuel","6","12","Then the cows went straight up toward Beth Shemesh, keeping on the road and lowing all the way; they did not turn to the right or to the left. The rulers of the Philistines followed them as far as the border of Beth Shemesh."
"7344","1-Samuel","6","13","Now the people of Beth Shemesh were harvesting their wheat in the valley, and when they looked up and saw the ark, they rejoiced at the sight. "
"7345","1-Samuel","6","14","The cart came to the field of Joshua of Beth Shemesh, and there it stopped beside a large rock. The people chopped up the wood of the cart and sacrificed the cows as a burnt offering to the Lord. "
"7346","1-Samuel","6","15","The Levites took down the ark of the Lord, together with the chest containing the gold objects, and placed them on the large rock. On that day the people of Beth Shemesh offered burnt offerings and made sacrifices to the Lord. "
"7347","1-Samuel","6","16","The five rulers of the Philistines saw all this and then returned that same day to Ekron."
"7348","1-Samuel","6","17","These are the gold tumors the Philistines sent as a guilt offering to the Lord—one each for Ashdod, Gaza, Ashkelon, Gath and Ekron. "
"7349","1-Samuel","6","18","And the number of the gold rats was according to the number of Philistine towns belonging to the five rulers—the fortified towns with their country villages. The large rock on which the Levites set the ark of the Lord is a witness to this day in the field of Joshua of Beth Shemesh."
"7350","1-Samuel","6","19","But God struck down some of the inhabitants of Beth Shemesh, putting seventy6:19 A few Hebrew manuscripts; most Hebrew manuscripts and Septuagint 50,070 of them to death because they looked into the ark of the Lord. The people mourned because of the heavy blow the Lord had dealt them. "
"7351","1-Samuel","6","20","And the people of Beth Shemesh asked, “Who can stand in the presence of the Lord, this holy God? To whom will the ark go up from here?”"
"7352","1-Samuel","6","21","Then they sent messengers to the people of Kiriath Jearim, saying, “The Philistines have returned the ark of the Lord. Come down and take it up to your town.”"
"7353","1-Samuel","7","1","So the men of Kiriath Jearim came and took up the ark of the Lord. They brought it to Abinadab’s house on the hill and consecrated Eleazar his son to guard the ark of the Lord. "
"7354","1-Samuel","7","2","The ark remained at Kiriath Jearim a long time—twenty years in all.Samuel Subdues the Philistines at MizpahThen all the people of Israel turned back to the Lord. "
"7355","1-Samuel","7","3","So Samuel said to all the Israelites, “If you are returning to the Lord with all your hearts, then rid yourselves of the foreign gods and the Ashtoreths and commit yourselves to the Lord and serve him only, and he will deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines.” "
"7356","1-Samuel","7","4","So the Israelites put away their Baals and Ashtoreths, and served the Lord only."
"7357","1-Samuel","7","5","Then Samuel said, “Assemble all Israel at Mizpah, and I will intercede with the Lord for you.” "
"7358","1-Samuel","7","6","When they had assembled at Mizpah, they drew water and poured it out before the Lord. On that day they fasted and there they confessed, “We have sinned against the Lord.” Now Samuel was serving as leader7:6 Traditionally judge; also in verse 15 of Israel at Mizpah."
"7359","1-Samuel","7","7","When the Philistines heard that Israel had assembled at Mizpah, the rulers of the Philistines came up to attack them. When the Israelites heard of it, they were afraid because of the Philistines. "
"7360","1-Samuel","7","8","They said to Samuel, “Do not stop crying out to the Lord our God for us, that he may rescue us from the hand of the Philistines.” "
"7361","1-Samuel","7","9","Then Samuel took a suckling lamb and sacrificed it as a whole burnt offering to the Lord. He cried out to the Lord on Israel’s behalf, and the Lord answered him."
"7362","1-Samuel","7","10","While Samuel was sacrificing the burnt offering, the Philistines drew near to engage Israel in battle. But that day the Lord thundered with loud thunder against the Philistines and threw them into such a panic that they were routed before the Israelites. "
"7363","1-Samuel","7","11","The men of Israel rushed out of Mizpah and pursued the Philistines, slaughtering them along the way to a point below Beth Kar."
"7364","1-Samuel","7","12","Then Samuel took a stone and set it up between Mizpah and Shen. He named it Ebenezer,7:12 Ebenezer means stone of help. saying, “Thus far the Lord has helped us.”"
"7365","1-Samuel","7","13","So the Philistines were subdued and they stopped invading Israel’s territory. Throughout Samuel’s lifetime, the hand of the Lord was against the Philistines. "
"7366","1-Samuel","7","14","The towns from Ekron to Gath that the Philistines had captured from Israel were restored to Israel, and Israel delivered the neighboring territory from the hands of the Philistines. And there was peace between Israel and the Amorites."
"7367","1-Samuel","7","15","Samuel continued as Israel’s leader all the days of his life. "
"7368","1-Samuel","7","16","From year to year he went on a circuit from Bethel to Gilgal to Mizpah, judging Israel in all those places. "
"7369","1-Samuel","7","17","But he always went back to Ramah, where his home was, and there he also held court for Israel. And he built an altar there to the Lord."
"7370","1-Samuel","8","1","When Samuel grew old, he appointed his sons as Israel’s leaders.8:1 Traditionally judges "
"7371","1-Samuel","8","2","The name of his firstborn was Joel and the name of his second was Abijah, and they served at Beersheba. "
"7372","1-Samuel","8","3","But his sons did not follow his ways. They turned aside after dishonest gain and accepted bribes and perverted justice."
"7373","1-Samuel","8","4","So all the elders of Israel gathered together and came to Samuel at Ramah. "
"7374","1-Samuel","8","5","They said to him, “You are old, and your sons do not follow your ways; now appoint a king to lead8:5 Traditionally judge; also in verses 6 and 20 us, such as all the other nations have.”"
"7375","1-Samuel","8","6","But when they said, “Give us a king to lead us,” this displeased Samuel; so he prayed to the Lord. "
"7376","1-Samuel","8","7","And the Lord told him: “Listen to all that the people are saying to you; it is not you they have rejected, but they have rejected me as their king. "
"7377","1-Samuel","8","8","As they have done from the day I brought them up out of Egypt until this day, forsaking me and serving other gods, so they are doing to you. "
"7378","1-Samuel","8","9","Now listen to them; but warn them solemnly and let them know what the king who will reign over them will claim as his rights.”"
"7379","1-Samuel","8","10","Samuel told all the words of the Lord to the people who were asking him for a king. "
"7380","1-Samuel","8","11","He said, “This is what the king who will reign over you will claim as his rights: He will take your sons and make them serve with his chariots and horses, and they will run in front of his chariots. "
"7381","1-Samuel","8","12","Some he will assign to be commanders of thousands and commanders of fifties, and others to plow his ground and reap his harvest, and still others to make weapons of war and equipment for his chariots. "
"7382","1-Samuel","8","13","He will take your daughters to be perfumers and cooks and bakers. "
"7383","1-Samuel","8","14","He will take the best of your fields and vineyards and olive groves and give them to his attendants. "
"7384","1-Samuel","8","15","He will take a tenth of your grain and of your vintage and give it to his officials and attendants. "
"7385","1-Samuel","8","16","Your male and female servants and the best of your cattle8:16 Septuagint; Hebrew young men and donkeys he will take for his own use. "

"7387","1-Samuel","8","18","When that day comes, you will cry out for relief from the king you have chosen, but the Lord will not answer you in that day.”"
"7388","1-Samuel","8","19","But the people refused to listen to Samuel. “No!” they said. “We want a king over us. "
"7389","1-Samuel","8","20","Then we will be like all the other nations, with a king to lead us and to go out before us and fight our battles.”"
"7390","1-Samuel","8","21","When Samuel heard all that the people said, he repeated it before the Lord. "
"7391","1-Samuel","8","22","The Lord answered, “Listen to them and give them a king.”Then Samuel said to the Israelites, “Everyone go back to your own town.”"
"7392","1-Samuel","9","1","There was a Benjamite, a man of standing, whose name was Kish son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Bekorath, the son of Aphiah of Benjamin. "
"7393","1-Samuel","9","2","Kish had a son named Saul, as handsome a young man as could be found anywhere in Israel, and he was a head taller than anyone else."
"7394","1-Samuel","9","3","Now the donkeys belonging to Saul’s father Kish were lost, and Kish said to his son Saul, “Take one of the servants with you and go and look for the donkeys.” "
"7395","1-Samuel","9","4","So he passed through the hill country of Ephraim and through the area around Shalisha, but they did not find them. They went on into the district of Shaalim, but the donkeys were not there. Then he passed through the territory of Benjamin, but they did not find them."

"7397","1-Samuel","9","6","But the servant replied, “Look, in this town there is a man of God; he is highly respected, and everything he says comes true. Let’s go there now. Perhaps he will tell us what way to take.”"
"7398","1-Samuel","9","7","Saul said to his servant, “If we go, what can we give the man? The food in our sacks is gone. We have no gift to take to the man of God. What do we have?”"
"7399","1-Samuel","9","8","The servant answered him again. “Look,” he said, “I have a quarter of a shekel9:8 That is, about 1/10 ounce or about 3 grams of silver. I will give it to the man of God so that he will tell us what way to take.” 9(Formerly in Israel, if someone went to inquire of God, they would say, “Come, let us go to the seer,” because the prophet of today used to be called a seer.) "
"7400","1-Samuel","9","10","""Good,” Saul said to his servant. “Come, let’s go.” So they set out for the town where the man of God was."
"7401","1-Samuel","9","11","As they were going up the hill to the town, they met some young women coming out to draw water, and they asked them, “Is the seer here?” "
"7402","1-Samuel","9","12","""He is,” they answered. “He’s ahead of you. Hurry now; he has just come to our town today, for the people have a sacrifice at the high place. "
"7403","1-Samuel","9","13","As soon as you enter the town, you will find him before he goes up to the high place to eat. The people will not begin eating until he comes, because he must bless the sacrifice; afterward, those who are invited will eat. Go up now; you should find him about this time.”"
"7404","1-Samuel","9","14","They went up to the town, and as they were entering it, there was Samuel, coming toward them on his way up to the high place."
"7405","1-Samuel","9","15","Now the day before Saul came, the Lord had revealed this to Samuel:  "
"7406","1-Samuel","9","16","""About this time tomorrow I will send you a man from the land of Benjamin. Anoint him ruler over my people Israel; he will deliver them from the hand of the Philistines. I have looked on my people, for their cry has reached me.”"
"7407","1-Samuel","9","17","When Samuel caught sight of Saul, the Lord said to him, “This is the man I spoke to you about; he will govern my people.”"
"7408","1-Samuel","9","18","Saul approached Samuel in the gateway and asked, “Would you please tell me where the seer’s house is?” "
"7409","1-Samuel","9","19","""I am the seer,” Samuel replied. “Go up ahead of me to the high place, for today you are to eat with me, and in the morning I will send you on your way and will tell you all that is in your heart. "
"7410","1-Samuel","9","20","As for the donkeys you lost three days ago, do not worry about them; they have been found. And to whom is all the desire of Israel turned, if not to you and your whole family line?”"
"7411","1-Samuel","9","21","Saul answered, “But am I not a Benjamite, from the smallest tribe of Israel, and is not my clan the least of all the clans of the tribe of Benjamin? Why do you say such a thing to me?”"
"7412","1-Samuel","9","22","Then Samuel brought Saul and his servant into the hall and seated them at the head of those who were invited—about thirty in number. "
"7413","1-Samuel","9","23","Samuel said to the cook, “Bring the piece of meat I gave you, the one I told you to lay aside.”"
"7414","1-Samuel","9","24","So the cook took up the thigh with what was on it and set it in front of Saul. Samuel said, “Here is what has been kept for you. Eat, because it was set aside for you for this occasion from the time I said, ‘I have invited guests.’ ” And Saul dined with Samuel that day."
"7415","1-Samuel","9","25","After they came down from the high place to the town, Samuel talked with Saul on the roof of his house. "
"7416","1-Samuel","9","26","They rose about daybreak, and Samuel called to Saul on the roof, “Get ready, and I will send you on your way.” When Saul got ready, he and Samuel went outside together. "
"7417","1-Samuel","9","27","As they were going down to the edge of the town, Samuel said to Saul, “Tell the servant to go on ahead of us”—and the servant did so—“but you stay here for a while, so that I may give you a message from God.”"
"7418","1-Samuel","10","1","Then Samuel took a flask of olive oil and poured it on Saul’s head and kissed him, saying, “Has not the Lord anointed you ruler over his inheritance?10:1 Hebrew; Septuagint and Vulgate over his people Israel? You will reign over the Lord’s people and save them from the power of their enemies round about. And this will be a sign to you that the Lord has anointed you ruler over his inheritance: "
"7419","1-Samuel","10","2","When you leave me today, you will meet two men near Rachel’s tomb, at Zelzah on the border of Benjamin. They will say to you, ‘The donkeys you set out to look for have been found. And now your father has stopped thinking about them and is worried about you. He is asking, “What shall I do about my son?” ’ "
"7420","1-Samuel","10","3","""Then you will go on from there until you reach the great tree of Tabor. Three men going up to worship God at Bethel will meet you there. One will be carrying three young goats, another three loaves of bread, and another a skin of wine. "
"7421","1-Samuel","10","4","They will greet you and offer you two loaves of bread, which you will accept from them. "
"7422","1-Samuel","10","5","""After that you will go to Gibeah of God, where there is a Philistine outpost. As you approach the town, you will meet a procession of prophets coming down from the high place with lyres, timbrels, pipes and harps being played before them, and they will be prophesying. "
"7423","1-Samuel","10","6","The Spirit of the Lord will come powerfully upon you, and you will prophesy with them; and you will be changed into a different person. "
"7424","1-Samuel","10","7","Once these signs are fulfilled, do whatever your hand finds to do, for God is with you. "
"7425","1-Samuel","10","8","""Go down ahead of me to Gilgal. I will surely come down to you to sacrifice burnt offerings and fellowship offerings, but you must wait seven days until I come to you and tell you what you are to do.”Saul Made King"
"7426","1-Samuel","10","9","As Saul turned to leave Samuel, God changed Saul’s heart, and all these signs were fulfilled that day. "
"7427","1-Samuel","10","10","When he and his servant arrived at Gibeah, a procession of prophets met him; the Spirit of God came powerfully upon him, and he joined in their prophesying. "
"7428","1-Samuel","10","11","When all those who had formerly known him saw him prophesying with the prophets, they asked each other, “What is this that has happened to the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?”"
"7429","1-Samuel","10","12","A man who lived there answered, “And who is their father?” So it became a saying: “Is Saul also among the prophets?” "
"7430","1-Samuel","10","13","After Saul stopped prophesying, he went to the high place."
"7431","1-Samuel","10","14","Now Saul’s uncle asked him and his servant, “Where have you been?”“Looking for the donkeys,” he said. “But when we saw they were not to be found, we went to Samuel.”"
"7432","1-Samuel","10","15","Saul’s uncle said, “Tell me what Samuel said to you.”"
"7433","1-Samuel","10","16","Saul replied, “He assured us that the donkeys had been found.” But he did not tell his uncle what Samuel had said about the kingship."
"7434","1-Samuel","10","17","Samuel summoned the people of Israel to the Lord at Mizpah "
"7435","1-Samuel","10","18","and said to them, “This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: ‘I brought Israel up out of Egypt, and I delivered you from the power of Egypt and all the kingdoms that oppressed you.’ "
"7436","1-Samuel","10","19","But you have now rejected your God, who saves you out of all your disasters and calamities. And you have said, ‘No, appoint a king over us.’ So now present yourselves before the Lord by your tribes and clans.”"
"7437","1-Samuel","10","20","When Samuel had all Israel come forward by tribes, the tribe of Benjamin was taken by lot. "
"7438","1-Samuel","10","21","Then he brought forward the tribe of Benjamin, clan by clan, and Matri’s clan was taken. Finally Saul son of Kish was taken. But when they looked for him, he was not to be found. "
"7439","1-Samuel","10","22","So they inquired further of the Lord, “Has the man come here yet?”And the Lord said, “Yes, he has hidden himself among the supplies.”"
"7440","1-Samuel","10","23","They ran and brought him out, and as he stood among the people he was a head taller than any of the others. "
"7441","1-Samuel","10","24","Samuel said to all the people, “Do you see the man the Lord has chosen? There is no one like him among all the people.”Then the people shouted, “Long live the king!”"
"7442","1-Samuel","10","25","Samuel explained to the people the rights and duties of kingship. He wrote them down on a scroll and deposited it before the Lord. Then Samuel dismissed the people to go to their own homes."
"7443","1-Samuel","10","26","Saul also went to his home in Gibeah, accompanied by valiant men whose hearts God had touched. "
"7444","1-Samuel","10","27","But some scoundrels said, “How can this fellow save us?” They despised him and brought him no gifts. But Saul kept silent."
"7445","1-Samuel","11","1","Nahash11:1 Masoretic Text; Dead Sea Scrolls gifts. Now Nahash king of the Ammonites oppressed the Gadites and Reubenites severely. He gouged out all their right eyes and struck terror and dread in Israel. Not a man remained among the Israelites beyond the Jordan whose right eye was not gouged out by Nahash king of the Ammonites, except that seven thousand men fled from the Ammonites and entered Jabesh Gilead. About a month later, 1 Nahash the Ammonite went up and besieged Jabesh Gilead. And all the men of Jabesh said to him, “Make a treaty with us, and we will be subject to you.”"
"7446","1-Samuel","11","2","But Nahash the Ammonite replied, “I will make a treaty with you only on the condition that I gouge out the right eye of every one of you and so bring disgrace on all Israel.”"
"7447","1-Samuel","11","3","The elders of Jabesh said to him, “Give us seven days so we can send messengers throughout Israel; if no one comes to rescue us, we will surrender to you.”"
"7448","1-Samuel","11","4","When the messengers came to Gibeah of Saul and reported these terms to the people, they all wept aloud. "
"7449","1-Samuel","11","5","Just then Saul was returning from the fields, behind his oxen, and he asked, “What is wrong with everyone? Why are they weeping?” Then they repeated to him what the men of Jabesh had said."
"7450","1-Samuel","11","6","When Saul heard their words, the Spirit of God came powerfully upon him, and he burned with anger. "
"7451","1-Samuel","11","7","He took a pair of oxen, cut them into pieces, and sent the pieces by messengers throughout Israel, proclaiming, “This is what will be done to the oxen of anyone who does not follow Saul and Samuel.” Then the terror of the Lord fell on the people, and they came out together as one. "
"7452","1-Samuel","11","8","When Saul mustered them at Bezek, the men of Israel numbered three hundred thousand and those of Judah thirty thousand."
"7453","1-Samuel","11","9","They told the messengers who had come, “Say to the men of Jabesh Gilead, ‘By the time the sun is hot tomorrow, you will be rescued.’ ” When the messengers went and reported this to the men of Jabesh, they were elated. "
"7454","1-Samuel","11","10","They said to the Ammonites, “Tomorrow we will surrender to you, and you can do to us whatever you like.”"
"7455","1-Samuel","11","11","The next day Saul separated his men into three divisions; during the last watch of the night they broke into the camp of the Ammonites and slaughtered them until the heat of the day. Those who survived were scattered, so that no two of them were left together.Saul Confirmed as King"
"7456","1-Samuel","11","12","The people then said to Samuel, “Who was it that asked, ‘Shall Saul reign over us?’ Turn these men over to us so that we may put them to death.”"
"7457","1-Samuel","11","13","But Saul said, “No one will be put to death today, for this day the Lord has rescued Israel.”"
"7458","1-Samuel","11","14","Then Samuel said to the people, “Come, let us go to Gilgal and there renew the kingship.” "
"7459","1-Samuel","11","15","So all the people went to Gilgal and made Saul king in the presence of the Lord. There they sacrificed fellowship offerings before the Lord, and Saul and all the Israelites held a great celebration."
"7460","1-Samuel","12","1","Samuel said to all Israel, “I have listened to everything you said to me and have set a king over you. "
"7461","1-Samuel","12","2","Now you have a king as your leader. As for me, I am old and gray, and my sons are here with you. I have been your leader from my youth until this day. "
"7462","1-Samuel","12","3","Here I stand. Testify against me in the presence of the Lord and his anointed. Whose ox have I taken? Whose donkey have I taken? Whom have I cheated? Whom have I oppressed? From whose hand have I accepted a bribe to make me shut my eyes? If I have done any of these things, I will make it right.” "
"7463","1-Samuel","12","4","""You have not cheated or oppressed us,” they replied. “You have not taken anything from anyone’s hand.”"
"7464","1-Samuel","12","5","Samuel said to them, “The Lord is witness against you, and also his anointed is witness this day, that you have not found anything in my hand.”“He is witness,” they said."
"7465","1-Samuel","12","6","Then Samuel said to the people, “It is the Lord who appointed Moses and Aaron and brought your ancestors up out of Egypt. "
"7466","1-Samuel","12","7","Now then, stand here, because I am going to confront you with evidence before the Lord as to all the righteous acts performed by the Lord for you and your ancestors. "
"7467","1-Samuel","12","8","""After Jacob entered Egypt, they cried to the Lord for help, and the Lord sent Moses and Aaron, who brought your ancestors out of Egypt and settled them in this place. "
"7468","1-Samuel","12","9","""But they forgot the Lord their God; so he sold them into the hand of Sisera, the commander of the army of Hazor, and into the hands of the Philistines and the king of Moab, who fought against them. "
"7469","1-Samuel","12","10","They cried out to the Lord and said, ‘We have sinned; we have forsaken the Lord and served the Baals and the Ashtoreths. But now deliver us from the hands of our enemies, and we will serve you.’ "
"7470","1-Samuel","12","11","Then the Lord sent Jerub-Baal,12:11 Also called Gideon Barak,12:11 Some Septuagint manuscripts and Syriac; Hebrew Bedan Jephthah and Samuel,12:11 Hebrew; some Septuagint manuscripts and Syriac Samson and he delivered you from the hands of your enemies all around you, so that you lived in safety. "
"7471","1-Samuel","12","12","""But when you saw that Nahash king of the Ammonites was moving against you, you said to me, ‘No, we want a king to rule over us’—even though the Lord your God was your king. "
"7472","1-Samuel","12","13","Now here is the king you have chosen, the one you asked for; see, the Lord has set a king over you. "
"7473","1-Samuel","12","14","If you fear the Lord and serve and obey him and do not rebel against his commands, and if both you and the king who reigns over you follow the Lord your God—good! "
"7474","1-Samuel","12","15","But if you do not obey the Lord, and if you rebel against his commands, his hand will be against you, as it was against your ancestors. "
"7475","1-Samuel","12","16","""Now then, stand still and see this great thing the Lord is about to do before your eyes! "
"7476","1-Samuel","12","17","Is it not wheat harvest now? I will call on the Lord to send thunder and rain. And you will realize what an evil thing you did in the eyes of the Lord when you asked for a king.”"
"7477","1-Samuel","12","18","Then Samuel called on the Lord, and that same day the Lord sent thunder and rain. So all the people stood in awe of the Lord and of Samuel."
"7478","1-Samuel","12","19","The people all said to Samuel, “Pray to the Lord your God for your servants so that we will not die, for we have added to all our other sins the evil of asking for a king.” "
"7479","1-Samuel","12","20","""Do not be afraid,” Samuel replied. “You have done all this evil; yet do not turn away from the Lord, but serve the Lord with all your heart. "
"7480","1-Samuel","12","21","Do not turn away after useless idols. They can do you no good, nor can they rescue you, because they are useless. "
"7481","1-Samuel","12","22","For the sake of his great name the Lord will not reject his people, because the Lord was pleased to make you his own. "
"7482","1-Samuel","12","23","As for me, far be it from me that I should sin against the Lord by failing to pray for you. And I will teach you the way that is good and right. "
"7483","1-Samuel","12","24","But be sure to fear the Lord and serve him faithfully with all your heart; consider what great things he has done for you. "
"7484","1-Samuel","12","25","Yet if you persist in doing evil, both you and your king will perish.”"
"7485","1-Samuel","13","1","Saul was thirty13:1 A few late manuscripts of the Septuagint; Hebrew does not have thirty. years old when he became king, and he reigned over Israel forty-13:1 Probable reading of the original Hebrew text (see Acts 13:21); Masoretic Text does not have forty-. two years."
"7486","1-Samuel","13","2","Saul chose three thousand men from Israel; two thousand were with him at Mikmash and in the hill country of Bethel, and a thousand were with Jonathan at Gibeah in Benjamin. The rest of the men he sent back to their homes."
"7487","1-Samuel","13","3","Jonathan attacked the Philistine outpost at Geba, and the Philistines heard about it. Then Saul had the trumpet blown throughout the land and said, “Let the Hebrews hear!” "
"7488","1-Samuel","13","4","So all Israel heard the news: “Saul has attacked the Philistine outpost, and now Israel has become obnoxious to the Philistines.” And the people were summoned to join Saul at Gilgal."
"7489","1-Samuel","13","5","The Philistines assembled to fight Israel, with three thousand13:5 Some Septuagint manuscripts and Syriac; Hebrew thirty thousand chariots, six thousand charioteers, and soldiers as numerous as the sand on the seashore. They went up and camped at Mikmash, east of Beth Aven. "
"7490","1-Samuel","13","6","When the Israelites saw that their situation was critical and that their army was hard pressed, they hid in caves and thickets, among the rocks, and in pits and cisterns. "
"7491","1-Samuel","13","7","Some Hebrews even crossed the Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead.Saul remained at Gilgal, and all the troops with him were quaking with fear. "
"7492","1-Samuel","13","8","He waited seven days, the time set by Samuel; but Samuel did not come to Gilgal, and Saul’s men began to scatter. "
"7493","1-Samuel","13","9","So he said, “Bring me the burnt offering and the fellowship offerings.” And Saul offered up the burnt offering. "
"7494","1-Samuel","13","10","Just as he finished making the offering, Samuel arrived, and Saul went out to greet him. "
"7495","1-Samuel","13","11","""What have you done?” asked Samuel.Saul replied, “When I saw that the men were scattering, and that you did not come at the set time, and that the Philistines were assembling at Mikmash, "
"7496","1-Samuel","13","12","I thought, ‘Now the Philistines will come down against me at Gilgal, and I have not sought the Lord’s favor.’ So I felt compelled to offer the burnt offering.” "
"7497","1-Samuel","13","13","""You have done a foolish thing,” Samuel said. “You have not kept the command the Lord your God gave you; if you had, he would have established your kingdom over Israel for all time. "
"7498","1-Samuel","13","14","But now your kingdom will not endure; the Lord has sought out a man after his own heart and appointed him ruler of his people, because you have not kept the Lord’s command.”"
"7499","1-Samuel","13","15","Then Samuel left Gilgal13:15 Hebrew; Septuagint Gilgal and went his way; the rest of the people went after Saul to meet the army, and they went out of Gilgal and went up to Gibeah in Benjamin, and Saul counted the men who were with him. They numbered about six hundred.Israel Without Weapons"
"7500","1-Samuel","13","16","Saul and his son Jonathan and the men with them were staying in Gibeah13:16 Two Hebrew manuscripts; most Hebrew manuscripts Geba, a variant of Gibeah in Benjamin, while the Philistines camped at Mikmash. "
"7501","1-Samuel","13","17","Raiding parties went out from the Philistine camp in three detachments. One turned toward Ophrah in the vicinity of Shual, "
"7502","1-Samuel","13","18","another toward Beth Horon, and the third toward the borderland overlooking the Valley of Zeboyim facing the wilderness."
"7503","1-Samuel","13","19","Not a blacksmith could be found in the whole land of Israel, because the Philistines had said, “Otherwise the Hebrews will make swords or spears!” "
"7504","1-Samuel","13","20","So all Israel went down to the Philistines to have their plow points, mattocks, axes and sickles13:20 Septuagint; Hebrew plow points sharpened. "
"7505","1-Samuel","13","21","The price was two-thirds of a shekel13:21 That is, about 1/4 ounce or about 8 grams for sharpening plow points and mattocks, and a third of a shekel13:21 That is, about 1/8 ounce or about 4 grams for sharpening forks and axes and for repointing goads."
"7506","1-Samuel","13","22","So on the day of the battle not a soldier with Saul and Jonathan had a sword or spear in his hand; only Saul and his son Jonathan had them.Jonathan Attacks the Philistines"
"7507","1-Samuel","13","23","Now a detachment of Philistines had gone out to the pass at Mikmash."
"7508","1-Samuel","14","1","One day Jonathan son of Saul said to his young armor-bearer, “Come, let’s go over to the Philistine outpost on the other side.” But he did not tell his father."
"7509","1-Samuel","14","2","Saul was staying on the outskirts of Gibeah under a pomegranate tree in Migron. With him were about six hundred men, "
"7510","1-Samuel","14","3","among whom was Ahijah, who was wearing an ephod. He was a son of Ichabod’s brother Ahitub son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the Lord’s priest in Shiloh. No one was aware that Jonathan had left."
"7511","1-Samuel","14","4","On each side of the pass that Jonathan intended to cross to reach the Philistine outpost was a cliff; one was called Bozez and the other Seneh. "
"7512","1-Samuel","14","5","One cliff stood to the north toward Mikmash, the other to the south toward Geba."
"7513","1-Samuel","14","6","Jonathan said to his young armor-bearer, “Come, let’s go over to the outpost of those uncircumcised men. Perhaps the Lord will act in our behalf. Nothing can hinder the Lord from saving, whether by many or by few.” "
"7514","1-Samuel","14","7","""Do all that you have in mind,” his armor-bearer said. “Go ahead; I am with you heart and soul.”"
"7515","1-Samuel","14","8","Jonathan said, “Come on, then; we will cross over toward them and let them see us. "
"7516","1-Samuel","14","9","If they say to us, ‘Wait there until we come to you,’ we will stay where we are and not go up to them. "
"7517","1-Samuel","14","10","But if they say, ‘Come up to us,’ we will climb up, because that will be our sign that the Lord has given them into our hands.”"
"7518","1-Samuel","14","11","So both of them showed themselves to the Philistine outpost. “Look!” said the Philistines. “The Hebrews are crawling out of the holes they were hiding in.” "
"7519","1-Samuel","14","12","The men of the outpost shouted to Jonathan and his armor-bearer, “Come up to us and we’ll teach you a lesson.”So Jonathan said to his armor-bearer, “Climb up after me; the Lord has given them into the hand of Israel.”"
"7520","1-Samuel","14","13","Jonathan climbed up, using his hands and feet, with his armor-bearer right behind him. The Philistines fell before Jonathan, and his armor-bearer followed and killed behind him. "
"7521","1-Samuel","14","14","In that first attack Jonathan and his armor-bearer killed some twenty men in an area of about half an acre.Israel Routs the Philistines"
"7522","1-Samuel","14","15","Then panic struck the whole army—those in the camp and field, and those in the outposts and raiding parties—and the ground shook. It was a panic sent by God.14:15 Or a terrible panic"
"7523","1-Samuel","14","16","Saul’s lookouts at Gibeah in Benjamin saw the army melting away in all directions. "
"7524","1-Samuel","14","17","Then Saul said to the men who were with him, “Muster the forces and see who has left us.” When they did, it was Jonathan and his armor-bearer who were not there."
"7525","1-Samuel","14","18","Saul said to Ahijah, “Bring the ark of God.” (At that time it was with the Israelites.)14:18 Hebrew; Septuagint “Bring the ephod.” (At that time he wore the ephod before the Israelites.) "
"7526","1-Samuel","14","19","While Saul was talking to the priest, the tumult in the Philistine camp increased more and more. So Saul said to the priest, “Withdraw your hand.”"
"7527","1-Samuel","14","20","Then Saul and all his men assembled and went to the battle. They found the Philistines in total confusion, striking each other with their swords. "
"7528","1-Samuel","14","21","Those Hebrews who had previously been with the Philistines and had gone up with them to their camp went over to the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan. "
"7529","1-Samuel","14","22","When all the Israelites who had hidden in the hill country of Ephraim heard that the Philistines were on the run, they joined the battle in hot pursuit. "
"7530","1-Samuel","14","23","So on that day the Lord saved Israel, and the battle moved on beyond Beth Aven.Jonathan Eats Honey"
"7531","1-Samuel","14","24","Now the Israelites were in distress that day, because Saul had bound the people under an oath, saying, “Cursed be anyone who eats food before evening comes, before I have avenged myself on my enemies!” So none of the troops tasted food."
"7532","1-Samuel","14","25","The entire army entered the woods, and there was honey on the ground. "
"7533","1-Samuel","14","26","When they went into the woods, they saw the honey oozing out; yet no one put his hand to his mouth, because they feared the oath. "
"7534","1-Samuel","14","27","But Jonathan had not heard that his father had bound the people with the oath, so he reached out the end of the staff that was in his hand and dipped it into the honeycomb. He raised his hand to his mouth, and his eyes brightened.14:27 Or his strength was renewed; similarly in verse 29 "
"7535","1-Samuel","14","28","Then one of the soldiers told him, “Your father bound the army under a strict oath, saying, ‘Cursed be anyone who eats food today!’ That is why the men are faint.”"
"7536","1-Samuel","14","29","Jonathan said, “My father has made trouble for the country. See how my eyes brightened when I tasted a little of this honey. "
"7537","1-Samuel","14","30","How much better it would have been if the men had eaten today some of the plunder they took from their enemies. Would not the slaughter of the Philistines have been even greater?”"
"7538","1-Samuel","14","31","That day, after the Israelites had struck down the Philistines from Mikmash to Aijalon, they were exhausted. "
"7539","1-Samuel","14","32","They pounced on the plunder and, taking sheep, cattle and calves, they butchered them on the ground and ate them, together with the blood. "
"7540","1-Samuel","14","33","Then someone said to Saul, “Look, the men are sinning against the Lord by eating meat that has blood in it.”“You have broken faith,” he said. “Roll a large stone over here at once.” "
"7541","1-Samuel","14","34","Then he said, “Go out among the men and tell them, ‘Each of you bring me your cattle and sheep, and slaughter them here and eat them. Do not sin against the Lord by eating meat with blood still in it.’ ”So everyone brought his ox that night and slaughtered it there. "
"7542","1-Samuel","14","35","Then Saul built an altar to the Lord; it was the first time he had done this."
"7543","1-Samuel","14","36","Saul said, “Let us go down and pursue the Philistines by night and plunder them till dawn, and let us not leave one of them alive.”“Do whatever seems best to you,” they replied.But the priest said, “Let us inquire of God here.”"
"7544","1-Samuel","14","37","So Saul asked God, “Shall I go down and pursue the Philistines? Will you give them into Israel’s hand?” But God did not answer him that day."
"7545","1-Samuel","14","38","Saul therefore said, “Come here, all you who are leaders of the army, and let us find out what sin has been committed today. "
"7546","1-Samuel","14","39","As surely as the Lord who rescues Israel lives, even if the guilt lies with my son Jonathan, he must die.” But not one of them said a word."
"7547","1-Samuel","14","40","Saul then said to all the Israelites, “You stand over there; I and Jonathan my son will stand over here.”“Do what seems best to you,” they replied."
"7548","1-Samuel","14","41","Then Saul prayed to the Lord, the God of Israel, “Why have you not answered your servant today? If the fault is in me or my son Jonathan, respond with Urim, but if the men of Israel are at fault,14:41 Septuagint; Hebrew does not have “Why… at fault. respond with Thummim.” Jonathan and Saul were taken by lot, and the men were cleared. "
"7549","1-Samuel","14","42","Saul said, “Cast the lot between me and Jonathan my son.” And Jonathan was taken."
"7550","1-Samuel","14","43","Then Saul said to Jonathan, “Tell me what you have done.”So Jonathan told him, “I tasted a little honey with the end of my staff. And now I must die!”"
"7551","1-Samuel","14","44","Saul said, “May God deal with me, be it ever so severely, if you do not die, Jonathan.”"
"7552","1-Samuel","14","45","But the men said to Saul, “Should Jonathan die—he who has brought about this great deliverance in Israel? Never! As surely as the Lord lives, not a hair of his head will fall to the ground, for he did this today with God’s help.” So the men rescued Jonathan, and he was not put to death."
"7553","1-Samuel","14","46","Then Saul stopped pursuing the Philistines, and they withdrew to their own land."
"7554","1-Samuel","14","47","After Saul had assumed rule over Israel, he fought against their enemies on every side: Moab, the Ammonites, Edom, the kings14:47 Masoretic Text; Dead Sea Scrolls and Septuagint king of Zobah, and the Philistines. Wherever he turned, he inflicted punishment on them.14:47 Hebrew; Septuagint he was victorious "
"7555","1-Samuel","14","48","He fought valiantly and defeated the Amalekites, delivering Israel from the hands of those who had plundered them.Saul’s Family"
"7556","1-Samuel","14","49","Saul’s sons were Jonathan, Ishvi and Malki-Shua. The name of his older daughter was Merab, and that of the younger was Michal. "
"7557","1-Samuel","14","50","His wife’s name was Ahinoam daughter of Ahimaaz. The name of the commander of Saul’s army was Abner son of Ner, and Ner was Saul’s uncle. "
"7558","1-Samuel","14","51","Saul’s father Kish and Abner’s father Ner were sons of Abiel."
"7559","1-Samuel","14","52","All the days of Saul there was bitter war with the Philistines, and whenever Saul saw a mighty or brave man, he took him into his service."
"7560","1-Samuel","15","1","Samuel said to Saul, “I am the one the Lord sent to anoint you king over his people Israel; so listen now to the message from the Lord. "
"7561","1-Samuel","15","2","This is what the Lord Almighty says: ‘I will punish the Amalekites for what they did to Israel when they waylaid them as they came up from Egypt. "
"7562","1-Samuel","15","3","Now go, attack the Amalekites and totally destroy15:3 The Hebrew term refers to the irrevocable giving over of things or persons to the Lord, often by totally destroying them; also in verses 8, 9, 15, 18, 20 and 21. all that belongs to them. Do not spare them; put to death men and women, children and infants, cattle and sheep, camels and donkeys.’ ”"
"7563","1-Samuel","15","4","So Saul summoned the men and mustered them at Telaim—two hundred thousand foot soldiers and ten thousand from Judah. "
"7564","1-Samuel","15","5","Saul went to the city of Amalek and set an ambush in the ravine. "
"7565","1-Samuel","15","6","Then he said to the Kenites, “Go away, leave the Amalekites so that I do not destroy you along with them; for you showed kindness to all the Israelites when they came up out of Egypt.” So the Kenites moved away from the Amalekites."
"7566","1-Samuel","15","7","Then Saul attacked the Amalekites all the way from Havilah to Shur, near the eastern border of Egypt. "
"7567","1-Samuel","15","8","He took Agag king of the Amalekites alive, and all his people he totally destroyed with the sword. "
"7568","1-Samuel","15","9","But Saul and the army spared Agag and the best of the sheep and cattle, the fat calves15:9 Or the grown bulls; the meaning of the Hebrew for this phrase is uncertain. and lambs—everything that was good. These they were unwilling to destroy completely, but everything that was despised and weak they totally destroyed."
"7569","1-Samuel","15","10","Then the word of the Lord came to Samuel:  "
"7570","1-Samuel","15","11","""I regret that I have made Saul king, because he has turned away from me and has not carried out my instructions.” Samuel was angry, and he cried out to the Lord all that night."
"7571","1-Samuel","15","12","Early in the morning Samuel got up and went to meet Saul, but he was told, “Saul has gone to Carmel. There he has set up a monument in his own honor and has turned and gone on down to Gilgal.”"
"7572","1-Samuel","15","13","When Samuel reached him, Saul said, “The Lord bless you! I have carried out the Lord’s instructions.”"
"7573","1-Samuel","15","14","But Samuel said, “What then is this bleating of sheep in my ears? What is this lowing of cattle that I hear?”"
"7574","1-Samuel","15","15","Saul answered, “The soldiers brought them from the Amalekites; they spared the best of the sheep and cattle to sacrifice to the Lord your God, but we totally destroyed the rest.” "
"7575","1-Samuel","15","16","""Enough!” Samuel said to Saul. “Let me tell you what the Lord said to me last night.”“Tell me,” Saul replied."
"7576","1-Samuel","15","17","Samuel said, “Although you were once small in your own eyes, did you not become the head of the tribes of Israel? The Lord anointed you king over Israel. "
"7577","1-Samuel","15","18","And he sent you on a mission, saying, ‘Go and completely destroy those wicked people, the Amalekites; wage war against them until you have wiped them out.’ "
"7578","1-Samuel","15","19","Why did you not obey the Lord? Why did you pounce on the plunder and do evil in the eyes of the Lord?” "
"7579","1-Samuel","15","20","""But I did obey the Lord,” Saul said. “I went on the mission the Lord assigned me. I completely destroyed the Amalekites and brought back Agag their king. "
"7580","1-Samuel","15","21","The soldiers took sheep and cattle from the plunder, the best of what was devoted to God, in order to sacrifice them to the Lord your God at Gilgal.”"
"7581","1-Samuel","15","22","But Samuel replied:“Does the Lord delight in burnt offerings and sacrificesas much as in obeying the Lord?To obey is better than sacrifice,and to heed is better than the fat of rams."
"7582","1-Samuel","15","23","For rebellion is like the sin of divination,and arrogance like the evil of idolatry.Because you have rejected the word of the Lord,he has rejected you as king.”"
"7583","1-Samuel","15","24","Then Saul said to Samuel, “I have sinned. I violated the Lord’s command and your instructions. I was afraid of the men and so I gave in to them. "
"7584","1-Samuel","15","25","Now I beg you, forgive my sin and come back with me, so that I may worship the Lord.”"
"7585","1-Samuel","15","26","But Samuel said to him, “I will not go back with you. You have rejected the word of the Lord, and the Lord has rejected you as king over Israel!”"
"7586","1-Samuel","15","27","As Samuel turned to leave, Saul caught hold of the hem of his robe, and it tore. "
"7587","1-Samuel","15","28","Samuel said to him, “The Lord has torn the kingdom of Israel from you today and has given it to one of your neighbors—to one better than you. "
"7588","1-Samuel","15","29","He who is the Glory of Israel does not lie or change his mind; for he is not a human being, that he should change his mind.”"
"7589","1-Samuel","15","30","Saul replied, “I have sinned. But please honor me before the elders of my people and before Israel; come back with me, so that I may worship the Lord your God.” "
"7590","1-Samuel","15","31","So Samuel went back with Saul, and Saul worshiped the Lord."
"7591","1-Samuel","15","32","Then Samuel said, “Bring me Agag king of the Amalekites.”Agag came to him in chains.15:32 The meaning of the Hebrew for this phrase is uncertain. And he thought, “Surely the bitterness of death is past.”"
"7592","1-Samuel","15","33","But Samuel said,“As your sword has made women childless,so will your mother be childless among women.”And Samuel put Agag to death before the Lord at Gilgal."
"7593","1-Samuel","15","34","Then Samuel left for Ramah, but Saul went up to his home in Gibeah of Saul. "
"7594","1-Samuel","15","35","Until the day Samuel died, he did not go to see Saul again, though Samuel mourned for him. And the Lord regretted that he had made Saul king over Israel."
"7595","1-Samuel","16","1","The Lord said to Samuel, “How long will you mourn for Saul, since I have rejected him as king over Israel? Fill your horn with oil and be on your way; I am sending you to Jesse of Bethlehem. I have chosen one of his sons to be king.”"
"7596","1-Samuel","16","2","But Samuel said, “How can I go? If Saul hears about it, he will kill me.”The Lord said, “Take a heifer with you and say, ‘I have come to sacrifice to the Lord.’ "
"7597","1-Samuel","16","3","Invite Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show you what to do. You are to anoint for me the one I indicate.”"
"7598","1-Samuel","16","4","Samuel did what the Lord said. When he arrived at Bethlehem, the elders of the town trembled when they met him. They asked, “Do you come in peace?”"
"7599","1-Samuel","16","5","Samuel replied, “Yes, in peace; I have come to sacrifice to the Lord. Consecrate yourselves and come to the sacrifice with me.” Then he consecrated Jesse and his sons and invited them to the sacrifice."
"7600","1-Samuel","16","6","When they arrived, Samuel saw Eliab and thought, “Surely the Lord’s anointed stands here before the Lord.”"
"7601","1-Samuel","16","7","But the Lord said to Samuel, “Do not consider his appearance or his height, for I have rejected him. The Lord does not look at the things people look at. People look at the outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart.”"
"7602","1-Samuel","16","8","Then Jesse called Abinadab and had him pass in front of Samuel. But Samuel said, “The Lord has not chosen this one either.” "
"7603","1-Samuel","16","9","Jesse then had Shammah pass by, but Samuel said, “Nor has the Lord chosen this one.” "
"7604","1-Samuel","16","10","Jesse had seven of his sons pass before Samuel, but Samuel said to him, “The Lord has not chosen these.” "
"7605","1-Samuel","16","11","So he asked Jesse, “Are these all the sons you have?”“There is still the youngest,” Jesse answered. “He is tending the sheep.”Samuel said, “Send for him; we will not sit down until he arrives.”"
"7606","1-Samuel","16","12","So he sent for him and had him brought in. He was glowing with health and had a fine appearance and handsome features.Then the Lord said, “Rise and anoint him; this is the one.”"
"7607","1-Samuel","16","13","So Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the presence of his brothers, and from that day on the Spirit of the Lord came powerfully upon David. Samuel then went to Ramah.David in Saul’s Service"
"7608","1-Samuel","16","14","Now the Spirit of the Lord had departed from Saul, and an evil16:14 Or and a harmful; similarly in verses 15, 16 and 23 spirit from the Lord tormented him."
"7609","1-Samuel","16","15","Saul’s attendants said to him, “See, an evil spirit from God is tormenting you. "
"7610","1-Samuel","16","16","Let our lord command his servants here to search for someone who can play the lyre. He will play when the evil spirit from God comes on you, and you will feel better.”"
"7611","1-Samuel","16","17","So Saul said to his attendants, “Find someone who plays well and bring him to me.”"
"7612","1-Samuel","16","18","One of the servants answered, “I have seen a son of Jesse of Bethlehem who knows how to play the lyre. He is a brave man and a warrior. He speaks well and is a fine-looking man. And the Lord is with him.”"
"7613","1-Samuel","16","19","Then Saul sent messengers to Jesse and said, “Send me your son David, who is with the sheep.” "
"7614","1-Samuel","16","20","So Jesse took a donkey loaded with bread, a skin of wine and a young goat and sent them with his son David to Saul."
"7615","1-Samuel","16","21","David came to Saul and entered his service. Saul liked him very much, and David became one of his armor-bearers. "
"7616","1-Samuel","16","22","Then Saul sent word to Jesse, saying, “Allow David to remain in my service, for I am pleased with him.”"
"7617","1-Samuel","16","23","Whenever the spirit from God came on Saul, David would take up his lyre and play. Then relief would come to Saul; he would feel better, and the evil spirit would leave him."
"7618","1-Samuel","17","1","Now the Philistines gathered their forces for war and assembled at Sokoh in Judah. They pitched camp at Ephes Dammim, between Sokoh and Azekah. "
"7619","1-Samuel","17","2","Saul and the Israelites assembled and camped in the Valley of Elah and drew up their battle line to meet the Philistines. "
"7620","1-Samuel","17","3","The Philistines occupied one hill and the Israelites another, with the valley between them."
"7621","1-Samuel","17","4","A champion named Goliath, who was from Gath, came out of the Philistine camp. His height was six cubits and a span.17:4 That is, about 9 feet 9 inches or about 3 meters "
"7622","1-Samuel","17","5","He had a bronze helmet on his head and wore a coat of scale armor of bronze weighing five thousand shekels17:5 That is, about 125 pounds or about 58 kilograms; "
"7623","1-Samuel","17","6","on his legs he wore bronze greaves, and a bronze javelin was slung on his back. "
"7624","1-Samuel","17","7","His spear shaft was like a weaver’s rod, and its iron point weighed six hundred shekels.17:7 That is, about 15 pounds or about 6.9 kilograms His shield bearer went ahead of him."
"7625","1-Samuel","17","8","Goliath stood and shouted to the ranks of Israel, “Why do you come out and line up for battle? Am I not a Philistine, and are you not the servants of Saul? Choose a man and have him come down to me. "
"7626","1-Samuel","17","9","If he is able to fight and kill me, we will become your subjects; but if I overcome him and kill him, you will become our subjects and serve us.” "
"7627","1-Samuel","17","10","Then the Philistine said, “This day I defy the armies of Israel! Give me a man and let us fight each other.” "
"7628","1-Samuel","17","11","On hearing the Philistine’s words, Saul and all the Israelites were dismayed and terrified."
"7629","1-Samuel","17","12","Now David was the son of an Ephrathite named Jesse, who was from Bethlehem in Judah. Jesse had eight sons, and in Saul’s time he was very old. "
"7630","1-Samuel","17","13","Jesse’s three oldest sons had followed Saul to the war: The firstborn was Eliab; the second, Abinadab; and the third, Shammah. "
"7631","1-Samuel","17","14","David was the youngest. The three oldest followed Saul, "
"7632","1-Samuel","17","15","but David went back and forth from Saul to tend his father’s sheep at Bethlehem."
"7633","1-Samuel","17","16","For forty days the Philistine came forward every morning and evening and took his stand."
"7634","1-Samuel","17","17","Now Jesse said to his son David, “Take this ephah17:17 That is, probably about 36 pounds or about 16 kilograms of roasted grain and these ten loaves of bread for your brothers and hurry to their camp. "
"7635","1-Samuel","17","18","Take along these ten cheeses to the commander of their unit. See how your brothers are and bring back some assurance17:18 Or some token; or some pledge of spoils from them. "
"7636","1-Samuel","17","19","They are with Saul and all the men of Israel in the Valley of Elah, fighting against the Philistines.”"
"7637","1-Samuel","17","20","Early in the morning David left the flock in the care of a shepherd, loaded up and set out, as Jesse had directed. He reached the camp as the army was going out to its battle positions, shouting the war cry. "
"7638","1-Samuel","17","21","Israel and the Philistines were drawing up their lines facing each other. "
"7639","1-Samuel","17","22","David left his things with the keeper of supplies, ran to the battle lines and asked his brothers how they were. "
"7640","1-Samuel","17","23","As he was talking with them, Goliath, the Philistine champion from Gath, stepped out from his lines and shouted his usual defiance, and David heard it. "
"7641","1-Samuel","17","24","Whenever the Israelites saw the man, they all fled from him in great fear."
"7642","1-Samuel","17","25","Now the Israelites had been saying, “Do you see how this man keeps coming out? He comes out to defy Israel. The king will give great wealth to the man who kills him. He will also give him his daughter in marriage and will exempt his family from taxes in Israel.”"
"7643","1-Samuel","17","26","David asked the men standing near him, “What will be done for the man who kills this Philistine and removes this disgrace from Israel? Who is this uncircumcised Philistine that he should defy the armies of the living God?”"
"7644","1-Samuel","17","27","They repeated to him what they had been saying and told him, “This is what will be done for the man who kills him.”"
"7645","1-Samuel","17","28","When Eliab, David’s oldest brother, heard him speaking with the men, he burned with anger at him and asked, “Why have you come down here? And with whom did you leave those few sheep in the wilderness? I know how conceited you are and how wicked your heart is; you came down only to watch the battle.” "
"7646","1-Samuel","17","29","""Now what have I done?” said David. “Can’t I even speak?” "
"7647","1-Samuel","17","30","He then turned away to someone else and brought up the same matter, and the men answered him as before. "
"7648","1-Samuel","17","31","What David said was overheard and reported to Saul, and Saul sent for him."
"7649","1-Samuel","17","32","David said to Saul, “Let no one lose heart on account of this Philistine; your servant will go and fight him.”"
"7650","1-Samuel","17","33","Saul replied, “You are not able to go out against this Philistine and fight him; you are only a young man, and he has been a warrior from his youth.”"
"7651","1-Samuel","17","34","But David said to Saul, “Your servant has been keeping his father’s sheep. When a lion or a bear came and carried off a sheep from the flock, "
"7652","1-Samuel","17","35","I went after it, struck it and rescued the sheep from its mouth. When it turned on me, I seized it by its hair, struck it and killed it. "
"7653","1-Samuel","17","36","Your servant has killed both the lion and the bear; this uncircumcised Philistine will be like one of them, because he has defied the armies of the living God. "
"7654","1-Samuel","17","37","The Lord who rescued me from the paw of the lion and the paw of the bear will rescue me from the hand of this Philistine.”Saul said to David, “Go, and the Lord be with you.”"
"7655","1-Samuel","17","38","Then Saul dressed David in his own tunic. He put a coat of armor on him and a bronze helmet on his head. "
"7656","1-Samuel","17","39","David fastened on his sword over the tunic and tried walking around, because he was not used to them.“I cannot go in these,” he said to Saul, “because I am not used to them.” So he took them off. "
"7657","1-Samuel","17","40","Then he took his staff in his hand, chose five smooth stones from the stream, put them in the pouch of his shepherd’s bag and, with his sling in his hand, approached the Philistine."
"7658","1-Samuel","17","41","Meanwhile, the Philistine, with his shield bearer in front of him, kept coming closer to David. "
"7659","1-Samuel","17","42","He looked David over and saw that he was little more than a boy, glowing with health and handsome, and he despised him. "
"7660","1-Samuel","17","43","He said to David, “Am I a dog, that you come at me with sticks?” And the Philistine cursed David by his gods.  "
"7661","1-Samuel","17","44","""Come here,” he said, “and I’ll give your flesh to the birds and the wild animals!”"
"7662","1-Samuel","17","45","David said to the Philistine, “You come against me with sword and spear and javelin, but I come against you in the name of the Lord Almighty, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied. "
"7663","1-Samuel","17","46","This day the Lord will deliver you into my hands, and I’ll strike you down and cut off your head. This very day I will give the carcasses of the Philistine army to the birds and the wild animals, and the whole world will know that there is a God in Israel. "
"7664","1-Samuel","17","47","All those gathered here will know that it is not by sword or spear that the Lord saves; for the battle is the Lord’s, and he will give all of you into our hands.”"
"7665","1-Samuel","17","48","As the Philistine moved closer to attack him, David ran quickly toward the battle line to meet him. "
"7666","1-Samuel","17","49","Reaching into his bag and taking out a stone, he slung it and struck the Philistine on the forehead. The stone sank into his forehead, and he fell facedown on the ground."
"7667","1-Samuel","17","50","So David triumphed over the Philistine with a sling and a stone; without a sword in his hand he struck down the Philistine and killed him."
"7668","1-Samuel","17","51","David ran and stood over him. He took hold of the Philistine’s sword and drew it from the sheath. After he killed him, he cut off his head with the sword.When the Philistines saw that their hero was dead, they turned and ran. "
"7669","1-Samuel","17","52","Then the men of Israel and Judah surged forward with a shout and pursued the Philistines to the entrance of Gath17:52 Some Septuagint manuscripts; Hebrew of a valley and to the gates of Ekron. Their dead were strewn along the Shaaraim road to Gath and Ekron. "
"7670","1-Samuel","17","53","When the Israelites returned from chasing the Philistines, they plundered their camp."
"7671","1-Samuel","17","54","David took the Philistine’s head and brought it to Jerusalem; he put the Philistine’s weapons in his own tent."
"7672","1-Samuel","17","55","As Saul watched David going out to meet the Philistine, he said to Abner, commander of the army, “Abner, whose son is that young man?”Abner replied, “As surely as you live, Your Majesty, I don’t know.”"
"7673","1-Samuel","17","56","The king said, “Find out whose son this young man is.”"
"7674","1-Samuel","17","57","As soon as David returned from killing the Philistine, Abner took him and brought him before Saul, with David still holding the Philistine’s head. "
"7675","1-Samuel","17","58","""Whose son are you, young man?” Saul asked him.David said, “I am the son of your servant Jesse of Bethlehem.”"
"7676","1-Samuel","18","1","After David had finished talking with Saul, Jonathan became one in spirit with David, and he loved him as himself. "
"7677","1-Samuel","18","2","From that day Saul kept David with him and did not let him return home to his family. "
"7678","1-Samuel","18","3","And Jonathan made a covenant with David because he loved him as himself. "
"7679","1-Samuel","18","4","Jonathan took off the robe he was wearing and gave it to David, along with his tunic, and even his sword, his bow and his belt."
"7680","1-Samuel","18","5","Whatever mission Saul sent him on, David was so successful that Saul gave him a high rank in the army. This pleased all the troops, and Saul’s officers as well."
"7681","1-Samuel","18","6","When the men were returning home after David had killed the Philistine, the women came out from all the towns of Israel to meet King Saul with singing and dancing, with joyful songs and with timbrels and lyres. "
"7682","1-Samuel","18","7","As they danced, they sang:“Saul has slain his thousands,and David his tens of thousands.”"
"7683","1-Samuel","18","8","Saul was very angry; this refrain displeased him greatly. “They have credited David with tens of thousands,” he thought, “but me with only thousands. What more can he get but the kingdom?” "
"7684","1-Samuel","18","9","And from that time on Saul kept a close eye on David."
"7685","1-Samuel","18","10","The next day an evil18:10 Or a harmful spirit from God came forcefully on Saul. He was prophesying in his house, while David was playing the lyre, as he usually did. Saul had a spear in his hand "
"7686","1-Samuel","18","11","and he hurled it, saying to himself, “I’ll pin David to the wall.” But David eluded him twice."
"7687","1-Samuel","18","12","Saul was afraid of David, because the Lord was with David but had departed from Saul. "
"7688","1-Samuel","18","13","So he sent David away from him and gave him command over a thousand men, and David led the troops in their campaigns. "
"7689","1-Samuel","18","14","In everything he did he had great success, because the Lord was with him. "
"7690","1-Samuel","18","15","When Saul saw how successful he was, he was afraid of him. "
"7691","1-Samuel","18","16","But all Israel and Judah loved David, because he led them in their campaigns."
"7692","1-Samuel","18","17","Saul said to David, “Here is my older daughter Merab. I will give her to you in marriage; only serve me bravely and fight the battles of the Lord.” For Saul said to himself, “I will not raise a hand against him. Let the Philistines do that!”"
"7693","1-Samuel","18","18","But David said to Saul, “Who am I, and what is my family or my clan in Israel, that I should become the king’s son-in-law?” "
"7694","1-Samuel","18","19","So18:19 Or However, when the time came for Merab, Saul’s daughter, to be given to David, she was given in marriage to Adriel of Meholah."
"7695","1-Samuel","18","20","Now Saul’s daughter Michal was in love with David, and when they told Saul about it, he was pleased.  "
"7696","1-Samuel","18","21","""I will give her to him,” he thought, “so that she may be a snare to him and so that the hand of the Philistines may be against him.” So Saul said to David, “Now you have a second opportunity to become my son-in-law.”"
"7697","1-Samuel","18","22","Then Saul ordered his attendants: “Speak to David privately and say, ‘Look, the king likes you, and his attendants all love you; now become his son-in-law.’ ”"
"7698","1-Samuel","18","23","They repeated these words to David. But David said, “Do you think it is a small matter to become the king’s son-in-law? I’m only a poor man and little known.”"
"7699","1-Samuel","18","24","When Saul’s servants told him what David had said, "
"7700","1-Samuel","18","25","Saul replied, “Say to David, ‘The king wants no other price for the bride than a hundred Philistine foreskins, to take revenge on his enemies.’ ” Saul’s plan was to have David fall by the hands of the Philistines."
"7701","1-Samuel","18","26","When the attendants told David these things, he was pleased to become the king’s son-in-law. So before the allotted time elapsed, "
"7702","1-Samuel","18","27","David took his men with him and went out and killed two hundred Philistines and brought back their foreskins. They counted out the full number to the king so that David might become the king’s son-in-law. Then Saul gave him his daughter Michal in marriage."
"7703","1-Samuel","18","28","When Saul realized that the Lord was with David and that his daughter Michal loved David, "
"7704","1-Samuel","18","29","Saul became still more afraid of him, and he remained his enemy the rest of his days."
"7705","1-Samuel","18","30","The Philistine commanders continued to go out to battle, and as often as they did, David met with more success than the rest of Saul’s officers, and his name became well known."
"7706","1-Samuel","19","1","Saul told his son Jonathan and all the attendants to kill David. But Jonathan had taken a great liking to David "
"7707","1-Samuel","19","2","and warned him, “My father Saul is looking for a chance to kill you. Be on your guard tomorrow morning; go into hiding and stay there. "
"7708","1-Samuel","19","3","I will go out and stand with my father in the field where you are. I’ll speak to him about you and will tell you what I find out.”"
"7709","1-Samuel","19","4","Jonathan spoke well of David to Saul his father and said to him, “Let not the king do wrong to his servant David; he has not wronged you, and what he has done has benefited you greatly. "
"7710","1-Samuel","19","5","He took his life in his hands when he killed the Philistine. The Lord won a great victory for all Israel, and you saw it and were glad. Why then would you do wrong to an innocent man like David by killing him for no reason?”"
"7711","1-Samuel","19","6","Saul listened to Jonathan and took this oath: “As surely as the Lord lives, David will not be put to death.”"
"7712","1-Samuel","19","7","So Jonathan called David and told him the whole conversation. He brought him to Saul, and David was with Saul as before."
"7713","1-Samuel","19","8","Once more war broke out, and David went out and fought the Philistines. He struck them with such force that they fled before him."
"7714","1-Samuel","19","9","But an evil19:9 Or But a harmful spirit from the Lord came on Saul as he was sitting in his house with his spear in his hand. While David was playing the lyre, "
"7715","1-Samuel","19","10","Saul tried to pin him to the wall with his spear, but David eluded him as Saul drove the spear into the wall. That night David made good his escape."
"7716","1-Samuel","19","11","Saul sent men to David’s house to watch it and to kill him in the morning. But Michal, David’s wife, warned him, “If you don’t run for your life tonight, tomorrow you’ll be killed.” "
"7717","1-Samuel","19","12","So Michal let David down through a window, and he fled and escaped. "
"7718","1-Samuel","19","13","Then Michal took an idol and laid it on the bed, covering it with a garment and putting some goats’ hair at the head."
"7719","1-Samuel","19","14","When Saul sent the men to capture David, Michal said, “He is ill.”"
"7720","1-Samuel","19","15","Then Saul sent the men back to see David and told them, “Bring him up to me in his bed so that I may kill him.” "
"7721","1-Samuel","19","16","But when the men entered, there was the idol in the bed, and at the head was some goats’ hair."
"7722","1-Samuel","19","17","Saul said to Michal, “Why did you deceive me like this and send my enemy away so that he escaped?”Michal told him, “He said to me, ‘Let me get away. Why should I kill you?’ ”"
"7723","1-Samuel","19","18","When David had fled and made his escape, he went to Samuel at Ramah and told him all that Saul had done to him. Then he and Samuel went to Naioth and stayed there. "
"7724","1-Samuel","19","19","Word came to Saul: “David is in Naioth at Ramah”; "
"7725","1-Samuel","19","20","so he sent men to capture him. But when they saw a group of prophets prophesying, with Samuel standing there as their leader, the Spirit of God came on Saul’s men, and they also prophesied. "
"7726","1-Samuel","19","21","Saul was told about it, and he sent more men, and they prophesied too. Saul sent men a third time, and they also prophesied. "
"7727","1-Samuel","19","22","Finally, he himself left for Ramah and went to the great cistern at Seku. And he asked, “Where are Samuel and David?”“Over in Naioth at Ramah,” they said."
"7728","1-Samuel","19","23","So Saul went to Naioth at Ramah. But the Spirit of God came even on him, and he walked along prophesying until he came to Naioth. "
"7729","1-Samuel","19","24","He stripped off his garments, and he too prophesied in Samuel’s presence. He lay naked all that day and all that night. This is why people say, “Is Saul also among the prophets?”"
"7730","1-Samuel","20","1","Then David fled from Naioth at Ramah and went to Jonathan and asked, “What have I done? What is my crime? How have I wronged your father, that he is trying to kill me?” "
"7731","1-Samuel","20","2","""Never!” Jonathan replied. “You are not going to die! Look, my father doesn’t do anything, great or small, without letting me know. Why would he hide this from me? It isn’t so!”"
"7732","1-Samuel","20","3","But David took an oath and said, “Your father knows very well that I have found favor in your eyes, and he has said to himself, ‘Jonathan must not know this or he will be grieved.’ Yet as surely as the Lord lives and as you live, there is only a step between me and death.”"
"7733","1-Samuel","20","4","Jonathan said to David, “Whatever you want me to do, I’ll do for you.”"
"7734","1-Samuel","20","5","So David said, “Look, tomorrow is the New Moon feast, and I am supposed to dine with the king; but let me go and hide in the field until the evening of the day after tomorrow. "
"7735","1-Samuel","20","6","If your father misses me at all, tell him, ‘David earnestly asked my permission to hurry to Bethlehem, his hometown, because an annual sacrifice is being made there for his whole clan.’ "
"7736","1-Samuel","20","7","If he says, ‘Very well,’ then your servant is safe. But if he loses his temper, you can be sure that he is determined to harm me. "
"7737","1-Samuel","20","8","As for you, show kindness to your servant, for you have brought him into a covenant with you before the Lord. If I am guilty, then kill me yourself! Why hand me over to your father?” "
"7738","1-Samuel","20","9","""Never!” Jonathan said. “If I had the least inkling that my father was determined to harm you, wouldn’t I tell you?”"
"7739","1-Samuel","20","10","David asked, “Who will tell me if your father answers you harshly?” "
"7740","1-Samuel","20","11","""Come,” Jonathan said, “let’s go out into the field.” So they went there together."
"7741","1-Samuel","20","12","Then Jonathan said to David, “I swear by the Lord, the God of Israel, that I will surely sound out my father by this time the day after tomorrow! If he is favorably disposed toward you, will I not send you word and let you know? "
"7742","1-Samuel","20","13","But if my father intends to harm you, may the Lord deal with Jonathan, be it ever so severely, if I do not let you know and send you away in peace. May the Lord be with you as he has been with my father. "
"7743","1-Samuel","20","14","But show me unfailing kindness like the Lord’s kindness as long as I live, so that I may not be killed, "
"7744","1-Samuel","20","15","and do not ever cut off your kindness from my family—not even when the Lord has cut off every one of David’s enemies from the face of the earth.”"
"7745","1-Samuel","20","16","So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, “May the Lord call David’s enemies to account.” "
"7746","1-Samuel","20","17","And Jonathan had David reaffirm his oath out of love for him, because he loved him as he loved himself."
"7747","1-Samuel","20","18","Then Jonathan said to David, “Tomorrow is the New Moon feast. You will be missed, because your seat will be empty. "
"7748","1-Samuel","20","19","The day after tomorrow, toward evening, go to the place where you hid when this trouble began, and wait by the stone Ezel. "
"7749","1-Samuel","20","20","I will shoot three arrows to the side of it, as though I were shooting at a target. "
"7750","1-Samuel","20","21","Then I will send a boy and say, ‘Go, find the arrows.’ If I say to him, ‘Look, the arrows are on this side of you; bring them here,’ then come, because, as surely as the Lord lives, you are safe; there is no danger. "
"7751","1-Samuel","20","22","But if I say to the boy, ‘Look, the arrows are beyond you,’ then you must go, because the Lord has sent you away. "
"7752","1-Samuel","20","23","And about the matter you and I discussed—remember, the Lord is witness between you and me forever.”"
"7753","1-Samuel","20","24","So David hid in the field, and when the New Moon feast came, the king sat down to eat. "
"7754","1-Samuel","20","25","He sat in his customary place by the wall, opposite Jonathan,20:25 Septuagint; Hebrew wall. Jonathan arose and Abner sat next to Saul, but David’s place was empty. "
"7755","1-Samuel","20","26","Saul said nothing that day, for he thought, “Something must have happened to David to make him ceremonially unclean—surely he is unclean.” "
"7756","1-Samuel","20","27","But the next day, the second day of the month, David’s place was empty again. Then Saul said to his son Jonathan, “Why hasn’t the son of Jesse come to the meal, either yesterday or today?”"
"7757","1-Samuel","20","28","Jonathan answered, “David earnestly asked me for permission to go to Bethlehem. "
"7758","1-Samuel","20","29","He said, ‘Let me go, because our family is observing a sacrifice in the town and my brother has ordered me to be there. If I have found favor in your eyes, let me get away to see my brothers.’ That is why he has not come to the king’s table.”"
"7759","1-Samuel","20","30","Saul’s anger flared up at Jonathan and he said to him, “You son of a perverse and rebellious woman! Don’t I know that you have sided with the son of Jesse to your own shame and to the shame of the mother who bore you? "
"7760","1-Samuel","20","31","As long as the son of Jesse lives on this earth, neither you nor your kingdom will be established. Now send someone to bring him to me, for he must die!” "
"7761","1-Samuel","20","32","""Why should he be put to death? What has he done?” Jonathan asked his father. "
"7762","1-Samuel","20","33","But Saul hurled his spear at him to kill him. Then Jonathan knew that his father intended to kill David."
"7763","1-Samuel","20","34","Jonathan got up from the table in fierce anger; on that second day of the feast he did not eat, because he was grieved at his father’s shameful treatment of David."
"7764","1-Samuel","20","35","In the morning Jonathan went out to the field for his meeting with David. He had a small boy with him, "
"7765","1-Samuel","20","36","and he said to the boy, “Run and find the arrows I shoot.” As the boy ran, he shot an arrow beyond him. "
"7766","1-Samuel","20","37","When the boy came to the place where Jonathan’s arrow had fallen, Jonathan called out after him, “Isn’t the arrow beyond you?” "
"7767","1-Samuel","20","38","Then he shouted, “Hurry! Go quickly! Don’t stop!” The boy picked up the arrow and returned to his master. 39(The boy knew nothing about all this; only Jonathan and David knew.) "
"7768","1-Samuel","20","40","Then Jonathan gave his weapons to the boy and said, “Go, carry them back to town.”"
"7769","1-Samuel","20","41","After the boy had gone, David got up from the south side of the stone and bowed down before Jonathan three times, with his face to the ground. Then they kissed each other and wept together—but David wept the most."
"7770","1-Samuel","20","42","Jonathan said to David, “Go in peace, for we have sworn friendship with each other in the name of the Lord, saying, ‘The Lord is witness between you and me, and between your descendants and my descendants forever.’ ” Then David left, and Jonathan went back to the town.20:42 In Hebrew texts this sentence (20:"
"7771","1-Samuel","20","42","b) is numbered 21:1."
"7772","1-Samuel","21","1","David went to Nob, to Ahimelek the priest. Ahimelek trembled when he met him, and asked, “Why are you alone? Why is no one with you?”"
"7773","1-Samuel","21","2","David answered Ahimelek the priest, “The king sent me on a mission and said to me, ‘No one is to know anything about the mission I am sending you on.’ As for my men, I have told them to meet me at a certain place. "
"7774","1-Samuel","21","3","Now then, what do you have on hand? Give me five loaves of bread, or whatever you can find.”"
"7775","1-Samuel","21","4","But the priest answered David, “I don’t have any ordinary bread on hand; however, there is some consecrated bread here—provided the men have kept themselves from women.”"
"7776","1-Samuel","21","5","David replied, “Indeed women have been kept from us, as usual whenever21:5 Or from us in the past few days since I set out. The men’s bodies are holy even on missions that are not holy. How much more so today!” "
"7777","1-Samuel","21","6","So the priest gave him the consecrated bread, since there was no bread there except the bread of the Presence that had been removed from before the Lord and replaced by hot bread on the day it was taken away."
"7778","1-Samuel","21","7","Now one of Saul’s servants was there that day, detained before the Lord; he was Doeg the Edomite, Saul’s chief shepherd."
"7779","1-Samuel","21","8","David asked Ahimelek, “Don’t you have a spear or a sword here? I haven’t brought my sword or any other weapon, because the king’s mission was urgent.”"
"7780","1-Samuel","21","9","The priest replied, “The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you killed in the Valley of Elah, is here; it is wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod. If you want it, take it; there is no sword here but that one.”David said, “There is none like it; give it to me.”David at Gath"
"7781","1-Samuel","21","10","That day David fled from Saul and went to Achish king of Gath. "
"7782","1-Samuel","21","11","But the servants of Achish said to him, “Isn’t this David, the king of the land? Isn’t he the one they sing about in their dances:“ ‘Saul has slain his thousands,and David his tens of thousands’?”"
"7783","1-Samuel","21","12","David took these words to heart and was very much afraid of Achish king of Gath. "
"7784","1-Samuel","21","13","So he pretended to be insane in their presence; and while he was in their hands he acted like a madman, making marks on the doors of the gate and letting saliva run down his beard."
"7785","1-Samuel","21","14","Achish said to his servants, “Look at the man! He is insane! Why bring him to me? "
"7786","1-Samuel","21","15","Am I so short of madmen that you have to bring this fellow here to carry on like this in front of me? Must this man come into my house?”"
"7787","1-Samuel","22","1","David left Gath and escaped to the cave of Adullam. When his brothers and his father’s household heard about it, they went down to him there. "
"7788","1-Samuel","22","2","All those who were in distress or in debt or discontented gathered around him, and he became their commander. About four hundred men were with him."
"7789","1-Samuel","22","3","From there David went to Mizpah in Moab and said to the king of Moab, “Would you let my father and mother come and stay with you until I learn what God will do for me?” "
"7790","1-Samuel","22","4","So he left them with the king of Moab, and they stayed with him as long as David was in the stronghold."
"7791","1-Samuel","22","5","But the prophet Gad said to David, “Do not stay in the stronghold. Go into the land of Judah.” So David left and went to the forest of Hereth.Saul Kills the Priests of Nob"
"7792","1-Samuel","22","6","Now Saul heard that David and his men had been discovered. And Saul was seated, spear in hand, under the tamarisk tree on the hill at Gibeah, with all his officials standing at his side. "
"7793","1-Samuel","22","7","He said to them, “Listen, men of Benjamin! Will the son of Jesse give all of you fields and vineyards? Will he make all of you commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds? "
"7794","1-Samuel","22","8","Is that why you have all conspired against me? No one tells me when my son makes a covenant with the son of Jesse. None of you is concerned about me or tells me that my son has incited my servant to lie in wait for me, as he does today.”"
"7795","1-Samuel","22","9","But Doeg the Edomite, who was standing with Saul’s officials, said, “I saw the son of Jesse come to Ahimelek son of Ahitub at Nob. "
"7796","1-Samuel","22","10","Ahimelek inquired of the Lord for him; he also gave him provisions and the sword of Goliath the Philistine.”"
"7797","1-Samuel","22","11","Then the king sent for the priest Ahimelek son of Ahitub and all the men of his family, who were the priests at Nob, and they all came to the king. "
"7798","1-Samuel","22","12","Saul said, “Listen now, son of Ahitub.”“Yes, my lord,” he answered."
"7799","1-Samuel","22","13","Saul said to him, “Why have you conspired against me, you and the son of Jesse, giving him bread and a sword and inquiring of God for him, so that he has rebelled against me and lies in wait for me, as he does today?”"
"7800","1-Samuel","22","14","Ahimelek answered the king, “Who of all your servants is as loyal as David, the king’s son-in-law, captain of your bodyguard and highly respected in your household? "
"7801","1-Samuel","22","15","Was that day the first time I inquired of God for him? Of course not! Let not the king accuse your servant or any of his father’s family, for your servant knows nothing at all about this whole affair.”"
"7802","1-Samuel","22","16","But the king said, “You will surely die, Ahimelek, you and your whole family.”"
"7803","1-Samuel","22","17","Then the king ordered the guards at his side: “Turn and kill the priests of the Lord, because they too have sided with David. They knew he was fleeing, yet they did not tell me.”But the king’s officials were unwilling to raise a hand to strike the priests of the Lord."
"7804","1-Samuel","22","18","The king then ordered Doeg, “You turn and strike down the priests.” So Doeg the Edomite turned and struck them down. That day he killed eighty-five men who wore the linen ephod. "
"7805","1-Samuel","22","19","He also put to the sword Nob, the town of the priests, with its men and women, its children and infants, and its cattle, donkeys and sheep."
"7806","1-Samuel","22","20","But one son of Ahimelek son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped and fled to join David. "
"7807","1-Samuel","22","21","He told David that Saul had killed the priests of the Lord. "
"7808","1-Samuel","22","22","Then David said to Abiathar, “That day, when Doeg the Edomite was there, I knew he would be sure to tell Saul. I am responsible for the death of your whole family. "
"7809","1-Samuel","22","23","Stay with me; don’t be afraid. The man who wants to kill you is trying to kill me too. You will be safe with me.”"
"7810","1-Samuel","23","1","When David was told, “Look, the Philistines are fighting against Keilah and are looting the threshing floors,” "
"7811","1-Samuel","23","2","he inquired of the Lord, saying, “Shall I go and attack these Philistines?”The Lord answered him, “Go, attack the Philistines and save Keilah.”"
"7812","1-Samuel","23","3","But David’s men said to him, “Here in Judah we are afraid. How much more, then, if we go to Keilah against the Philistine forces!”"
"7813","1-Samuel","23","4","Once again David inquired of the Lord, and the Lord answered him, “Go down to Keilah, for I am going to give the Philistines into your hand.” "
"7814","1-Samuel","23","5","So David and his men went to Keilah, fought the Philistines and carried off their livestock. He inflicted heavy losses on the Philistines and saved the people of Keilah. 6(Now Abiathar son of Ahimelek had brought the ephod down with him when he fled to David at Keilah.)Saul Pursues David"
"7815","1-Samuel","23","7","Saul was told that David had gone to Keilah, and he said, “God has delivered him into my hands, for David has imprisoned himself by entering a town with gates and bars.” "
"7816","1-Samuel","23","8","And Saul called up all his forces for battle, to go down to Keilah to besiege David and his men."
"7817","1-Samuel","23","9","When David learned that Saul was plotting against him, he said to Abiathar the priest, “Bring the ephod.” "
"7818","1-Samuel","23","10","David said, “Lord, God of Israel, your servant has heard definitely that Saul plans to come to Keilah and destroy the town on account of me. "
"7819","1-Samuel","23","11","Will the citizens of Keilah surrender me to him? Will Saul come down, as your servant has heard? Lord, God of Israel, tell your servant.”And the Lord said, “He will.”"
"7820","1-Samuel","23","12","Again David asked, “Will the citizens of Keilah surrender me and my men to Saul?”And the Lord said, “They will.”"
"7821","1-Samuel","23","13","So David and his men, about six hundred in number, left Keilah and kept moving from place to place. When Saul was told that David had escaped from Keilah, he did not go there."
"7822","1-Samuel","23","14","David stayed in the wilderness strongholds and in the hills of the Desert of Ziph. Day after day Saul searched for him, but God did not give David into his hands."
"7823","1-Samuel","23","15","While David was at Horesh in the Desert of Ziph, he learned that23:15 Or he was afraid because Saul had come out to take his life. "
"7824","1-Samuel","23","16","And Saul’s son Jonathan went to David at Horesh and helped him find strength in God.  "
"7825","1-Samuel","23","17","""Don’t be afraid,” he said. “My father Saul will not lay a hand on you. You will be king over Israel, and I will be second to you. Even my father Saul knows this.” "
"7826","1-Samuel","23","18","The two of them made a covenant before the Lord. Then Jonathan went home, but David remained at Horesh."
"7827","1-Samuel","23","19","The Ziphites went up to Saul at Gibeah and said, “Is not David hiding among us in the strongholds at Horesh, on the hill of Hakilah, south of Jeshimon? "
"7828","1-Samuel","23","20","Now, Your Majesty, come down whenever it pleases you to do so, and we will be responsible for giving him into your hands.”"
"7829","1-Samuel","23","21","Saul replied, “The Lord bless you for your concern for me. "
"7830","1-Samuel","23","22","Go and get more information. Find out where David usually goes and who has seen him there. They tell me he is very crafty. "
"7831","1-Samuel","23","23","Find out about all the hiding places he uses and come back to me with definite information. Then I will go with you; if he is in the area, I will track him down among all the clans of Judah.”"
"7832","1-Samuel","23","24","So they set out and went to Ziph ahead of Saul. Now David and his men were in the Desert of Maon, in the Arabah south of Jeshimon. "
"7833","1-Samuel","23","25","Saul and his men began the search, and when David was told about it, he went down to the rock and stayed in the Desert of Maon. When Saul heard this, he went into the Desert of Maon in pursuit of David."
"7834","1-Samuel","23","26","Saul was going along one side of the mountain, and David and his men were on the other side, hurrying to get away from Saul. As Saul and his forces were closing in on David and his men to capture them, "
"7835","1-Samuel","23","27","a messenger came to Saul, saying, “Come quickly! The Philistines are raiding the land.” "
"7836","1-Samuel","23","28","Then Saul broke off his pursuit of David and went to meet the Philistines. That is why they call this place Sela Hammahlekoth.23:28 Sela Hammahlekoth means rock of parting. "
"7837","1-Samuel","23","29","And David went up from there and lived in the strongholds of En Gedi.23:29 In Hebrew texts this verse (23:29) is numbered 24:1."
"7838","1-Samuel","24","1","After Saul returned from pursuing the Philistines, he was told, “David is in the Desert of En Gedi.” "
"7839","1-Samuel","24","2","So Saul took three thousand able young men from all Israel and set out to look for David and his men near the Crags of the Wild Goats."
"7840","1-Samuel","24","3","He came to the sheep pens along the way; a cave was there, and Saul went in to relieve himself. David and his men were far back in the cave. "
"7841","1-Samuel","24","4","The men said, “This is the day the Lord spoke of when he said24:4 Or “Today the Lord is saying to you, ‘I will give your enemy into your hands for you to deal with as you wish.’ ” Then David crept up unnoticed and cut off a corner of Saul’s robe."
"7842","1-Samuel","24","5","Afterward, David was conscience-stricken for having cut off a corner of his robe. "
"7843","1-Samuel","24","6","He said to his men, “The Lord forbid that I should do such a thing to my master, the Lord’s anointed, or lay my hand on him; for he is the anointed of the Lord.” "
"7844","1-Samuel","24","7","With these words David sharply rebuked his men and did not allow them to attack Saul. And Saul left the cave and went his way."
"7845","1-Samuel","24","8","Then David went out of the cave and called out to Saul, “My lord the king!” When Saul looked behind him, David bowed down and prostrated himself with his face to the ground. "
"7846","1-Samuel","24","9","He said to Saul, “Why do you listen when men say, ‘David is bent on harming you’? "
"7847","1-Samuel","24","10","This day you have seen with your own eyes how the Lord delivered you into my hands in the cave. Some urged me to kill you, but I spared you; I said, ‘I will not lay my hand on my lord, because he is the Lord’s anointed.’ "
"7848","1-Samuel","24","11","See, my father, look at this piece of your robe in my hand! I cut off the corner of your robe but did not kill you. See that there is nothing in my hand to indicate that I am guilty of wrongdoing or rebellion. I have not wronged you, but you are hunting me down to take my life. "
"7849","1-Samuel","24","12","May the Lord judge between you and me. And may the Lord avenge the wrongs you have done to me, but my hand will not touch you. "
"7850","1-Samuel","24","13","As the old saying goes, ‘From evildoers come evil deeds,’ so my hand will not touch you. "
"7851","1-Samuel","24","14","""Against whom has the king of Israel come out? Who are you pursuing? A dead dog? A flea? "
"7852","1-Samuel","24","15","May the Lord be our judge and decide between us. May he consider my cause and uphold it; may he vindicate me by delivering me from your hand.”"
"7853","1-Samuel","24","16","When David finished saying this, Saul asked, “Is that your voice, David my son?” And he wept aloud.  "
"7854","1-Samuel","24","17","""You are more righteous than I,” he said. “You have treated me well, but I have treated you badly. "
"7855","1-Samuel","24","18","You have just now told me about the good you did to me; the Lord delivered me into your hands, but you did not kill me. "
"7856","1-Samuel","24","19","When a man finds his enemy, does he let him get away unharmed? May the Lord reward you well for the way you treated me today. "
"7857","1-Samuel","24","20","I know that you will surely be king and that the kingdom of Israel will be established in your hands. "
"7858","1-Samuel","24","21","Now swear to me by the Lord that you will not kill off my descendants or wipe out my name from my father’s family.”"
"7859","1-Samuel","24","22","So David gave his oath to Saul. Then Saul returned home, but David and his men went up to the stronghold."
"7860","1-Samuel","25","1","Now Samuel died, and all Israel assembled and mourned for him; and they buried him at his home in Ramah. Then David moved down into the Desert of Paran.25:1 Hebrew and some Septuagint manuscripts; other Septuagint manuscripts Maon"
"7861","1-Samuel","25","2","A certain man in Maon, who had property there at Carmel, was very wealthy. He had a thousand goats and three thousand sheep, which he was shearing in Carmel. "
"7862","1-Samuel","25","3","His name was Nabal and his wife’s name was Abigail. She was an intelligent and beautiful woman, but her husband was surly and mean in his dealings—he was a Calebite."
"7863","1-Samuel","25","4","While David was in the wilderness, he heard that Nabal was shearing sheep. "
"7864","1-Samuel","25","5","So he sent ten young men and said to them, “Go up to Nabal at Carmel and greet him in my name. "
"7865","1-Samuel","25","6","Say to him: ‘Long life to you! Good health to you and your household! And good health to all that is yours! "
"7866","1-Samuel","25","7",""" ‘Now I hear that it is sheep-shearing time. When your shepherds were with us, we did not mistreat them, and the whole time they were at Carmel nothing of theirs was missing. "
"7867","1-Samuel","25","8","Ask your own servants and they will tell you. Therefore be favorable toward my men, since we come at a festive time. Please give your servants and your son David whatever you can find for them.’ ”"
"7868","1-Samuel","25","9","When David’s men arrived, they gave Nabal this message in David’s name. Then they waited."
"7869","1-Samuel","25","10","Nabal answered David’s servants, “Who is this David? Who is this son of Jesse? Many servants are breaking away from their masters these days. "
"7870","1-Samuel","25","11","Why should I take my bread and water, and the meat I have slaughtered for my shearers, and give it to men coming from who knows where?”"
"7871","1-Samuel","25","12","David’s men turned around and went back. When they arrived, they reported every word. "
"7872","1-Samuel","25","13","David said to his men, “Each of you strap on your sword!” So they did, and David strapped his on as well. About four hundred men went up with David, while two hundred stayed with the supplies."
"7873","1-Samuel","25","14","One of the servants told Abigail, Nabal’s wife, “David sent messengers from the wilderness to give our master his greetings, but he hurled insults at them. "
"7874","1-Samuel","25","15","Yet these men were very good to us. They did not mistreat us, and the whole time we were out in the fields near them nothing was missing. "
"7875","1-Samuel","25","16","Night and day they were a wall around us the whole time we were herding our sheep near them. "
"7876","1-Samuel","25","17","Now think it over and see what you can do, because disaster is hanging over our master and his whole household. He is such a wicked man that no one can talk to him.”"
"7877","1-Samuel","25","18","Abigail acted quickly. She took two hundred loaves of bread, two skins of wine, five dressed sheep, five seahs25:18 That is, probably about 60 pounds or about 27 kilograms of roasted grain, a hundred cakes of raisins and two hundred cakes of pressed figs, and loaded them on donkeys. "
"7878","1-Samuel","25","19","Then she told her servants, “Go on ahead; I’ll follow you.” But she did not tell her husband Nabal."
"7879","1-Samuel","25","20","As she came riding her donkey into a mountain ravine, there were David and his men descending toward her, and she met them. "
"7880","1-Samuel","25","21","David had just said, “It’s been useless—all my watching over this fellow’s property in the wilderness so that nothing of his was missing. He has paid me back evil for good. "
"7881","1-Samuel","25","22","May God deal with David,25:22 Some Septuagint manuscripts; Hebrew with David’s enemies be it ever so severely, if by morning I leave alive one male of all who belong to him!”"
"7882","1-Samuel","25","23","When Abigail saw David, she quickly got off her donkey and bowed down before David with her face to the ground. "
"7883","1-Samuel","25","24","She fell at his feet and said: “Pardon your servant, my lord, and let me speak to you; hear what your servant has to say. "
"7884","1-Samuel","25","25","Please pay no attention, my lord, to that wicked man Nabal. He is just like his name—his name means Fool, and folly goes with him. And as for me, your servant, I did not see the men my lord sent. "
"7885","1-Samuel","25","26","And now, my lord, as surely as the Lord your God lives and as you live, since the Lord has kept you from bloodshed and from avenging yourself with your own hands, may your enemies and all who are intent on harming my lord be like Nabal. "
"7886","1-Samuel","25","27","And let this gift, which your servant has brought to my lord, be given to the men who follow you. "
"7887","1-Samuel","25","28","""Please forgive your servant’s presumption. The Lord your God will certainly make a lasting dynasty for my lord, because you fight the Lord’s battles, and no wrongdoing will be found in you as long as you live. "
"7888","1-Samuel","25","29","Even though someone is pursuing you to take your life, the life of my lord will be bound securely in the bundle of the living by the Lord your God, but the lives of your enemies he will hurl away as from the pocket of a sling. "
"7889","1-Samuel","25","30","When the Lord has fulfilled for my lord every good thing he promised concerning him and has appointed him ruler over Israel, "
"7890","1-Samuel","25","31","my lord will not have on his conscience the staggering burden of needless bloodshed or of having avenged himself. And when the Lord your God has brought my lord success, remember your servant.”"
"7891","1-Samuel","25","32","David said to Abigail, “Praise be to the Lord, the God of Israel, who has sent you today to meet me. "
"7892","1-Samuel","25","33","May you be blessed for your good judgment and for keeping me from bloodshed this day and from avenging myself with my own hands. "
"7893","1-Samuel","25","34","Otherwise, as surely as the Lord, the God of Israel, lives, who has kept me from harming you, if you had not come quickly to meet me, not one male belonging to Nabal would have been left alive by daybreak.”"
"7894","1-Samuel","25","35","Then David accepted from her hand what she had brought him and said, “Go home in peace. I have heard your words and granted your request.”"
"7895","1-Samuel","25","36","When Abigail went to Nabal, he was in the house holding a banquet like that of a king. He was in high spirits and very drunk. So she told him nothing at all until daybreak. "
"7896","1-Samuel","25","37","Then in the morning, when Nabal was sober, his wife told him all these things, and his heart failed him and he became like a stone. "
"7897","1-Samuel","25","38","About ten days later, the Lord struck Nabal and he died."
"7898","1-Samuel","25","39","When David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, “Praise be to the Lord, who has upheld my cause against Nabal for treating me with contempt. He has kept his servant from doing wrong and has brought Nabal’s wrongdoing down on his own head.”Then David sent word to Abigail, asking her to become his wife. "
"7899","1-Samuel","25","40","His servants went to Carmel and said to Abigail, “David has sent us to you to take you to become his wife.”"
"7900","1-Samuel","25","41","She bowed down with her face to the ground and said, “I am your servant and am ready to serve you and wash the feet of my lord’s servants.” "
"7901","1-Samuel","25","42","Abigail quickly got on a donkey and, attended by her five female servants, went with David’s messengers and became his wife. "
"7902","1-Samuel","25","43","David had also married Ahinoam of Jezreel, and they both were his wives. "
"7903","1-Samuel","25","44","But Saul had given his daughter Michal, David’s wife, to Paltiel25:44 Hebrew Palti, a variant of Paltiel son of Laish, who was from Gallim."
"7904","1-Samuel","26","1","The Ziphites went to Saul at Gibeah and said, “Is not David hiding on the hill of Hakilah, which faces Jeshimon?”"
"7905","1-Samuel","26","2","So Saul went down to the Desert of Ziph, with his three thousand select Israelite troops, to search there for David. "
"7906","1-Samuel","26","3","Saul made his camp beside the road on the hill of Hakilah facing Jeshimon, but David stayed in the wilderness. When he saw that Saul had followed him there, "
"7907","1-Samuel","26","4","he sent out scouts and learned that Saul had definitely arrived."
"7908","1-Samuel","26","5","Then David set out and went to the place where Saul had camped. He saw where Saul and Abner son of Ner, the commander of the army, had lain down. Saul was lying inside the camp, with the army encamped around him."
"7909","1-Samuel","26","6","David then asked Ahimelek the Hittite and Abishai son of Zeruiah, Joab’s brother, “Who will go down into the camp with me to Saul?”“I’ll go with you,” said Abishai."
"7910","1-Samuel","26","7","So David and Abishai went to the army by night, and there was Saul, lying asleep inside the camp with his spear stuck in the ground near his head. Abner and the soldiers were lying around him."
"7911","1-Samuel","26","8","Abishai said to David, “Today God has delivered your enemy into your hands. Now let me pin him to the ground with one thrust of the spear; I won’t strike him twice.”"
"7912","1-Samuel","26","9","But David said to Abishai, “Don’t destroy him! Who can lay a hand on the Lord’s anointed and be guiltless? "
"7913","1-Samuel","26","10","As surely as the Lord lives,” he said, “the Lord himself will strike him, or his time will come and he will die, or he will go into battle and perish. "
"7914","1-Samuel","26","11","But the Lord forbid that I should lay a hand on the Lord’s anointed. Now get the spear and water jug that are near his head, and let’s go.”"
"7915","1-Samuel","26","12","So David took the spear and water jug near Saul’s head, and they left. No one saw or knew about it, nor did anyone wake up. They were all sleeping, because the Lord had put them into a deep sleep."
"7916","1-Samuel","26","13","Then David crossed over to the other side and stood on top of the hill some distance away; there was a wide space between them. "
"7917","1-Samuel","26","14","He called out to the army and to Abner son of Ner, “Aren’t you going to answer me, Abner?”Abner replied, “Who are you who calls to the king?”"
"7918","1-Samuel","26","15","David said, “You’re a man, aren’t you? And who is like you in Israel? Why didn’t you guard your lord the king? Someone came to destroy your lord the king. "
"7919","1-Samuel","26","16","What you have done is not good. As surely as the Lord lives, you and your men must die, because you did not guard your master, the Lord’s anointed. Look around you. Where are the king’s spear and water jug that were near his head?”"
"7920","1-Samuel","26","17","Saul recognized David’s voice and said, “Is that your voice, David my son?”David replied, “Yes it is, my lord the king.” "
"7921","1-Samuel","26","18","And he added, “Why is my lord pursuing his servant? What have I done, and what wrong am I guilty of? "
"7922","1-Samuel","26","19","Now let my lord the king listen to his servant’s words. If the Lord has incited you against me, then may he accept an offering. If, however, people have done it, may they be cursed before the Lord! They have driven me today from my share in the Lord’s inheritance and have said, ‘Go, serve other gods.’ "
"7923","1-Samuel","26","20","Now do not let my blood fall to the ground far from the presence of the Lord. The king of Israel has come out to look for a flea—as one hunts a partridge in the mountains.”"
"7924","1-Samuel","26","21","Then Saul said, “I have sinned. Come back, David my son. Because you considered my life precious today, I will not try to harm you again. Surely I have acted like a fool and have been terribly wrong.” "
"7925","1-Samuel","26","22","""Here is the king’s spear,” David answered. “Let one of your young men come over and get it. "
"7926","1-Samuel","26","23","The Lord rewards everyone for their righteousness and faithfulness. The Lord delivered you into my hands today, but I would not lay a hand on the Lord’s anointed. "
"7927","1-Samuel","26","24","As surely as I valued your life today, so may the Lord value my life and deliver me from all trouble.”"
"7928","1-Samuel","26","25","Then Saul said to David, “May you be blessed, David my son; you will do great things and surely triumph.”So David went on his way, and Saul returned home."
"7929","1-Samuel","27","1","But David thought to himself, “One of these days I will be destroyed by the hand of Saul. The best thing I can do is to escape to the land of the Philistines. Then Saul will give up searching for me anywhere in Israel, and I will slip out of his hand.”"
"7930","1-Samuel","27","2","So David and the six hundred men with him left and went over to Achish son of Maok king of Gath. "
"7931","1-Samuel","27","3","David and his men settled in Gath with Achish. Each man had his family with him, and David had his two wives: Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail of Carmel, the widow of Nabal. "
"7932","1-Samuel","27","4","When Saul was told that David had fled to Gath, he no longer searched for him."
"7933","1-Samuel","27","5","Then David said to Achish, “If I have found favor in your eyes, let a place be assigned to me in one of the country towns, that I may live there. Why should your servant live in the royal city with you?”"
"7934","1-Samuel","27","6","So on that day Achish gave him Ziklag, and it has belonged to the kings of Judah ever since. "
"7935","1-Samuel","27","7","David lived in Philistine territory a year and four months."
"7936","1-Samuel","27","8","Now David and his men went up and raided the Geshurites, the Girzites and the Amalekites. (From ancient times these peoples had lived in the land extending to Shur and Egypt.) "
"7937","1-Samuel","27","9","Whenever David attacked an area, he did not leave a man or woman alive, but took sheep and cattle, donkeys and camels, and clothes. Then he returned to Achish."
"7938","1-Samuel","27","10","When Achish asked, “Where did you go raiding today?” David would say, “Against the Negev of Judah” or “Against the Negev of Jerahmeel” or “Against the Negev of the Kenites.” "
"7939","1-Samuel","27","11","He did not leave a man or woman alive to be brought to Gath, for he thought, “They might inform on us and say, ‘This is what David did.’ ” And such was his practice as long as he lived in Philistine territory. "
"7940","1-Samuel","27","12","Achish trusted David and said to himself, “He has become so obnoxious to his people, the Israelites, that he will be my servant for life.”"
"7941","1-Samuel","28","1","In those days the Philistines gathered their forces to fight against Israel. Achish said to David, “You must understand that you and your men will accompany me in the army.”"
"7942","1-Samuel","28","2","David said, “Then you will see for yourself what your servant can do.”Achish replied, “Very well, I will make you my bodyguard for life.”Saul and the Medium at Endor"
"7943","1-Samuel","28","3","Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had mourned for him and buried him in his own town of Ramah. Saul had expelled the mediums and spiritists from the land."
"7944","1-Samuel","28","4","The Philistines assembled and came and set up camp at Shunem, while Saul gathered all Israel and set up camp at Gilboa. "
"7945","1-Samuel","28","5","When Saul saw the Philistine army, he was afraid; terror filled his heart. "
"7946","1-Samuel","28","6","He inquired of the Lord, but the Lord did not answer him by dreams or Urim or prophets. "
"7947","1-Samuel","28","7","Saul then said to his attendants, “Find me a woman who is a medium, so I may go and inquire of her.”“There is one in Endor,” they said."
"7948","1-Samuel","28","8","So Saul disguised himself, putting on other clothes, and at night he and two men went to the woman. “Consult a spirit for me,” he said, “and bring up for me the one I name.”"
"7949","1-Samuel","28","9","But the woman said to him, “Surely you know what Saul has done. He has cut off the mediums and spiritists from the land. Why have you set a trap for my life to bring about my death?”"
"7950","1-Samuel","28","10","Saul swore to her by the Lord, “As surely as the Lord lives, you will not be punished for this.”"
"7951","1-Samuel","28","11","Then the woman asked, “Whom shall I bring up for you?”“Bring up Samuel,” he said."
"7952","1-Samuel","28","12","When the woman saw Samuel, she cried out at the top of her voice and said to Saul, “Why have you deceived me? You are Saul!”"
"7953","1-Samuel","28","13","The king said to her, “Don’t be afraid. What do you see?”The woman said, “I see a ghostly figure28:13 Or see spirits; or see gods coming up out of the earth.” "
"7954","1-Samuel","28","14","""What does he look like?” he asked.“An old man wearing a robe is coming up,” she said.Then Saul knew it was Samuel, and he bowed down and prostrated himself with his face to the ground."
"7955","1-Samuel","28","15","Samuel said to Saul, “Why have you disturbed me by bringing me up?”“I am in great distress,” Saul said. “The Philistines are fighting against me, and God has departed from me. He no longer answers me, either by prophets or by dreams. So I have called on you to tell me what to do.”"
"7956","1-Samuel","28","16","Samuel said, “Why do you consult me, now that the Lord has departed from you and become your enemy? "
"7957","1-Samuel","28","17","The Lord has done what he predicted through me. The Lord has torn the kingdom out of your hands and given it to one of your neighbors—to David. "
"7958","1-Samuel","28","18","Because you did not obey the Lord or carry out his fierce wrath against the Amalekites, the Lord has done this to you today. "
"7959","1-Samuel","28","19","The Lord will deliver both Israel and you into the hands of the Philistines, and tomorrow you and your sons will be with me. The Lord will also give the army of Israel into the hands of the Philistines.”"
"7960","1-Samuel","28","20","Immediately Saul fell full length on the ground, filled with fear because of Samuel’s words. His strength was gone, for he had eaten nothing all that day and all that night."
"7961","1-Samuel","28","21","When the woman came to Saul and saw that he was greatly shaken, she said, “Look, your servant has obeyed you. I took my life in my hands and did what you told me to do. "
"7962","1-Samuel","28","22","Now please listen to your servant and let me give you some food so you may eat and have the strength to go on your way.”"
"7963","1-Samuel","28","23","He refused and said, “I will not eat.”But his men joined the woman in urging him, and he listened to them. He got up from the ground and sat on the couch."
"7964","1-Samuel","28","24","The woman had a fattened calf at the house, which she butchered at once. She took some flour, kneaded it and baked bread without yeast. "
"7965","1-Samuel","28","25","Then she set it before Saul and his men, and they ate. That same night they got up and left."
"7966","1-Samuel","29","1","The Philistines gathered all their forces at Aphek, and Israel camped by the spring in Jezreel. "
"7967","1-Samuel","29","2","As the Philistine rulers marched with their units of hundreds and thousands, David and his men were marching at the rear with Achish. "
"7968","1-Samuel","29","3","The commanders of the Philistines asked, “What about these Hebrews?”Achish replied, “Is this not David, who was an officer of Saul king of Israel? He has already been with me for over a year, and from the day he left Saul until now, I have found no fault in him.”"
"7969","1-Samuel","29","4","But the Philistine commanders were angry with Achish and said, “Send the man back, that he may return to the place you assigned him. He must not go with us into battle, or he will turn against us during the fighting. How better could he regain his master’s favor than by taking the heads of our own men? "
"7970","1-Samuel","29","5","Isn’t this the David they sang about in their dances:“ ‘Saul has slain his thousands,and David his tens of thousands’?”"
"7971","1-Samuel","29","6","So Achish called David and said to him, “As surely as the Lord lives, you have been reliable, and I would be pleased to have you serve with me in the army. From the day you came to me until today, I have found no fault in you, but the rulers don’t approve of you. "
"7972","1-Samuel","29","7","Now turn back and go in peace; do nothing to displease the Philistine rulers.” "
"7973","1-Samuel","29","8","""But what have I done?” asked David. “What have you found against your servant from the day I came to you until now? Why can’t I go and fight against the enemies of my lord the king?”"
"7974","1-Samuel","29","9","Achish answered, “I know that you have been as pleasing in my eyes as an angel of God; nevertheless, the Philistine commanders have said, ‘He must not go up with us into battle.’ "
"7975","1-Samuel","29","10","Now get up early, along with your master’s servants who have come with you, and leave in the morning as soon as it is light.”"
"7976","1-Samuel","29","11","So David and his men got up early in the morning to go back to the land of the Philistines, and the Philistines went up to Jezreel."
"7977","1-Samuel","30","1","David and his men reached Ziklag on the third day. Now the Amalekites had raided the Negev and Ziklag. They had attacked Ziklag and burned it, "
"7978","1-Samuel","30","2","and had taken captive the women and everyone else in it, both young and old. They killed none of them, but carried them off as they went on their way."
"7979","1-Samuel","30","3","When David and his men reached Ziklag, they found it destroyed by fire and their wives and sons and daughters taken captive. "
"7980","1-Samuel","30","4","So David and his men wept aloud until they had no strength left to weep. "
"7981","1-Samuel","30","5","David’s two wives had been captured—Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail, the widow of Nabal of Carmel. "
"7982","1-Samuel","30","6","David was greatly distressed because the men were talking of stoning him; each one was bitter in spirit because of his sons and daughters. But David found strength in the Lord his God."
"7983","1-Samuel","30","7","Then David said to Abiathar the priest, the son of Ahimelek, “Bring me the ephod.” Abiathar brought it to him, "
"7984","1-Samuel","30","8","and David inquired of the Lord, “Shall I pursue this raiding party? Will I overtake them?”“Pursue them,” he answered. “You will certainly overtake them and succeed in the rescue.”"
"7985","1-Samuel","30","9","David and the six hundred men with him came to the Besor Valley, where some stayed behind. "
"7986","1-Samuel","30","10","Two hundred of them were too exhausted to cross the valley, but David and the other four hundred continued the pursuit."
"7987","1-Samuel","30","11","They found an Egyptian in a field and brought him to David. They gave him water to drink and food to eat— "
"7988","1-Samuel","30","12","part of a cake of pressed figs and two cakes of raisins. He ate and was revived, for he had not eaten any food or drunk any water for three days and three nights."
"7989","1-Samuel","30","13","David asked him, “Who do you belong to? Where do you come from?”He said, “I am an Egyptian, the slave of an Amalekite. My master abandoned me when I became ill three days ago. "
"7990","1-Samuel","30","14","We raided the Negev of the Kerethites, some territory belonging to Judah and the Negev of Caleb. And we burned Ziklag.”"
"7991","1-Samuel","30","15","David asked him, “Can you lead me down to this raiding party?”He answered, “Swear to me before God that you will not kill me or hand me over to my master, and I will take you down to them.”"
"7992","1-Samuel","30","16","He led David down, and there they were, scattered over the countryside, eating, drinking and reveling because of the great amount of plunder they had taken from the land of the Philistines and from Judah. "
"7993","1-Samuel","30","17","David fought them from dusk until the evening of the next day, and none of them got away, except four hundred young men who rode off on camels and fled. "
"7994","1-Samuel","30","18","David recovered everything the Amalekites had taken, including his two wives. "
"7995","1-Samuel","30","19","Nothing was missing: young or old, boy or girl, plunder or anything else they had taken. David brought everything back. "
"7996","1-Samuel","30","20","He took all the flocks and herds, and his men drove them ahead of the other livestock, saying, “This is David’s plunder.”"
"7997","1-Samuel","30","21","Then David came to the two hundred men who had been too exhausted to follow him and who were left behind at the Besor Valley. They came out to meet David and the men with him. As David and his men approached, he asked them how they were. "
"7998","1-Samuel","30","22","But all the evil men and troublemakers among David’s followers said, “Because they did not go out with us, we will not share with them the plunder we recovered. However, each man may take his wife and children and go.”"
"7999","1-Samuel","30","23","David replied, “No, my brothers, you must not do that with what the Lord has given us. He has protected us and delivered into our hands the raiding party that came against us. "
"8000","1-Samuel","30","24","Who will listen to what you say? The share of the man who stayed with the supplies is to be the same as that of him who went down to the battle. All will share alike.” "
"8001","1-Samuel","30","25","David made this a statute and ordinance for Israel from that day to this."
"8002","1-Samuel","30","26","When David reached Ziklag, he sent some of the plunder to the elders of Judah, who were his friends, saying, “Here is a gift for you from the plunder of the Lord’s enemies.”"
"8003","1-Samuel","30","27","David sent it to those who were in Bethel, Ramoth Negev and Jattir; "
"8004","1-Samuel","30","28","to those in Aroer, Siphmoth, Eshtemoa "
"8005","1-Samuel","30","29","and Rakal; to those in the towns of the Jerahmeelites and the Kenites; "
"8006","1-Samuel","30","30","to those in Hormah, Bor Ashan, Athak "
"8007","1-Samuel","30","31","and Hebron; and to those in all the other places where he and his men had roamed."
"8008","1-Samuel","31","1","Now the Philistines fought against Israel; the Israelites fled before them, and many fell dead on Mount Gilboa. "
"8009","1-Samuel","31","2","The Philistines were in hot pursuit of Saul and his sons, and they killed his sons Jonathan, Abinadab and Malki-Shua. "
"8010","1-Samuel","31","3","The fighting grew fierce around Saul, and when the archers overtook him, they wounded him critically."
"8011","1-Samuel","31","4","Saul said to his armor-bearer, “Draw your sword and run me through, or these uncircumcised fellows will come and run me through and abuse me.”But his armor-bearer was terrified and would not do it; so Saul took his own sword and fell on it. "
"8012","1-Samuel","31","5","When the armor-bearer saw that Saul was dead, he too fell on his sword and died with him. "
"8013","1-Samuel","31","6","So Saul and his three sons and his armor-bearer and all his men died together that same day."
"8014","1-Samuel","31","7","When the Israelites along the valley and those across the Jordan saw that the Israelite army had fled and that Saul and his sons had died, they abandoned their towns and fled. And the Philistines came and occupied them."
"8015","1-Samuel","31","8","The next day, when the Philistines came to strip the dead, they found Saul and his three sons fallen on Mount Gilboa. "
"8016","1-Samuel","31","9","They cut off his head and stripped off his armor, and they sent messengers throughout the land of the Philistines to proclaim the news in the temple of their idols and among their people. "
"8017","1-Samuel","31","10","They put his armor in the temple of the Ashtoreths and fastened his body to the wall of Beth Shan."
"8018","1-Samuel","31","11","When the people of Jabesh Gilead heard what the Philistines had done to Saul, "
"8019","1-Samuel","31","12","all their valiant men marched through the night to Beth Shan. They took down the bodies of Saul and his sons from the wall of Beth Shan and went to Jabesh, where they burned them. "
"8020","1-Samuel","31","13","Then they took their bones and buried them under a tamarisk tree at Jabesh, and they fasted seven days."
"8021","1 Samuel","1","1","There was a certain man from Ramathaim, a Zuphite1:1 See Septuagint and 1 Chron. 6:26-27,33-35; or from Ramathaim Zuphim. from the hill country of Ephraim, whose name was Elkanah son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite. "
"8022","1 Samuel","1","2","He had two wives; one was called Hannah and the other Peninnah. Peninnah had children, but Hannah had none."
"8023","1 Samuel","1","3","Year after year this man went up from his town to worship and sacrifice to the Lord Almighty at Shiloh, where Hophni and Phinehas, the two sons of Eli, were priests of the Lord. "
"8024","1 Samuel","1","4","Whenever the day came for Elkanah to sacrifice, he would give portions of the meat to his wife Peninnah and to all her sons and daughters. "
"8025","1 Samuel","1","5","But to Hannah he gave a double portion because he loved her, and the Lord had closed her womb. "
"8026","1 Samuel","1","6","Because the Lord had closed Hannah’s womb, her rival kept provoking her in order to irritate her. "
"8027","1 Samuel","1","7","This went on year after year. Whenever Hannah went up to the house of the Lord, her rival provoked her till she wept and would not eat. "
"8028","1 Samuel","1","8","Her husband Elkanah would say to her, “Hannah, why are you weeping? Why don’t you eat? Why are you downhearted? Don’t I mean more to you than ten sons?”"
"8029","1 Samuel","1","9","Once when they had finished eating and drinking in Shiloh, Hannah stood up. Now Eli the priest was sitting on his chair by the doorpost of the Lord’s house. "
"8030","1 Samuel","1","10","In her deep anguish Hannah prayed to the Lord, weeping bitterly. "
"8031","1 Samuel","1","11","And she made a vow, saying, “Lord Almighty, if you will only look on your servant’s misery and remember me, and not forget your servant but give her a son, then I will give him to the Lord for all the days of his life, and no razor will ever be used on his head.”"
"8032","1 Samuel","1","12","As she kept on praying to the Lord, Eli observed her mouth. "
"8033","1 Samuel","1","13","Hannah was praying in her heart, and her lips were moving but her voice was not heard. Eli thought she was drunk "
"8034","1 Samuel","1","14","and said to her, “How long are you going to stay drunk? Put away your wine.” "
"8035","1 Samuel","1","15","""Not so, my lord,” Hannah replied, “I am a woman who is deeply troubled. I have not been drinking wine or beer; I was pouring out my soul to the Lord. "
"8036","1 Samuel","1","16","Do not take your servant for a wicked woman; I have been praying here out of my great anguish and grief.”"
"8037","1 Samuel","1","17","Eli answered, “Go in peace, and may the God of Israel grant you what you have asked of him.”"
"8038","1 Samuel","1","18","She said, “May your servant find favor in your eyes.” Then she went her way and ate something, and her face was no longer downcast."
"8039","1 Samuel","1","19","Early the next morning they arose and worshiped before the Lord and then went back to their home at Ramah. Elkanah made love to his wife Hannah, and the Lord remembered her. "
"8040","1 Samuel","1","20","So in the course of time Hannah became pregnant and gave birth to a son. She named him Samuel,1:20 Samuel sounds like the Hebrew for heard by God. saying, “Because I asked the Lord for him.”Hannah Dedicates Samuel"
"8041","1 Samuel","1","21","When her husband Elkanah went up with all his family to offer the annual sacrifice to the Lord and to fulfill his vow, "
"8042","1 Samuel","1","22","Hannah did not go. She said to her husband, “After the boy is weaned, I will take him and present him before the Lord, and he will live there always.”1:22 Masoretic Text; Dead Sea Scrolls always. I have dedicated him as a Nazirite—all the days of his life.” "
"8043","1 Samuel","1","23","""Do what seems best to you,” her husband Elkanah told her. “Stay here until you have weaned him; only may the Lord make good his1:23 Masoretic Text; Dead Sea Scrolls, Septuagint and Syriac your word.” So the woman stayed at home and nursed her son until she had weaned him."
"8044","1 Samuel","1","24","After he was weaned, she took the boy with her, young as he was, along with a three-year-old bull,1:24 Dead Sea Scrolls, Septuagint and Syriac; Masoretic Text with three bulls an ephah1:24 That is, probably about 36 pounds or about 16 kilograms of flour and a skin of wine, and brought him to the house of the Lord at Shiloh. "
"8045","1 Samuel","1","25","When the bull had been sacrificed, they brought the boy to Eli, "
"8046","1 Samuel","1","26","and she said to him, “Pardon me, my lord. As surely as you live, I am the woman who stood here beside you praying to the Lord. "
"8047","1 Samuel","1","27","I prayed for this child, and the Lord has granted me what I asked of him. "
"8048","1 Samuel","1","28","So now I give him to the Lord. For his whole life he will be given over to the Lord.” And he worshiped the Lord there."
"8049","1 Samuel","2","1","Then Hannah prayed and said:“My heart rejoices in the Lord;in the Lord my horn2:1 Horn here symbolizes strength; also in verse 10. is lifted high.My mouth boasts over my enemies,for I delight in your deliverance. "
"8050","1 Samuel","2","2","""There is no one holy like the Lord;there is no one besides you;there is no Rock like our God. "
"8051","1 Samuel","2","3","""Do not keep talking so proudlyor let your mouth speak such arrogance,for the Lord is a God who knows,and by him deeds are weighed. "
"8052","1 Samuel","2","4","""The bows of the warriors are broken,but those who stumbled are armed with strength."
"8053","1 Samuel","2","5","Those who were full hire themselves out for food,but those who were hungry are hungry no more.She who was barren has borne seven children,but she who has had many sons pines away. "
"8054","1 Samuel","2","6","""The Lord brings death and makes alive;he brings down to the grave and raises up."
"8055","1 Samuel","2","7","The Lord sends poverty and wealth;he humbles and he exalts."

"8059","1 Samuel","2","11","Then Elkanah went home to Ramah, but the boy ministered before the Lord under Eli the priest.Eli’s Wicked Sons"
"8060","1 Samuel","2","12","Eli’s sons were scoundrels; they had no regard for the Lord. "
"8061","1 Samuel","2","13","Now it was the practice of the priests that, whenever any of the people offered a sacrifice, the priest’s servant would come with a three-pronged fork in his hand while the meat was being boiled "
"8062","1 Samuel","2","14","and would plunge the fork into the pan or kettle or caldron or pot. Whatever the fork brought up the priest would take for himself. This is how they treated all the Israelites who came to Shiloh. "
"8063","1 Samuel","2","15","But even before the fat was burned, the priest’s servant would come and say to the person who was sacrificing, “Give the priest some meat to roast; he won’t accept boiled meat from you, but only raw.”"
"8064","1 Samuel","2","16","If the person said to him, “Let the fat be burned first, and then take whatever you want,” the servant would answer, “No, hand it over now; if you don’t, I’ll take it by force.”"
"8065","1 Samuel","2","17","This sin of the young men was very great in the Lord’s sight, for they2:17 Dead Sea Scrolls and Septuagint; Masoretic Text people were treating the Lord’s offering with contempt."
"8066","1 Samuel","2","18","But Samuel was ministering before the Lord—a boy wearing a linen ephod. "
"8067","1 Samuel","2","19","Each year his mother made him a little robe and took it to him when she went up with her husband to offer the annual sacrifice. "
"8068","1 Samuel","2","20","Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife, saying, “May the Lord give you children by this woman to take the place of the one she prayed for and gave to2:20 Dead Sea Scrolls; Masoretic Text and asked from the Lord.” Then they would go home. "
"8069","1 Samuel","2","21","And the Lord was gracious to Hannah; she gave birth to three sons and two daughters. Meanwhile, the boy Samuel grew up in the presence of the Lord."
"8070","1 Samuel","2","22","Now Eli, who was very old, heard about everything his sons were doing to all Israel and how they slept with the women who served at the entrance to the tent of meeting. "
"8071","1 Samuel","2","23","So he said to them, “Why do you do such things? I hear from all the people about these wicked deeds of yours. "
"8072","1 Samuel","2","24","No, my sons; the report I hear spreading among the Lord’s people is not good. "
"8073","1 Samuel","2","25","If one person sins against another, God2:25 Or the judges may mediate for the offender; but if anyone sins against the Lord, who will intercede for them?” His sons, however, did not listen to their father’s rebuke, for it was the Lord’s will to put them to death."
"8074","1 Samuel","2","26","And the boy Samuel continued to grow in stature and in favor with the Lord and with people.Prophecy Against the House of Eli"
"8075","1 Samuel","2","27","Now a man of God came to Eli and said to him, “This is what the Lord says: ‘Did I not clearly reveal myself to your ancestor’s family when they were in Egypt under Pharaoh? "
"8076","1 Samuel","2","28","I chose your ancestor out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to go up to my altar, to burn incense, and to wear an ephod in my presence. I also gave your ancestor’s family all the food offerings presented by the Israelites. "
"8077","1 Samuel","2","29","Why do you2:29 The Hebrew is plural. scorn my sacrifice and offering that I prescribed for my dwelling? Why do you honor your sons more than me by fattening yourselves on the choice parts of every offering made by my people Israel?’ "
"8078","1 Samuel","2","30","""Therefore the Lord, the God of Israel, declares: ‘I promised that members of your family would minister before me forever.’ But now the Lord declares: ‘Far be it from me! Those who honor me I will honor, but those who despise me will be disdained. "
"8079","1 Samuel","2","31","The time is coming when I will cut short your strength and the strength of your priestly house, so that no one in it will reach old age, "
"8080","1 Samuel","2","32","and you will see distress in my dwelling. Although good will be done to Israel, no one in your family line will ever reach old age. "
"8081","1 Samuel","2","33","Every one of you that I do not cut off from serving at my altar I will spare only to destroy your sight and sap your strength, and all your descendants will die in the prime of life. "
"8082","1 Samuel","2","34",""" ‘And what happens to your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, will be a sign to you—they will both die on the same day. "

"8084","1 Samuel","2","36","Then everyone left in your family line will come and bow down before him for a piece of silver and a loaf of bread and plead, “Appoint me to some priestly office so I can have food to eat.” ’ ”"
"8085","1 Samuel","3","1","The boy Samuel ministered before the Lord under Eli. In those days the word of the Lord was rare; there were not many visions."
"8086","1 Samuel","3","2","One night Eli, whose eyes were becoming so weak that he could barely see, was lying down in his usual place. "
"8087","1 Samuel","3","3","The lamp of God had not yet gone out, and Samuel was lying down in the house of the Lord, where the ark of God was. "
"8088","1 Samuel","3","4","Then the Lord called Samuel.Samuel answered, “Here I am.” "
"8089","1 Samuel","3","5","And he ran to Eli and said, “Here I am; you called me.”But Eli said, “I did not call; go back and lie down.” So he went and lay down."
"8090","1 Samuel","3","6","Again the Lord called, “Samuel!” And Samuel got up and went to Eli and said, “Here I am; you called me.”“My son,” Eli said, “I did not call; go back and lie down.”"
"8091","1 Samuel","3","7","Now Samuel did not yet know the Lord: The word of the Lord had not yet been revealed to him."
"8092","1 Samuel","3","8","A third time the Lord called, “Samuel!” And Samuel got up and went to Eli and said, “Here I am; you called me.”Then Eli realized that the Lord was calling the boy. "
"8093","1 Samuel","3","9","So Eli told Samuel, “Go and lie down, and if he calls you, say, ‘Speak, Lord, for your servant is listening.’ ” So Samuel went and lay down in his place."
"8094","1 Samuel","3","10","The Lord came and stood there, calling as at the other times, “Samuel! Samuel!”Then Samuel said, “Speak, for your servant is listening.”"
"8095","1 Samuel","3","11","And the Lord said to Samuel: “See, I am about to do something in Israel that will make the ears of everyone who hears about it tingle. "
"8096","1 Samuel","3","12","At that time I will carry out against Eli everything I spoke against his family—from beginning to end. "
"8097","1 Samuel","3","13","For I told him that I would judge his family forever because of the sin he knew about; his sons blasphemed God,3:13 An ancient Hebrew scribal tradition (see also Septuagint); Masoretic Text sons made themselves contemptible and he failed to restrain them. "
"8098","1 Samuel","3","14","Therefore I swore to the house of Eli, ‘The guilt of Eli’s house will never be atoned for by sacrifice or offering.’ ”"
"8099","1 Samuel","3","15","Samuel lay down until morning and then opened the doors of the house of the Lord. He was afraid to tell Eli the vision, "
"8100","1 Samuel","3","16","but Eli called him and said, “Samuel, my son.”Samuel answered, “Here I am.” "
"8101","1 Samuel","3","17","""What was it he said to you?” Eli asked. “Do not hide it from me. May God deal with you, be it ever so severely, if you hide from me anything he told you.” "
"8102","1 Samuel","3","18","So Samuel told him everything, hiding nothing from him. Then Eli said, “He is the Lord; let him do what is good in his eyes.”"
"8103","1 Samuel","3","19","The Lord was with Samuel as he grew up, and he let none of Samuel’s words fall to the ground. "
"8104","1 Samuel","3","20","And all Israel from Dan to Beersheba recognized that Samuel was attested as a prophet of the Lord. "
"8105","1 Samuel","3","21","The Lord continued to appear at Shiloh, and there he revealed himself to Samuel through his word."
"8106","1 Samuel","4","1","And Samuel’s word came to all Israel.The Philistines Capture the ArkNow the Israelites went out to fight against the Philistines. The Israelites camped at Ebenezer, and the Philistines at Aphek. "
"8107","1 Samuel","4","2","The Philistines deployed their forces to meet Israel, and as the battle spread, Israel was defeated by the Philistines, who killed about four thousand of them on the battlefield. "
"8108","1 Samuel","4","3","When the soldiers returned to camp, the elders of Israel asked, “Why did the Lord bring defeat on us today before the Philistines? Let us bring the ark of the Lord’s covenant from Shiloh, so that he may go with us and save us from the hand of our enemies.”"
"8109","1 Samuel","4","4","So the people sent men to Shiloh, and they brought back the ark of the covenant of the Lord Almighty, who is enthroned between the cherubim. And Eli’s two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God."
"8110","1 Samuel","4","5","When the ark of the Lord’s covenant came into the camp, all Israel raised such a great shout that the ground shook. "
"8111","1 Samuel","4","6","Hearing the uproar, the Philistines asked, “What’s all this shouting in the Hebrew camp?”When they learned that the ark of the Lord had come into the camp, "
"8112","1 Samuel","4","7","the Philistines were afraid. “A god has4:7 Or “Gods have (see Septuagint) come into the camp,” they said. “Oh no! Nothing like this has happened before. "
"8113","1 Samuel","4","8","We’re doomed! Who will deliver us from the hand of these mighty gods? They are the gods who struck the Egyptians with all kinds of plagues in the wilderness. "
"8114","1 Samuel","4","9","Be strong, Philistines! Be men, or you will be subject to the Hebrews, as they have been to you. Be men, and fight!”"
"8115","1 Samuel","4","10","So the Philistines fought, and the Israelites were defeated and every man fled to his tent. The slaughter was very great; Israel lost thirty thousand foot soldiers. "
"8116","1 Samuel","4","11","The ark of God was captured, and Eli’s two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, died.Death of Eli"
"8117","1 Samuel","4","12","That same day a Benjamite ran from the battle line and went to Shiloh with his clothes torn and dust on his head. "
"8118","1 Samuel","4","13","When he arrived, there was Eli sitting on his chair by the side of the road, watching, because his heart feared for the ark of God. When the man entered the town and told what had happened, the whole town sent up a cry."
"8119","1 Samuel","4","14","Eli heard the outcry and asked, “What is the meaning of this uproar?”The man hurried over to Eli, "
"8120","1 Samuel","4","15","who was ninety-eight years old and whose eyes had failed so that he could not see. "
"8121","1 Samuel","4","16","He told Eli, “I have just come from the battle line; I fled from it this very day.”Eli asked, “What happened, my son?”"
"8122","1 Samuel","4","17","The man who brought the news replied, “Israel fled before the Philistines, and the army has suffered heavy losses. Also your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God has been captured.”"
"8123","1 Samuel","4","18","When he mentioned the ark of God, Eli fell backward off his chair by the side of the gate. His neck was broken and he died, for he was an old man, and he was heavy. He had led4:18 Traditionally judged Israel forty years."
"8124","1 Samuel","4","19","His daughter-in-law, the wife of Phinehas, was pregnant and near the time of delivery. When she heard the news that the ark of God had been captured and that her father-in-law and her husband were dead, she went into labor and gave birth, but was overcome by her labor pains. "
"8125","1 Samuel","4","20","As she was dying, the women attending her said, “Don’t despair; you have given birth to a son.” But she did not respond or pay any attention."
"8126","1 Samuel","4","21","She named the boy Ichabod,4:21 Ichabod means no glory. saying, “The Glory has departed from Israel”—because of the capture of the ark of God and the deaths of her father-in-law and her husband. "
"8127","1 Samuel","4","22","She said, “The Glory has departed from Israel, for the ark of God has been captured.”"
"8128","1 Samuel","5","1","After the Philistines had captured the ark of God, they took it from Ebenezer to Ashdod. "
"8129","1 Samuel","5","2","Then they carried the ark into Dagon’s temple and set it beside Dagon. "
"8130","1 Samuel","5","3","When the people of Ashdod rose early the next day, there was Dagon, fallen on his face on the ground before the ark of the Lord! They took Dagon and put him back in his place. "
"8131","1 Samuel","5","4","But the following morning when they rose, there was Dagon, fallen on his face on the ground before the ark of the Lord! His head and hands had been broken off and were lying on the threshold; only his body remained. "
"8132","1 Samuel","5","5","That is why to this day neither the priests of Dagon nor any others who enter Dagon’s temple at Ashdod step on the threshold."
"8133","1 Samuel","5","6","The Lord’s hand was heavy on the people of Ashdod and its vicinity; he brought devastation on them and afflicted them with tumors.5:6 Hebrew; Septuagint and Vulgate tumors. And rats appeared in their land, and there was death and destruction throughout the city "
"8134","1 Samuel","5","7","When the people of Ashdod saw what was happening, they said, “The ark of the god of Israel must not stay here with us, because his hand is heavy on us and on Dagon our god.” "
"8135","1 Samuel","5","8","So they called together all the rulers of the Philistines and asked them, “What shall we do with the ark of the god of Israel?”They answered, “Have the ark of the god of Israel moved to Gath.” So they moved the ark of the God of Israel."
"8136","1 Samuel","5","9","But after they had moved it, the Lord’s hand was against that city, throwing it into a great panic. He afflicted the people of the city, both young and old, with an outbreak of tumors.5:9 Or with tumors in the groin (see Septuagint) "
"8137","1 Samuel","5","10","So they sent the ark of God to Ekron.As the ark of God was entering Ekron, the people of Ekron cried out, “They have brought the ark of the god of Israel around to us to kill us and our people.” "
"8138","1 Samuel","5","11","So they called together all the rulers of the Philistines and said, “Send the ark of the god of Israel away; let it go back to its own place, or it5:11 Or he will kill us and our people.” For death had filled the city with panic; God’s hand was very heavy on it. "
"8139","1 Samuel","5","12","Those who did not die were afflicted with tumors, and the outcry of the city went up to heaven."
"8140","1 Samuel","6","1","When the ark of the Lord had been in Philistine territory seven months, "
"8141","1 Samuel","6","2","the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners and said, “What shall we do with the ark of the Lord? Tell us how we should send it back to its place.”"
"8142","1 Samuel","6","3","They answered, “If you return the ark of the god of Israel, do not send it back to him without a gift; by all means send a guilt offering to him. Then you will be healed, and you will know why his hand has not been lifted from you.”"
"8143","1 Samuel","6","4","The Philistines asked, “What guilt offering should we send to him?”They replied, “Five gold tumors and five gold rats, according to the number of the Philistine rulers, because the same plague has struck both you and your rulers. "
"8144","1 Samuel","6","5","Make models of the tumors and of the rats that are destroying the country, and give glory to Israel’s god. Perhaps he will lift his hand from you and your gods and your land. "
"8145","1 Samuel","6","6","Why do you harden your hearts as the Egyptians and Pharaoh did? When Israel’s god dealt harshly with them, did they not send the Israelites out so they could go on their way? "
"8146","1 Samuel","6","7","""Now then, get a new cart ready, with two cows that have calved and have never been yoked. Hitch the cows to the cart, but take their calves away and pen them up. "
"8147","1 Samuel","6","8","Take the ark of the Lord and put it on the cart, and in a chest beside it put the gold objects you are sending back to him as a guilt offering. Send it on its way, "
"8148","1 Samuel","6","9","but keep watching it. If it goes up to its own territory, toward Beth Shemesh, then the Lord has brought this great disaster on us. But if it does not, then we will know that it was not his hand that struck us but that it happened to us by chance.”"
"8149","1 Samuel","6","10","So they did this. They took two such cows and hitched them to the cart and penned up their calves. "
"8150","1 Samuel","6","11","They placed the ark of the Lord on the cart and along with it the chest containing the gold rats and the models of the tumors. "
"8151","1 Samuel","6","12","Then the cows went straight up toward Beth Shemesh, keeping on the road and lowing all the way; they did not turn to the right or to the left. The rulers of the Philistines followed them as far as the border of Beth Shemesh."
"8152","1 Samuel","6","13","Now the people of Beth Shemesh were harvesting their wheat in the valley, and when they looked up and saw the ark, they rejoiced at the sight. "
"8153","1 Samuel","6","14","The cart came to the field of Joshua of Beth Shemesh, and there it stopped beside a large rock. The people chopped up the wood of the cart and sacrificed the cows as a burnt offering to the Lord. "
"8154","1 Samuel","6","15","The Levites took down the ark of the Lord, together with the chest containing the gold objects, and placed them on the large rock. On that day the people of Beth Shemesh offered burnt offerings and made sacrifices to the Lord. "
"8155","1 Samuel","6","16","The five rulers of the Philistines saw all this and then returned that same day to Ekron."
"8156","1 Samuel","6","17","These are the gold tumors the Philistines sent as a guilt offering to the Lord—one each for Ashdod, Gaza, Ashkelon, Gath and Ekron. "
"8157","1 Samuel","6","18","And the number of the gold rats was according to the number of Philistine towns belonging to the five rulers—the fortified towns with their country villages. The large rock on which the Levites set the ark of the Lord is a witness to this day in the field of Joshua of Beth Shemesh."
"8158","1 Samuel","6","19","But God struck down some of the inhabitants of Beth Shemesh, putting seventy6:19 A few Hebrew manuscripts; most Hebrew manuscripts and Septuagint 50,070 of them to death because they looked into the ark of the Lord.

"8159","1 Samuel","6","20","And the people of Beth Shemesh asked, “Who can stand in the presence of the Lord, this holy God? To whom will the ark go up from here?”"
"8160","1 Samuel","6","21","Then they sent messengers to the people of Kiriath Jearim, saying, “The Philistines have returned the ark of the Lord. Come down and take it up to your town.”"
"8161","1 Samuel","7","1","So the men of Kiriath Jearim came and took up the ark of the Lord. They brought it to Abinadab’s house on the hill and consecrated Eleazar his son to guard the ark of the Lord. "
"8162","1 Samuel","7","2","The ark remained at Kiriath Jearim a long time—twenty years in all.Samuel Subdues the Philistines at MizpahThen all the people of Israel turned back to the Lord. "
"8163","1 Samuel","7","3","So Samuel said to all the Israelites, “If you are returning to the Lord with all your hearts, then rid yourselves of the foreign gods and the Ashtoreths and commit yourselves to the Lord and serve him only, and he will deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines.” "
"8164","1 Samuel","7","4","So the Israelites put away their Baals and Ashtoreths, and served the Lord only."
"8165","1 Samuel","7","5","Then Samuel said, “Assemble all Israel at Mizpah, and I will intercede with the Lord for you.” "
"8166","1 Samuel","7","6","When they had assembled at Mizpah, they drew water and poured it out before the Lord. On that day they fasted and there they confessed, “We have sinned against the Lord.” Now Samuel was serving as leader7:6 Traditionally judge; also in verse 15 of Israel at Mizpah."
"8167","1 Samuel","7","7","When the Philistines heard that Israel had assembled at Mizpah, the rulers of the Philistines came up to attack them. When the Israelites heard of it, they were afraid because of the Philistines. "
"8168","1 Samuel","7","8","They said to Samuel, “Do not stop crying out to the Lord our God for us, that he may rescue us from the hand of the Philistines.” "
"8169","1 Samuel","7","9","Then Samuel took a suckling lamb and sacrificed it as a whole burnt offering to the Lord. He cried out to the Lord on Israel’s behalf, and the Lord answered him."
"8170","1 Samuel","7","10","While Samuel was sacrificing the burnt offering, the Philistines drew near to engage Israel in battle. But that day the Lord thundered with loud thunder against the Philistines and threw them into such a panic that they were routed before the Israelites. "
"8171","1 Samuel","7","11","The men of Israel rushed out of Mizpah and pursued the Philistines, slaughtering them along the way to a point below Beth Kar."
"8172","1 Samuel","7","12","Then Samuel took a stone and set it up between Mizpah and Shen. He named it Ebenezer,7:12 Ebenezer means stone of help. saying, “Thus far the Lord has helped us.”"
"8173","1 Samuel","7","13","So the Philistines were subdued and they stopped invading Israel’s territory. Throughout Samuel’s lifetime, the hand of the Lord was against the Philistines. "
"8174","1 Samuel","7","14","The towns from Ekron to Gath that the Philistines had captured from Israel were restored to Israel, and Israel delivered the neighboring territory from the hands of the Philistines. And there was peace between Israel and the Amorites."
"8175","1 Samuel","7","15","Samuel continued as Israel’s leader all the days of his life. "
"8176","1 Samuel","7","16","From year to year he went on a circuit from Bethel to Gilgal to Mizpah, judging Israel in all those places. "
"8177","1 Samuel","7","17","But he always went back to Ramah, where his home was, and there he also held court for Israel. And he built an altar there to the Lord."
"8178","1 Samuel","8","1","When Samuel grew old, he appointed his sons as Israel’s leaders.8:1 Traditionally judges "
"8179","1 Samuel","8","2","The name of his firstborn was Joel and the name of his second was Abijah, and they served at Beersheba. "
"8180","1 Samuel","8","3","But his sons did not follow his ways. They turned aside after dishonest gain and accepted bribes and perverted justice."
"8181","1 Samuel","8","4","So all the elders of Israel gathered together and came to Samuel at Ramah. "
"8182","1 Samuel","8","5","They said to him, “You are old, and your sons do not follow your ways; now appoint a king to lead8:5 Traditionally judge; also in verses 6 and 20 us, such as all the other nations have.”"
"8183","1 Samuel","8","6","But when they said, “Give us a king to lead us,” this displeased Samuel; so he prayed to the Lord. "
"8184","1 Samuel","8","7","And the Lord told him: “Listen to all that the people are saying to you; it is not you they have rejected, but they have rejected me as their king. "
"8185","1 Samuel","8","8","As they have done from the day I brought them up out of Egypt until this day, forsaking me and serving other gods, so they are doing to you. "
"8186","1 Samuel","8","9","Now listen to them; but warn them solemnly and let them know what the king who will reign over them will claim as his rights.”"
"8187","1 Samuel","8","10","Samuel told all the words of the Lord to the people who were asking him for a king. "
"8188","1 Samuel","8","11","He said, “This is what the king who will reign over you will claim as his rights: He will take your sons and make them serve with his chariots and horses, and they will run in front of his chariots. "
"8189","1 Samuel","8","12","Some he will assign to be commanders of thousands and commanders of fifties, and others to plow his ground and reap his harvest, and still others to make weapons of war and equipment for his chariots. "
"8190","1 Samuel","8","13","He will take your daughters to be perfumers and cooks and bakers. "
"8191","1 Samuel","8","14","He will take the best of your fields and vineyards and olive groves and give them to his attendants. "
"8192","1 Samuel","8","15","He will take a tenth of your grain and of your vintage and give it to his officials and attendants. "
"8193","1 Samuel","8","16","Your male and female servants and the best of your cattle8:16 Septuagint; Hebrew young men and donkeys he will take for his own use. "
"8194","1 Samuel","8","17","He will take a tenth of your flocks, and you yourselves will become his slaves. "
"8195","1 Samuel","8","18","When that day comes, you will cry out for relief from the king you have chosen, but the Lord will not answer you in that day.”"
"8196","1 Samuel","8","19","But the people refused to listen to Samuel. “No!” they said. “We want a king over us. "
"8197","1 Samuel","8","20","Then we will be like all the other nations, with a king to lead us and to go out before us and fight our battles.”"
"8198","1 Samuel","8","21","When Samuel heard all that the people said, he repeated it before the Lord. "
"8199","1 Samuel","8","22","The Lord answered, “Listen to them and give them a king.”Then Samuel said to the Israelites, “Everyone go back to your own town.”"
"8200","1 Samuel","9","1","There was a Benjamite, a man of standing, whose name was Kish son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Bekorath, the son of Aphiah of Benjamin. "
"8201","1 Samuel","9","2","Kish had a son named Saul, as handsome a young man as could be found anywhere in Israel, and he was a head taller than anyone else."
"8202","1 Samuel","9","3","Now the donkeys belonging to Saul’s father Kish were lost, and Kish said to his son Saul, “Take one of the servants with you and go and look for the donkeys.” "
"8203","1 Samuel","9","4","So he passed through the hill country of Ephraim and through the area around Shalisha, but they did not find them. They went on into the district of Shaalim, but the donkeys were not there. Then he passed through the territory of Benjamin, but they did not find them."
"8204","1 Samuel","9","5","When they reached the district of Zuph, Saul said to the servant who was with him, “Come, let’s go back, or my father will stop thinking about the donkeys and start worrying about us.”"
"8205","1 Samuel","9","6","But the servant replied, “Look, in this town there is a man of God; he is highly respected, and everything he says comes true. Let’s go there now. Perhaps he will tell us what way to take.”"
"8206","1 Samuel","9","7","Saul said to his servant, “If we go, what can we give the man? The food in our sacks is gone. We have no gift to take to the man of God. What do we have?”"
"8207","1 Samuel","9","8","The servant answered him again. “Look,” he said, “I have a quarter of a shekel9:8 That is, about 1/10 ounce or about 3 grams of silver. I will give it to the man of God so that he will tell us what way to take.” 9(Formerly in Israel, if someone went to inquire of God, they would say, “Come, let us go to the seer,” because the prophet of today used to be called a seer.) "
"8208","1 Samuel","9","10","""Good,” Saul said to his servant. “Come, let’s go.” So they set out for the town where the man of God was."
"8209","1 Samuel","9","11","As they were going up the hill to the town, they met some young women coming out to draw water, and they asked them, “Is the seer here?” "
"8210","1 Samuel","9","12","""He is,” they answered. “He’s ahead of you. Hurry now; he has just come to our town today, for the people have a sacrifice at the high place. "
"8211","1 Samuel","9","13","As soon as you enter the town, you will find him before he goes up to the high place to eat. The people will not begin eating until he comes, because he must bless the sacrifice; afterward, those who are invited will eat. Go up now; you should find him about this time.”"
"8212","1 Samuel","9","14","They went up to the town, and as they were entering it, there was Samuel, coming toward them on his way up to the high place."
"8213","1 Samuel","9","15","Now the day before Saul came, the Lord had revealed this to Samuel:  "
"8214","1 Samuel","9","16","""About this time tomorrow I will send you a man from the land of Benjamin. Anoint him ruler over my people Israel; he will deliver them from the hand of the Philistines. I have looked on my people, for their cry has reached me.”"
"8215","1 Samuel","9","17","When Samuel caught sight of Saul, the Lord said to him, “This is the man I spoke to you about; he will govern my people.”"
"8216","1 Samuel","9","18","Saul approached Samuel in the gateway and asked, “Would you please tell me where the seer’s house is?” "
"8217","1 Samuel","9","19","""I am the seer,” Samuel replied. “Go up ahead of me to the high place, for today you are to eat with me, and in the morning I will send you on your way and will tell you all that is in your heart. "
"8218","1 Samuel","9","20","As for the donkeys you lost three days ago, do not worry about them; they have been found. And to whom is all the desire of Israel turned, if not to you and your whole family line?”"
"8219","1 Samuel","9","21","Saul answered, “But am I not a Benjamite, from the smallest tribe of Israel, and is not my clan the least of all the clans of the tribe of Benjamin? Why do you say such a thing to me?”"
"8220","1 Samuel","9","22","Then Samuel brought Saul and his servant into the hall and seated them at the head of those who were invited—about thirty in number. "
"8221","1 Samuel","9","23","Samuel said to the cook, “Bring the piece of meat I gave you, the one I told you to lay aside.”"
"8222","1 Samuel","9","24","So the cook took up the thigh with what was on it and set it in front of Saul. Samuel said, “Here is what has been kept for you. Eat, because it was set aside for you for this occasion from the time I said, ‘I have invited guests.’ ” And Saul dined with Samuel that day."
"8223","1 Samuel","9","25","After they came down from the high place to the town, Samuel talked with Saul on the roof of his house. "
"8224","1 Samuel","9","26","They rose about daybreak, and Samuel called to Saul on the roof, “Get ready, and I will send you on your way.” When Saul got ready, he and Samuel went outside together. "
"8225","1 Samuel","9","27","As they were going down to the edge of the town, Samuel said to Saul, “Tell the servant to go on ahead of us”—and the servant did so—“but you stay here for a while, so that I may give you a message from God.”"
"8226","1 Samuel","10","1","Then Samuel took a flask of olive oil and poured it on Saul’s head and kissed him, saying, “Has not the Lord anointed you ruler over his inheritance?10:1 Hebrew; Septuagint and Vulgate over his people Israel? You will reign over the Lord’s people and save them from the power of their enemies round about. And this will be a sign to you that the Lord has anointed you ruler over his inheritance: "
"8227","1 Samuel","10","2","When you leave me today, you will meet two men near Rachel’s tomb, at Zelzah on the border of Benjamin. They will say to you, ‘The donkeys you set out to look for have been found. And now your father has stopped thinking about them and is worried about you. He is asking, “What shall I do about my son?” ’ "
"8228","1 Samuel","10","3","""Then you will go on from there until you reach the great tree of Tabor. Three men going up to worship God at Bethel will meet you there. One will be carrying three young goats, another three loaves of bread, and another a skin of wine. "
"8229","1 Samuel","10","4","They will greet you and offer you two loaves of bread, which you will accept from them. "
"8230","1 Samuel","10","5","""After that you will go to Gibeah of God, where there is a Philistine outpost. As you approach the town, you will meet a procession of prophets coming down from the high place with lyres, timbrels, pipes and harps being played before them, and they will be prophesying. "
"8231","1 Samuel","10","6","The Spirit of the Lord will come powerfully upon you, and you will prophesy with them; and you will be changed into a different person. "
"8232","1 Samuel","10","7","Once these signs are fulfilled, do whatever your hand finds to do, for God is with you. "
"8233","1 Samuel","10","8","""Go down ahead of me to Gilgal. I will surely come down to you to sacrifice burnt offerings and fellowship offerings, but you must wait seven days until I come to you and tell you what you are to do.”Saul Made King"
"8234","1 Samuel","10","9","As Saul turned to leave Samuel, God changed Saul’s heart, and all these signs were fulfilled that day. "
"8235","1 Samuel","10","10","When he and his servant arrived at Gibeah, a procession of prophets met him; the Spirit of God came powerfully upon him, and he joined in their prophesying. "
"8236","1 Samuel","10","11","When all those who had formerly known him saw him prophesying with the prophets, they asked each other, “What is this that has happened to the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?”"
"8237","1 Samuel","10","12","A man who lived there answered, “And who is their father?” So it became a saying: “Is Saul also among the prophets?” "
"8238","1 Samuel","10","13","After Saul stopped prophesying, he went to the high place."
"8239","1 Samuel","10","14","Now Saul’s uncle asked him and his servant, “Where have you been?”“Looking for the donkeys,” he said. “But when we saw they were not to be found, we went to Samuel.”"
"8240","1 Samuel","10","15","Saul’s uncle said, “Tell me what Samuel said to you.”"
"8241","1 Samuel","10","16","Saul replied, “He assured us that the donkeys had been found.” But he did not tell his uncle what Samuel had said about the kingship."
"8242","1 Samuel","10","17","Samuel summoned the people of Israel to the Lord at Mizpah "
"8243","1 Samuel","10","18","and said to them, “This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: ‘I brought Israel up out of Egypt, and I delivered you from the power of Egypt and all the kingdoms that oppressed you.’ "
"8244","1 Samuel","10","19","But you have now rejected your God, who saves you out of all your disasters and calamities. And you have said, ‘No, appoint a king over us.’ So now present yourselves before the Lord by your tribes and clans.”"
"8245","1 Samuel","10","20","When Samuel had all Israel come forward by tribes, the tribe of Benjamin was taken by lot. "
"8246","1 Samuel","10","21","Then he brought forward the tribe of Benjamin, clan by clan, and Matri’s clan was taken. Finally Saul son of Kish was taken. But when they looked for him, he was not to be found. "
"8247","1 Samuel","10","22","So they inquired further of the Lord, “Has the man come here yet?”And the Lord said, “Yes, he has hidden himself among the supplies.”"
"8248","1 Samuel","10","23","They ran and brought him out, and as he stood among the people he was a head taller than any of the others. "
"8249","1 Samuel","10","24","Samuel said to all the people, “Do you see the man the Lord has chosen? There is no one like him among all the people.”Then the people shouted, “Long live the king!”"
"8250","1 Samuel","10","25","Samuel explained to the people the rights and duties of kingship. He wrote them down on a scroll and deposited it before the Lord. Then Samuel dismissed the people to go to their own homes."
"8251","1 Samuel","10","26","Saul also went to his home in Gibeah, accompanied by valiant men whose hearts God had touched. "
"8252","1 Samuel","10","27","But some scoundrels said, “How can this fellow save us?” They despised him and brought him no gifts. But Saul kept silent."
"8253","1 Samuel","11","1","Nahash11:1 Masoretic Text; Dead Sea Scrolls gifts. Now Nahash king of the Ammonites oppressed the Gadites and Reubenites severely. He gouged out all their right eyes and struck terror and dread in Israel. Not a man remained among the Israelites beyond the Jordan whose right eye was not gouged out by Nahash king of the Ammonites, except that seven thousand men fled from the Ammonites and entered Jabesh Gilead. About a month later, 1 Nahash the Ammonite went up and besieged Jabesh Gilead. And all the men of Jabesh said to him, “Make a treaty with us, and we will be subject to you.”"
"8254","1 Samuel","11","2","But Nahash the Ammonite replied, “I will make a treaty with you only on the condition that I gouge out the right eye of every one of you and so bring disgrace on all Israel.”"
"8255","1 Samuel","11","3","The elders of Jabesh said to him, “Give us seven days so we can send messengers throughout Israel; if no one comes to rescue us, we will surrender to you.”"
"8256","1 Samuel","11","4","When the messengers came to Gibeah of Saul and reported these terms to the people, they all wept aloud. "
"8257","1 Samuel","11","5","Just then Saul was returning from the fields, behind his oxen, and he asked, “What is wrong with everyone? Why are they weeping?” Then they repeated to him what the men of Jabesh had said."
"8258","1 Samuel","11","6","When Saul heard their words, the Spirit of God came powerfully upon him, and he burned with anger. "
"8259","1 Samuel","11","7","He took a pair of oxen, cut them into pieces, and sent the pieces by messengers throughout Israel, proclaiming, “This is what will be done to the oxen of anyone who does not follow Saul and Samuel.” Then the terror of the Lord fell on the people, and they came out together as one. "
"8260","1 Samuel","11","8","When Saul mustered them at Bezek, the men of Israel numbered three hundred thousand and those of Judah thirty thousand."
"8261","1 Samuel","11","9","They told the messengers who had come, “Say to the men of Jabesh Gilead, ‘By the time the sun is hot tomorrow, you will be rescued.’ ” When the messengers went and reported this to the men of Jabesh, they were elated. "
"8262","1 Samuel","11","10","They said to the Ammonites, “Tomorrow we will surrender to you, and you can do to us whatever you like.”"
"8263","1 Samuel","11","11","The next day Saul separated his men into three divisions; during the last watch of the night they broke into the camp of the Ammonites and slaughtered them until the heat of the day. Those who survived were scattered, so that no two of them were left together.Saul Confirmed as King"
"8264","1 Samuel","11","12","The people then said to Samuel, “Who was it that asked, ‘Shall Saul reign over us?’ Turn these men over to us so that we may put them to death.”"
"8265","1 Samuel","11","13","But Saul said, “No one will be put to death today, for this day the Lord has rescued Israel.”"
"8266","1 Samuel","11","14","Then Samuel said to the people, “Come, let us go to Gilgal and there renew the kingship.” "
"8267","1 Samuel","11","15","So all the people went to Gilgal and made Saul king in the presence of the Lord. There they sacrificed fellowship offerings before the Lord, and Saul and all the Israelites held a great celebration."
"8268","1 Samuel","12","1","Samuel said to all Israel, “I have listened to everything you said to me and have set a king over you. "
"8269","1 Samuel","12","2","Now you have a king as your leader. As for me, I am old and gray, and my sons are here with you. I have been your leader from my youth until this day. "
"8270","1 Samuel","12","3","Here I stand. Testify against me in the presence of the Lord and his anointed. Whose ox have I taken? Whose donkey have I taken? Whom have I cheated? Whom have I oppressed? From whose hand have I accepted a bribe to make me shut my eyes? If I have done any of these things, I will make it right.” "
"8271","1 Samuel","12","4","""You have not cheated or oppressed us,” they replied. “You have not taken anything from anyone’s hand.”"
"8272","1 Samuel","12","5","Samuel said to them, “The Lord is witness against you, and also his anointed is witness this day, that you have not found anything in my hand.”“He is witness,” they said."
"8273","1 Samuel","12","6","Then Samuel said to the people, “It is the Lord who appointed Moses and Aaron and brought your ancestors up out of Egypt. "
"8274","1 Samuel","12","7","Now then, stand here, because I am going to confront you with evidence before the Lord as to all the righteous acts performed by the Lord for you and your ancestors. "
"8275","1 Samuel","12","8","""After Jacob entered Egypt, they cried to the Lord for help, and the Lord sent Moses and Aaron, who brought your ancestors out of Egypt and settled them in this place. "
"8276","1 Samuel","12","9","""But they forgot the Lord their God; so he sold them into the hand of Sisera, the commander of the army of Hazor, and into the hands of the Philistines and the king of Moab, who fought against them. "
"8277","1 Samuel","12","10","They cried out to the Lord and said, ‘We have sinned; we have forsaken the Lord and served the Baals and the Ashtoreths. But now deliver us from the hands of our enemies, and we will serve you.’ "
"8278","1 Samuel","12","11","Then the Lord sent Jerub-Baal,12:11 Also called Gideon Barak,12:11 Some Septuagint manuscripts and Syriac; Hebrew Bedan Jephthah and Samuel,12:11 Hebrew; some Septuagint manuscripts and Syriac Samson and he delivered you from the hands of your enemies all around you, so that you lived in safety.

"8279","1 Samuel","12","12","""But when you saw that Nahash king of the Ammonites was moving against you, you said to me, ‘No, we want a king to rule over us’—even though the Lord your God was your king. "
"8280","1 Samuel","12","13","Now here is the king you have chosen, the one you asked for; see, the Lord has set a king over you. "
"8281","1 Samuel","12","14","If you fear the Lord and serve and obey him and do not rebel against his commands, and if both you and the king who reigns over you follow the Lord your God—good! "
"8282","1 Samuel","12","15","But if you do not obey the Lord, and if you rebel against his commands, his hand will be against you, as it was against your ancestors. "
"8283","1 Samuel","12","16","""Now then, stand still and see this great thing the Lord is about to do before your eyes! "
"8284","1 Samuel","12","17","Is it not wheat harvest now? I will call on the Lord to send thunder and rain. And you will realize what an evil thing you did in the eyes of the Lord when you asked for a king.”"
"8285","1 Samuel","12","18","Then Samuel called on the Lord, and that same day the Lord sent thunder and rain. So all the people stood in awe of the Lord and of Samuel."
"8286","1 Samuel","12","19","The people all said to Samuel, “Pray to the Lord your God for your servants so that we will not die, for we have added to all our other sins the evil of asking for a king.” "
"8287","1 Samuel","12","20","""Do not be afraid,” Samuel replied. “You have done all this evil; yet do not turn away from the Lord, but serve the Lord with all your heart. "
"8288","1 Samuel","12","21","Do not turn away after useless idols. They can do you no good, nor can they rescue you, because they are useless. "
"8289","1 Samuel","12","22","For the sake of his great name the Lord will not reject his people, because the Lord was pleased to make you his own. "
"8290","1 Samuel","12","23","As for me, far be it from me that I should sin against the Lord by failing to pray for you. And I will teach you the way that is good and right. "
"8291","1 Samuel","12","24","But be sure to fear the Lord and serve him faithfully with all your heart; consider what great things he has done for you. "

"8293","1 Samuel","13","1","Saul was thirty13:1 A few late manuscripts of the Septuagint; Hebrew does not have thirty. years old when he became king, and he reigned over Israel forty-13:1 Probable reading of the original Hebrew text (see Acts 13:21); Masoretic Text does not have forty-. two years."
"8294","1 Samuel","13","2","Saul chose three thousand men from Israel; two thousand were with him at Mikmash and in the hill country of Bethel, and a thousand were with Jonathan at Gibeah in Benjamin. The rest of the men he sent back to their homes."
"8295","1 Samuel","13","3","Jonathan attacked the Philistine outpost at Geba, and the Philistines heard about it. Then Saul had the trumpet blown throughout the land and said, “Let the Hebrews hear!” "
"8296","1 Samuel","13","4","So all Israel heard the news: “Saul has attacked the Philistine outpost, and now Israel has become obnoxious to the Philistines.” And the people were summoned to join Saul at Gilgal."
"8297","1 Samuel","13","5","The Philistines assembled to fight Israel, with three thousand13:5 Some Septuagint manuscripts and Syriac; Hebrew thirty thousand chariots, six thousand charioteers, and soldiers as numerous as the sand on the seashore.

"8298","1 Samuel","13","6","When the Israelites saw that their situation was critical and that their army was hard pressed, they hid in caves and thickets, among the rocks, and in pits and cisterns. "

"8300","1 Samuel","13","8","He waited seven days, the time set by Samuel; but Samuel did not come to Gilgal, and Saul’s men began to scatter. "
"8301","1 Samuel","13","9","So he said, “Bring me the burnt offering and the fellowship offerings.” And Saul offered up the burnt offering. "
"8302","1 Samuel","13","10","Just as he finished making the offering, Samuel arrived, and Saul went out to greet him. "
"8303","1 Samuel","13","11","""What have you done?” asked Samuel.Saul replied, “When I saw that the men were scattering, and that you did not come at the set time, and that the Philistines were assembling at Mikmash, "
"8304","1 Samuel","13","12","I thought, ‘Now the Philistines will come down against me at Gilgal, and I have not sought the Lord’s favor.’ So I felt compelled to offer the burnt offering.” "
"8305","1 Samuel","13","13","""You have done a foolish thing,” Samuel said. “You have not kept the command the Lord your God gave you; if you had, he would have established your kingdom over Israel for all time. "
"8306","1 Samuel","13","14","But now your kingdom will not endure; the Lord has sought out a man after his own heart and appointed him ruler of his people, because you have not kept the Lord’s command.”"

"8309","1 Samuel","13","17","Raiding parties went out from the Philistine camp in three detachments. One turned toward Ophrah in the vicinity of Shual, "
"8310","1 Samuel","13","18","another toward Beth Horon, and the third toward the borderland overlooking the Valley of Zeboyim facing the wilderness."
"8311","1 Samuel","13","19","Not a blacksmith could be found in the whole land of Israel, because the Philistines had said, “Otherwise the Hebrews will make swords or spears!” "
"8312","1 Samuel","13","20","So all Israel went down to the Philistines to have their plow points, mattocks, axes and sickles13:20 Septuagint; Hebrew plow points sharpened. "
"8313","1 Samuel","13","21","The price was two-thirds of a shekel13:21 That is, about 1/4 ounce or about 8 grams for sharpening plow points and mattocks, and a third of a shekel13:21 That is, about 1/8 ounce or about 4 grams for sharpening forks and axes and for repointing goads."
"8314","1 Samuel","13","22","So on the day of the battle not a soldier with Saul and Jonathan had a sword or spear in his hand; only Saul and his son Jonathan had them.Jonathan Attacks the Philistines"
"8315","1 Samuel","13","23","Now a detachment of Philistines had gone out to the pass at Mikmash."
"8316","1 Samuel","14","1","One day Jonathan son of Saul said to his young armor-bearer, “Come, let’s go over to the Philistine outpost on the other side.” But he did not tell his father."
"8317","1 Samuel","14","2","Saul was staying on the outskirts of Gibeah under a pomegranate tree in Migron. With him were about six hundred men, "
"8318","1 Samuel","14","3","among whom was Ahijah, who was wearing an ephod. He was a son of Ichabod’s brother Ahitub son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the Lord’s priest in Shiloh. No one was aware that Jonathan had left."
"8319","1 Samuel","14","4","On each side of the pass that Jonathan intended to cross to reach the Philistine outpost was a cliff; one was called Bozez and the other Seneh. "
"8320","1 Samuel","14","5","One cliff stood to the north toward Mikmash, the other to the south toward Geba."
"8321","1 Samuel","14","6","Jonathan said to his young armor-bearer, “Come, let’s go over to the outpost of those uncircumcised men. Perhaps the Lord will act in our behalf. Nothing can hinder the Lord from saving, whether by many or by few.” "
"8322","1 Samuel","14","7","""Do all that you have in mind,” his armor-bearer said. “Go ahead; I am with you heart and soul.”"
"8323","1 Samuel","14","8","Jonathan said, “Come on, then; we will cross over toward them and let them see us. "
"8324","1 Samuel","14","9","If they say to us, ‘Wait there until we come to you,’ we will stay where we are and not go up to them. "
"8325","1 Samuel","14","10","But if they say, ‘Come up to us,’ we will climb up, because that will be our sign that the Lord has given them into our hands.”"
"8326","1 Samuel","14","11","So both of them showed themselves to the Philistine outpost. “Look!” said the Philistines. “The Hebrews are crawling out of the holes they were hiding in.” "
"8327","1 Samuel","14","12","The men of the outpost shouted to Jonathan and his armor-bearer, “Come up to us and we’ll teach you a lesson.”So Jonathan said to his armor-bearer, “Climb up after me; the Lord has given them into the hand of Israel.”"
"8328","1 Samuel","14","13","Jonathan climbed up, using his hands and feet, with his armor-bearer right behind him. The Philistines fell before Jonathan, and his armor-bearer followed and killed behind him. "
"8329","1 Samuel","14","14","In that first attack Jonathan and his armor-bearer killed some twenty men in an area of about half an acre.Israel Routs the Philistines"
"8330","1 Samuel","14","15","Then panic struck the whole army—those in the camp and field, and those in the outposts and raiding parties—and the ground shook. It was a panic sent by God.14:15 Or a terrible panic"
"8331","1 Samuel","14","16","Saul’s lookouts at Gibeah in Benjamin saw the army melting away in all directions. "
"8332","1 Samuel","14","17","Then Saul said to the men who were with him, “Muster the forces and see who has left us.” When they did, it was Jonathan and his armor-bearer who were not there."
"8333","1 Samuel","14","18","Saul said to Ahijah, “Bring the ark of God.” (At that time it was with the Israelites.)14:18 Hebrew; Septuagint “Bring the ephod.” (At that time he wore the ephod before the Israelites.) "
"8334","1 Samuel","14","19","While Saul was talking to the priest, the tumult in the Philistine camp increased more and more. So Saul said to the priest, “Withdraw your hand.”"
"8335","1 Samuel","14","20","Then Saul and all his men assembled and went to the battle. They found the Philistines in total confusion, striking each other with their swords. "
"8336","1 Samuel","14","21","Those Hebrews who had previously been with the Philistines and had gone up with them to their camp went over to the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan. "
"8337","1 Samuel","14","22","When all the Israelites who had hidden in the hill country of Ephraim heard that the Philistines were on the run, they joined the battle in hot pursuit. "
"8338","1 Samuel","14","23","So on that day the Lord saved Israel, and the battle moved on beyond Beth Aven.Jonathan Eats Honey"
"8339","1 Samuel","14","24","Now the Israelites were in distress that day, because Saul had bound the people under an oath, saying, “Cursed be anyone who eats food before evening comes, before I have avenged myself on my enemies!” So none of the troops tasted food."
"8340","1 Samuel","14","25","The entire army entered the woods, and there was honey on the ground. "
"8341","1 Samuel","14","26","When they went into the woods, they saw the honey oozing out; yet no one put his hand to his mouth, because they feared the oath. "
"8342","1 Samuel","14","27","But Jonathan had not heard that his father had bound the people with the oath, so he reached out the end of the staff that was in his hand and dipped it into the honeycomb. He raised his hand to his mouth, and his eyes brightened.14:27 Or his strength was renewed; similarly in verse 29 "
"8343","1 Samuel","14","28","Then one of the soldiers told him, “Your father bound the army under a strict oath, saying, ‘Cursed be anyone who eats food today!’ That is why the men are faint.”"
"8344","1 Samuel","14","29","Jonathan said, “My father has made trouble for the country. See how my eyes brightened when I tasted a little of this honey. "
"8345","1 Samuel","14","30","How much better it would have been if the men had eaten today some of the plunder they took from their enemies. Would not the slaughter of the Philistines have been even greater?”"
"8346","1 Samuel","14","31","That day, after the Israelites had struck down the Philistines from Mikmash to Aijalon, they were exhausted. "
"8347","1 Samuel","14","32","They pounced on the plunder and, taking sheep, cattle and calves, they butchered them on the ground and ate them, together with the blood. "
"8348","1 Samuel","14","33","Then someone said to Saul, “Look, the men are sinning against the Lord by eating meat that has blood in it.”“You have broken faith,” he said. “Roll a large stone over here at once.” "
"8349","1 Samuel","14","34","Then he said, “Go out among the men and tell them, ‘Each of you bring me your cattle and sheep, and slaughter them here and eat them. Do not sin against the Lord by eating meat with blood still in it.’ ”So everyone brought his ox that night and slaughtered it there. "
"8350","1 Samuel","14","35","Then Saul built an altar to the Lord; it was the first time he had done this."
"8351","1 Samuel","14","36","Saul said, “Let us go down and pursue the Philistines by night and plunder them till dawn, and let us not leave one of them alive.”“Do whatever seems best to you,” they replied.But the priest said, “Let us inquire of God here.”"
"8352","1 Samuel","14","37","So Saul asked God, “Shall I go down and pursue the Philistines? Will you give them into Israel’s hand?” But God did not answer him that day."
"8353","1 Samuel","14","38","Saul therefore said, “Come here, all you who are leaders of the army, and let us find out what sin has been committed today. "
"8354","1 Samuel","14","39","As surely as the Lord who rescues Israel lives, even if the guilt lies with my son Jonathan, he must die.” But not one of them said a word."
"8355","1 Samuel","14","40","Saul then said to all the Israelites, “You stand over there; I and Jonathan my son will stand over here.”“Do what seems best to you,” they replied."
"8356","1 Samuel","14","41","Then Saul prayed to the Lord, the God of Israel, “Why have you not answered your servant today? If the fault is in me or my son Jonathan, respond with Urim, but if the men of Israel are at fault,14:41 Septuagint; Hebrew does not have “Why… at fault. respond with Thummim.” Jonathan and Saul were taken by lot, and the men were cleared. "
"8357","1 Samuel","14","42","Saul said, “Cast the lot between me and Jonathan my son.” And Jonathan was taken."
"8358","1 Samuel","14","43","Then Saul said to Jonathan, “Tell me what you have done.”So Jonathan told him, “I tasted a little honey with the end of my staff. And now I must die!”"
"8359","1 Samuel","14","44","Saul said, “May God deal with me, be it ever so severely, if you do not die, Jonathan.”"
"8360","1 Samuel","14","45","But the men said to Saul, “Should Jonathan die—he who has brought about this great deliverance in Israel? Never! As surely as the Lord lives, not a hair of his head will fall to the ground, for he did this today with God’s help.” So the men rescued Jonathan, and he was not put to death."
"8361","1 Samuel","14","46","Then Saul stopped pursuing the Philistines, and they withdrew to their own land."
"8362","1 Samuel","14","47","After Saul had assumed rule over Israel, he fought against their enemies on every side: Moab, the Ammonites, Edom, the kings14:47 Masoretic Text; Dead Sea Scrolls and Septuagint king of Zobah, and the Philistines. Wherever he turned, he inflicted punishment on them.14:47 Hebrew; Septuagint he was victorious "
"8363","1 Samuel","14","48","He fought valiantly and defeated the Amalekites, delivering Israel from the hands of those who had plundered them.Saul’s Family"
"8364","1 Samuel","14","49","Saul’s sons were Jonathan, Ishvi and Malki-Shua. The name of his older daughter was Merab, and that of the younger was Michal. "
"8365","1 Samuel","14","50","His wife’s name was Ahinoam daughter of Ahimaaz. The name of the commander of Saul’s army was Abner son of Ner, and Ner was Saul’s uncle. "
"8366","1 Samuel","14","51","Saul’s father Kish and Abner’s father Ner were sons of Abiel."
"8367","1 Samuel","14","52","All the days of Saul there was bitter war with the Philistines, and whenever Saul saw a mighty or brave man, he took him into his service."
"8368","1 Samuel","15","1","Samuel said to Saul, “I am the one the Lord sent to anoint you king over his people Israel; so listen now to the message from the Lord. "
"8369","1 Samuel","15","2","This is what the Lord Almighty says: ‘I will punish the Amalekites for what they did to Israel when they waylaid them as they came up from Egypt. "
"8370","1 Samuel","15","3","Now go, attack the Amalekites and totally destroy15:3 The Hebrew term refers to the irrevocable giving over of things or persons to the Lord, often by totally destroying them; also in verses 8, 9, 15, 18, 20 and 21. all that belongs to them. Do not spare them; put to death men and women, children and infants, cattle and sheep, camels and donkeys.’ ”"
"8371","1 Samuel","15","4","So Saul summoned the men and mustered them at Telaim—two hundred thousand foot soldiers and ten thousand from Judah. "
"8372","1 Samuel","15","5","Saul went to the city of Amalek and set an ambush in the ravine. "
"8373","1 Samuel","15","6","Then he said to the Kenites, “Go away, leave the Amalekites so that I do not destroy you along with them; for you showed kindness to all the Israelites when they came up out of Egypt.” So the Kenites moved away from the Amalekites."
"8374","1 Samuel","15","7","Then Saul attacked the Amalekites all the way from Havilah to Shur, near the eastern border of Egypt. "
"8375","1 Samuel","15","8","He took Agag king of the Amalekites alive, and all his people he totally destroyed with the sword. "
"8376","1 Samuel","15","9","But Saul and the army spared Agag and the best of the sheep and cattle, the fat calves15:9 Or the grown bulls; the meaning of the Hebrew for this phrase is uncertain. and lambs—everything that was good. These they were unwilling to destroy completely, but everything that was despised and weak they totally destroyed."
"8377","1 Samuel","15","10","Then the word of the Lord came to Samuel:  "
"8378","1 Samuel","15","11","""I regret that I have made Saul king, because he has turned away from me and has not carried out my instructions.” Samuel was angry, and he cried out to the Lord all that night."
"8379","1 Samuel","15","12","Early in the morning Samuel got up and went to meet Saul, but he was told, “Saul has gone to Carmel. There he has set up a monument in his own honor and has turned and gone on down to Gilgal.”"
"8380","1 Samuel","15","13","When Samuel reached him, Saul said, “The Lord bless you! I have carried out the Lord’s instructions.”"
"8381","1 Samuel","15","14","But Samuel said, “What then is this bleating of sheep in my ears? What is this lowing of cattle that I hear?”"
"8382","1 Samuel","15","15","Saul answered, “The soldiers brought them from the Amalekites; they spared the best of the sheep and cattle to sacrifice to the Lord your God, but we totally destroyed the rest.” "
"8383","1 Samuel","15","16","""Enough!” Samuel said to Saul. “Let me tell you what the Lord said to me last night.”“Tell me,” Saul replied."
"8384","1 Samuel","15","17","Samuel said, “Although you were once small in your own eyes, did you not become the head of the tribes of Israel? The Lord anointed you king over Israel. "
"8385","1 Samuel","15","18","And he sent you on a mission, saying, ‘Go and completely destroy those wicked people, the Amalekites; wage war against them until you have wiped them out.’ "
"8386","1 Samuel","15","19","Why did you not obey the Lord? Why did you pounce on the plunder and do evil in the eyes of the Lord?” "
"8387","1 Samuel","15","20","""But I did obey the Lord,” Saul said. “I went on the mission the Lord assigned me. I completely destroyed the Amalekites and brought back Agag their king. "
"8388","1 Samuel","15","21","The soldiers took sheep and cattle from the plunder, the best of what was devoted to God, in order to sacrifice them to the Lord your God at Gilgal.”"
"8389","1 Samuel","15","22","But Samuel replied:“Does the Lord delight in burnt offerings and sacrificesas much as in obeying the Lord?To obey is better than sacrifice,and to heed is better than the fat of rams."
"8390","1 Samuel","15","23","For rebellion is like the sin of divination,and arrogance like the evil of idolatry.Because you have rejected the word of the Lord,he has rejected you as king.”"
"8391","1 Samuel","15","24","Then Saul said to Samuel, “I have sinned. I violated the Lord’s command and your instructions. I was afraid of the men and so I gave in to them. "
"8392","1 Samuel","15","25","Now I beg you, forgive my sin and come back with me, so that I may worship the Lord.”"
"8393","1 Samuel","15","26","But Samuel said to him, “I will not go back with you. You have rejected the word of the Lord, and the Lord has rejected you as king over Israel!”"
"8394","1 Samuel","15","27","As Samuel turned to leave, Saul caught hold of the hem of his robe, and it tore. "
"8395","1 Samuel","15","28","Samuel said to him, “The Lord has torn the kingdom of Israel from you today and has given it to one of your neighbors—to one better than you. "
"8396","1 Samuel","15","29","He who is the Glory of Israel does not lie or change his mind; for he is not a human being, that he should change his mind.”"
"8397","1 Samuel","15","30","Saul replied, “I have sinned. But please honor me before the elders of my people and before Israel; come back with me, so that I may worship the Lord your God.” "
"8398","1 Samuel","15","31","So Samuel went back with Saul, and Saul worshiped the Lord."
"8399","1 Samuel","15","32","Then Samuel said, “Bring me Agag king of the Amalekites.”Agag came to him in chains.15:32 The meaning of the Hebrew for this phrase is uncertain. And he thought, “Surely the bitterness of death is past.”"
"8400","1 Samuel","15","33","But Samuel said,“As your sword has made women childless,so will your mother be childless among women.”And Samuel put Agag to death before the Lord at Gilgal."
"8401","1 Samuel","15","34","Then Samuel left for Ramah, but Saul went up to his home in Gibeah of Saul. "
"8402","1 Samuel","15","35","Until the day Samuel died, he did not go to see Saul again, though Samuel mourned for him. And the Lord regretted that he had made Saul king over Israel."
"8403","1 Samuel","16","1","The Lord said to Samuel, “How long will you mourn for Saul, since I have rejected him as king over Israel? Fill your horn with oil and be on your way; I am sending you to Jesse of Bethlehem. I have chosen one of his sons to be king.”"
"8404","1 Samuel","16","2","But Samuel said, “How can I go? If Saul hears about it, he will kill me.”The Lord said, “Take a heifer with you and say, ‘I have come to sacrifice to the Lord.’ "
"8405","1 Samuel","16","3","Invite Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show you what to do. You are to anoint for me the one I indicate.”"
"8406","1 Samuel","16","4","Samuel did what the Lord said. When he arrived at Bethlehem, the elders of the town trembled when they met him. They asked, “Do you come in peace?”"
"8407","1 Samuel","16","5","Samuel replied, “Yes, in peace; I have come to sacrifice to the Lord. Consecrate yourselves and come to the sacrifice with me.” Then he consecrated Jesse and his sons and invited them to the sacrifice."
"8408","1 Samuel","16","6","When they arrived, Samuel saw Eliab and thought, “Surely the Lord’s anointed stands here before the Lord.”"
"8409","1 Samuel","16","7","But the Lord said to Samuel, “Do not consider his appearance or his height, for I have rejected him. The Lord does not look at the things people look at. People look at the outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart.”"
"8410","1 Samuel","16","8","Then Jesse called Abinadab and had him pass in front of Samuel. But Samuel said, “The Lord has not chosen this one either.” "
"8411","1 Samuel","16","9","Jesse then had Shammah pass by, but Samuel said, “Nor has the Lord chosen this one.” "
"8412","1 Samuel","16","10","Jesse had seven of his sons pass before Samuel, but Samuel said to him, “The Lord has not chosen these.” "
"8413","1 Samuel","16","11","So he asked Jesse, “Are these all the sons you have?”“There is still the youngest,” Jesse answered. “He is tending the sheep.”Samuel said, “Send for him; we will not sit down until he arrives.”"
"8414","1 Samuel","16","12","So he sent for him and had him brought in. He was glowing with health and had a fine appearance and handsome features.Then the Lord said, “Rise and anoint him; this is the one.”"
"8415","1 Samuel","16","13","So Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the presence of his brothers, and from that day on the Spirit of the Lord came powerfully upon David. Samuel then went to Ramah.David in Saul’s Service"
"8416","1 Samuel","16","14","Now the Spirit of the Lord had departed from Saul, and an evil16:14 Or and a harmful; similarly in verses 15, 16 and 23 spirit from the Lord tormented him."
"8417","1 Samuel","16","15","Saul’s attendants said to him, “See, an evil spirit from God is tormenting you. "
"8418","1 Samuel","16","16","Let our lord command his servants here to search for someone who can play the lyre. He will play when the evil spirit from God comes on you, and you will feel better.”"
"8419","1 Samuel","16","17","So Saul said to his attendants, “Find someone who plays well and bring him to me.”"
"8420","1 Samuel","16","18","One of the servants answered, “I have seen a son of Jesse of Bethlehem who knows how to play the lyre. He is a brave man and a warrior. He speaks well and is a fine-looking man. And the Lord is with him.”"
"8421","1 Samuel","16","19","Then Saul sent messengers to Jesse and said, “Send me your son David, who is with the sheep.” "
"8422","1 Samuel","16","20","So Jesse took a donkey loaded with bread, a skin of wine and a young goat and sent them with his son David to Saul."
"8423","1 Samuel","16","21","David came to Saul and entered his service. Saul liked him very much, and David became one of his armor-bearers. "
"8424","1 Samuel","16","22","Then Saul sent word to Jesse, saying, “Allow David to remain in my service, for I am pleased with him.”"
"8425","1 Samuel","16","23","Whenever the spirit from God came on Saul, David would take up his lyre and play. Then relief would come to Saul; he would feel better, and the evil spirit would leave him."
"8426","1 Samuel","17","1","Now the Philistines gathered their forces for war and assembled at Sokoh in Judah. They pitched camp at Ephes Dammim, between Sokoh and Azekah. "
"8427","1 Samuel","17","2","Saul and the Israelites assembled and camped in the Valley of Elah and drew up their battle line to meet the Philistines. "
"8428","1 Samuel","17","3","The Philistines occupied one hill and the Israelites another, with the valley between them."
"8429","1 Samuel","17","4","A champion named Goliath, who was from Gath, came out of the Philistine camp. His height was six cubits and a span.17:4 That is, about 9 feet 9 inches or about 3 meters "
"8430","1 Samuel","17","5","He had a bronze helmet on his head and wore a coat of scale armor of bronze weighing five thousand shekels17:5 That is, about 125 pounds or about 58 kilograms; "
"8431","1 Samuel","17","6","on his legs he wore bronze greaves, and a bronze javelin was slung on his back. "
"8432","1 Samuel","17","7","His spear shaft was like a weaver’s rod, and its iron point weighed six hundred shekels.17:7 That is, about 15 pounds or about 6.9 kilograms His shield bearer went ahead of him."
"8433","1 Samuel","17","8","Goliath stood and shouted to the ranks of Israel, “Why do you come out and line up for battle? Am I not a Philistine, and are you not the servants of Saul? Choose a man and have him come down to me. "
"8434","1 Samuel","17","9","If he is able to fight and kill me, we will become your subjects; but if I overcome him and kill him, you will become our subjects and serve us.” "
"8435","1 Samuel","17","10","Then the Philistine said, “This day I defy the armies of Israel! Give me a man and let us fight each other.” "
"8436","1 Samuel","17","11","On hearing the Philistine’s words, Saul and all the Israelites were dismayed and terrified."
"8437","1 Samuel","17","12","Now David was the son of an Ephrathite named Jesse, who was from Bethlehem in Judah. Jesse had eight sons, and in Saul’s time he was very old. "
"8438","1 Samuel","17","13","Jesse’s three oldest sons had followed Saul to the war: The firstborn was Eliab; the second, Abinadab; and the third, Shammah. "
"8439","1 Samuel","17","14","David was the youngest. The three oldest followed Saul, "
"8440","1 Samuel","17","15","but David went back and forth from Saul to tend his father’s sheep at Bethlehem."
"8441","1 Samuel","17","16","For forty days the Philistine came forward every morning and evening and took his stand."
"8442","1 Samuel","17","17","Now Jesse said to his son David, “Take this ephah17:17 That is, probably about 36 pounds or about 16 kilograms of roasted grain and these ten loaves of bread for your brothers and hurry to their camp. "
"8443","1 Samuel","17","18","Take along these ten cheeses to the commander of their unit. See how your brothers are and bring back some assurance17:18 Or some token; or some pledge of spoils from them. "
"8444","1 Samuel","17","19","They are with Saul and all the men of Israel in the Valley of Elah, fighting against the Philistines.”"
"8445","1 Samuel","17","20","Early in the morning David left the flock in the care of a shepherd, loaded up and set out, as Jesse had directed. He reached the camp as the army was going out to its battle positions, shouting the war cry. "
"8446","1 Samuel","17","21","Israel and the Philistines were drawing up their lines facing each other. "
"8447","1 Samuel","17","22","David left his things with the keeper of supplies, ran to the battle lines and asked his brothers how they were. "
"8448","1 Samuel","17","23","As he was talking with them, Goliath, the Philistine champion from Gath, stepped out from his lines and shouted his usual defiance, and David heard it. "
"8449","1 Samuel","17","24","Whenever the Israelites saw the man, they all fled from him in great fear."
"8450","1 Samuel","17","25","Now the Israelites had been saying, “Do you see how this man keeps coming out? He comes out to defy Israel. The king will give great wealth to the man who kills him. He will also give him his daughter in marriage and will exempt his family from taxes in Israel.”"
"8451","1 Samuel","17","26","David asked the men standing near him, “What will be done for the man who kills this Philistine and removes this disgrace from Israel? Who is this uncircumcised Philistine that he should defy the armies of the living God?”"
"8452","1 Samuel","17","27","They repeated to him what they had been saying and told him, “This is what will be done for the man who kills him.”"
"8453","1 Samuel","17","28","When Eliab, David’s oldest brother, heard him speaking with the men, he burned with anger at him and asked, “Why have you come down here? And with whom did you leave those few sheep in the wilderness? I know how conceited you are and how wicked your heart is; you came down only to watch the battle.” "
"8454","1 Samuel","17","29","""Now what have I done?” said David. “Can’t I even speak?” "
"8455","1 Samuel","17","30","He then turned away to someone else and brought up the same matter, and the men answered him as before. "
"8456","1 Samuel","17","31","What David said was overheard and reported to Saul, and Saul sent for him."
"8457","1 Samuel","17","32","David said to Saul, “Let no one lose heart on account of this Philistine; your servant will go and fight him.”"
"8458","1 Samuel","17","33","Saul replied, “You are not able to go out against this Philistine and fight him; you are only a young man, and he has been a warrior from his youth.”"
"8459","1 Samuel","17","34","But David said to Saul, “Your servant has been keeping his father’s sheep. When a lion or a bear came and carried off a sheep from the flock, "
"8460","1 Samuel","17","35","I went after it, struck it and rescued the sheep from its mouth. When it turned on me, I seized it by its hair, struck it and killed it. "
"8461","1 Samuel","17","36","Your servant has killed both the lion and the bear; this uncircumcised Philistine will be like one of them, because he has defied the armies of the living God. "
"8462","1 Samuel","17","37","The Lord who rescued me from the paw of the lion and the paw of the bear will rescue me from the hand of this Philistine.”Saul said to David, “Go, and the Lord be with you.”"
"8463","1 Samuel","17","38","Then Saul dressed David in his own tunic. He put a coat of armor on him and a bronze helmet on his head. "
"8464","1 Samuel","17","39","David fastened on his sword over the tunic and tried walking around, because he was not used to them.“I cannot go in these,” he said to Saul, “because I am not used to them.” So he took them off. "
"8465","1 Samuel","17","40","Then he took his staff in his hand, chose five smooth stones from the stream, put them in the pouch of his shepherd’s bag and, with his sling in his hand, approached the Philistine."
"8466","1 Samuel","17","41","Meanwhile, the Philistine, with his shield bearer in front of him, kept coming closer to David. "
"8467","1 Samuel","17","42","He looked David over and saw that he was little more than a boy, glowing with health and handsome, and he despised him. "
"8468","1 Samuel","17","43","He said to David, “Am I a dog, that you come at me with sticks?” And the Philistine cursed David by his gods.  "
"8469","1 Samuel","17","44","""Come here,” he said, “and I’ll give your flesh to the birds and the wild animals!”"
"8470","1 Samuel","17","45","David said to the Philistine, “You come against me with sword and spear and javelin, but I come against you in the name of the Lord Almighty, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied. "
"8471","1 Samuel","17","46","This day the Lord will deliver you into my hands, and I’ll strike you down and cut off your head. This very day I will give the carcasses of the Philistine army to the birds and the wild animals, and the whole world will know that there is a God in Israel. "
"8472","1 Samuel","17","47","All those gathered here will know that it is not by sword or spear that the Lord saves; for the battle is the Lord’s, and he will give all of you into our hands.”"
"8473","1 Samuel","17","48","As the Philistine moved closer to attack him, David ran quickly toward the battle line to meet him. "
"8474","1 Samuel","17","49","Reaching into his bag and taking out a stone, he slung it and struck the Philistine on the forehead. The stone sank into his forehead, and he fell facedown on the ground."
"8475","1 Samuel","17","50","So David triumphed over the Philistine with a sling and a stone; without a sword in his hand he struck down the Philistine and killed him."
"8476","1 Samuel","17","51","David ran and stood over him. He took hold of the Philistine’s sword and drew it from the sheath. After he killed him, he cut off his head with the sword.When the Philistines saw that their hero was dead, they turned and ran. "
"8477","1 Samuel","17","52","Then the men of Israel and Judah surged forward with a shout and pursued the Philistines to the entrance of Gath17:52 Some Septuagint manuscripts; Hebrew of a valley and to the gates of Ekron. Their dead were strewn along the Shaaraim road to Gath and Ekron. "
"8478","1 Samuel","17","53","When the Israelites returned from chasing the Philistines, they plundered their camp."
"8479","1 Samuel","17","54","David took the Philistine’s head and brought it to Jerusalem; he put the Philistine’s weapons in his own tent."
"8480","1 Samuel","17","55","As Saul watched David going out to meet the Philistine, he said to Abner, commander of the army, “Abner, whose son is that young man?”Abner replied, “As surely as you live, Your Majesty, I don’t know.”"
"8481","1 Samuel","17","56","The king said, “Find out whose son this young man is.”"
"8482","1 Samuel","17","57","As soon as David returned from killing the Philistine, Abner took him and brought him before Saul, with David still holding the Philistine’s head. "
"8483","1 Samuel","17","58","""Whose son are you, young man?” Saul asked him.David said, “I am the son of your servant Jesse of Bethlehem.”"
"8484","1 Samuel","18","1","After David had finished talking with Saul, Jonathan became one in spirit with David, and he loved him as himself. "
"8485","1 Samuel","18","2","From that day Saul kept David with him and did not let him return home to his family. "
"8486","1 Samuel","18","3","And Jonathan made a covenant with David because he loved him as himself. "
"8487","1 Samuel","18","4","Jonathan took off the robe he was wearing and gave it to David, along with his tunic, and even his sword, his bow and his belt."
"8488","1 Samuel","18","5","Whatever mission Saul sent him on, David was so successful that Saul gave him a high rank in the army. This pleased all the troops, and Saul’s officers as well."
"8489","1 Samuel","18","6","When the men were returning home after David had killed the Philistine, the women came out from all the towns of Israel to meet King Saul with singing and dancing, with joyful songs and with timbrels and lyres. "
"8490","1 Samuel","18","7","As they danced, they sang:“Saul has slain his thousands,and David his tens of thousands.”"
"8491","1 Samuel","18","8","Saul was very angry; this refrain displeased him greatly. “They have credited David with tens of thousands,” he thought, “but me with only thousands. What more can he get but the kingdom?” "
"8492","1 Samuel","18","9","And from that time on Saul kept a close eye on David."
"8493","1 Samuel","18","10","The next day an evil18:10 Or a harmful spirit from God came forcefully on Saul. He was prophesying in his house, while David was playing the lyre, as he usually did. Saul had a spear in his hand "
"8494","1 Samuel","18","11","and he hurled it, saying to himself, “I’ll pin David to the wall.” But David eluded him twice."
"8495","1 Samuel","18","12","Saul was afraid of David, because the Lord was with David but had departed from Saul. "
"8496","1 Samuel","18","13","So he sent David away from him and gave him command over a thousand men, and David led the troops in their campaigns. "
"8497","1 Samuel","18","14","In everything he did he had great success, because the Lord was with him. "
"8498","1 Samuel","18","15","When Saul saw how successful he was, he was afraid of him. "
"8499","1 Samuel","18","16","But all Israel and Judah loved David, because he led them in their campaigns."
"8500","1 Samuel","18","17","Saul said to David, “Here is my older daughter Merab. I will give her to you in marriage; only serve me bravely and fight the battles of the Lord.” For Saul said to himself, “I will not raise a hand against him. Let the Philistines do that!”"
"8501","1 Samuel","18","18","But David said to Saul, “Who am I, and what is my family or my clan in Israel, that I should become the king’s son-in-law?” "
"8502","1 Samuel","18","19","So18:19 Or However, when the time came for Merab, Saul’s daughter, to be given to David, she was given in marriage to Adriel of Meholah."
"8503","1 Samuel","18","20","Now Saul’s daughter Michal was in love with David, and when they told Saul about it, he was pleased.  "
"8504","1 Samuel","18","21","""I will give her to him,” he thought, “so that she may be a snare to him and so that the hand of the Philistines may be against him.” So Saul said to David, “Now you have a second opportunity to become my son-in-law.”"
"8505","1 Samuel","18","22","Then Saul ordered his attendants: “Speak to David privately and say, ‘Look, the king likes you, and his attendants all love you; now become his son-in-law.’ ”"
"8506","1 Samuel","18","23","They repeated these words to David. But David said, “Do you think it is a small matter to become the king’s son-in-law? I’m only a poor man and little known.”"
"8507","1 Samuel","18","24","When Saul’s servants told him what David had said, "
"8508","1 Samuel","18","25","Saul replied, “Say to David, ‘The king wants no other price for the bride than a hundred Philistine foreskins, to take revenge on his enemies.’ ” Saul’s plan was to have David fall by the hands of the Philistines."
"8509","1 Samuel","18","26","When the attendants told David these things, he was pleased to become the king’s son-in-law. So before the allotted time elapsed, "
"8510","1 Samuel","18","27","David took his men with him and went out and killed two hundred Philistines and brought back their foreskins. They counted out the full number to the king so that David might become the king’s son-in-law. Then Saul gave him his daughter Michal in marriage."
"8511","1 Samuel","18","28","When Saul realized that the Lord was with David and that his daughter Michal loved David, "
"8512","1 Samuel","18","29","Saul became still more afraid of him, and he remained his enemy the rest of his days."
"8513","1 Samuel","18","30","The Philistine commanders continued to go out to battle, and as often as they did, David met with more success than the rest of Saul’s officers, and his name became well known."
"8514","1 Samuel","19","1","Saul told his son Jonathan and all the attendants to kill David. But Jonathan had taken a great liking to David "
"8515","1 Samuel","19","2","and warned him, “My father Saul is looking for a chance to kill you. Be on your guard tomorrow morning; go into hiding and stay there. "
"8516","1 Samuel","19","3","I will go out and stand with my father in the field where you are. I’ll speak to him about you and will tell you what I find out.”"
"8517","1 Samuel","19","4","Jonathan spoke well of David to Saul his father and said to him, “Let not the king do wrong to his servant David; he has not wronged you, and what he has done has benefited you greatly. "
"8518","1 Samuel","19","5","He took his life in his hands when he killed the Philistine. The Lord won a great victory for all Israel, and you saw it and were glad. Why then would you do wrong to an innocent man like David by killing him for no reason?”"
"8519","1 Samuel","19","6","Saul listened to Jonathan and took this oath: “As surely as the Lord lives, David will not be put to death.”"
"8520","1 Samuel","19","7","So Jonathan called David and told him the whole conversation. He brought him to Saul, and David was with Saul as before."
"8521","1 Samuel","19","8","Once more war broke out, and David went out and fought the Philistines. He struck them with such force that they fled before him."
"8522","1 Samuel","19","9","But an evil19:9 Or But a harmful spirit from the Lord came on Saul as he was sitting in his house with his spear in his hand. While David was playing the lyre, "
"8523","1 Samuel","19","10","Saul tried to pin him to the wall with his spear, but David eluded him as Saul drove the spear into the wall. That night David made good his escape."
"8524","1 Samuel","19","11","Saul sent men to David’s house to watch it and to kill him in the morning. But Michal, David’s wife, warned him, “If you don’t run for your life tonight, tomorrow you’ll be killed.” "
"8525","1 Samuel","19","12","So Michal let David down through a window, and he fled and escaped. "
"8526","1 Samuel","19","13","Then Michal took an idol and laid it on the bed, covering it with a garment and putting some goats’ hair at the head."
"8527","1 Samuel","19","14","When Saul sent the men to capture David, Michal said, “He is ill.”"
"8528","1 Samuel","19","15","Then Saul sent the men back to see David and told them, “Bring him up to me in his bed so that I may kill him.” "
"8529","1 Samuel","19","16","But when the men entered, there was the idol in the bed, and at the head was some goats’ hair."
"8530","1 Samuel","19","17","Saul said to Michal, “Why did you deceive me like this and send my enemy away so that he escaped?”Michal told him, “He said to me, ‘Let me get away. Why should I kill you?’ ”"
"8531","1 Samuel","19","18","When David had fled and made his escape, he went to Samuel at Ramah and told him all that Saul had done to him. Then he and Samuel went to Naioth and stayed there. "
"8532","1 Samuel","19","19","Word came to Saul: “David is in Naioth at Ramah”; "
"8533","1 Samuel","19","20","so he sent men to capture him. But when they saw a group of prophets prophesying, with Samuel standing there as their leader, the Spirit of God came on Saul’s men, and they also prophesied. "
"8534","1 Samuel","19","21","Saul was told about it, and he sent more men, and they prophesied too. Saul sent men a third time, and they also prophesied. "
"8535","1 Samuel","19","22","Finally, he himself left for Ramah and went to the great cistern at Seku. And he asked, “Where are Samuel and David?”“Over in Naioth at Ramah,” they said."
"8536","1 Samuel","19","23","So Saul went to Naioth at Ramah. But the Spirit of God came even on him, and he walked along prophesying until he came to Naioth. "
"8537","1 Samuel","19","24","He stripped off his garments, and he too prophesied in Samuel’s presence. He lay naked all that day and all that night. This is why people say, “Is Saul also among the prophets?”"
"8538","1 Samuel","20","1","Then David fled from Naioth at Ramah and went to Jonathan and asked, “What have I done? What is my crime? How have I wronged your father, that he is trying to kill me?” "
"8539","1 Samuel","20","2","""Never!” Jonathan replied. “You are not going to die! Look, my father doesn’t do anything, great or small, without letting me know. Why would he hide this from me? It isn’t so!”"
"8540","1 Samuel","20","3","But David took an oath and said, “Your father knows very well that I have found favor in your eyes, and he has said to himself, ‘Jonathan must not know this or he will be grieved.’ Yet as surely as the Lord lives and as you live, there is only a step between me and death.”"
"8541","1 Samuel","20","4","Jonathan said to David, “Whatever you want me to do, I’ll do for you.”"
"8542","1 Samuel","20","5","So David said, “Look, tomorrow is the New Moon feast, and I am supposed to dine with the king; but let me go and hide in the field until the evening of the day after tomorrow. "
"8543","1 Samuel","20","6","If your father misses me at all, tell him, ‘David earnestly asked my permission to hurry to Bethlehem, his hometown, because an annual sacrifice is being made there for his whole clan.’ "
"8544","1 Samuel","20","7","If he says, ‘Very well,’ then your servant is safe. But if he loses his temper, you can be sure that he is determined to harm me. "
"8545","1 Samuel","20","8","As for you, show kindness to your servant, for you have brought him into a covenant with you before the Lord. If I am guilty, then kill me yourself! Why hand me over to your father?” "
"8546","1 Samuel","20","9","""Never!” Jonathan said. “If I had the least inkling that my father was determined to harm you, wouldn’t I tell you?”"
"8547","1 Samuel","20","10","David asked, “Who will tell me if your father answers you harshly?” "
"8548","1 Samuel","20","11","""Come,” Jonathan said, “let’s go out into the field.” So they went there together."
"8549","1 Samuel","20","12","Then Jonathan said to David, “I swear by the Lord, the God of Israel, that I will surely sound out my father by this time the day after tomorrow! If he is favorably disposed toward you, will I not send you word and let you know? "
"8550","1 Samuel","20","13","But if my father intends to harm you, may the Lord deal with Jonathan, be it ever so severely, if I do not let you know and send you away in peace. May the Lord be with you as he has been with my father. "
"8551","1 Samuel","20","14","But show me unfailing kindness like the Lord’s kindness as long as I live, so that I may not be killed, "
"8552","1 Samuel","20","15","and do not ever cut off your kindness from my family—not even when the Lord has cut off every one of David’s enemies from the face of the earth.”"
"8553","1 Samuel","20","16","So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, “May the Lord call David’s enemies to account.” "
"8554","1 Samuel","20","17","And Jonathan had David reaffirm his oath out of love for him, because he loved him as he loved himself."
"8555","1 Samuel","20","18","Then Jonathan said to David, “Tomorrow is the New Moon feast. You will be missed, because your seat will be empty. "
"8556","1 Samuel","20","19","The day after tomorrow, toward evening, go to the place where you hid when this trouble began, and wait by the stone Ezel. "
"8557","1 Samuel","20","20","I will shoot three arrows to the side of it, as though I were shooting at a target. "
"8558","1 Samuel","20","21","Then I will send a boy and say, ‘Go, find the arrows.’ If I say to him, ‘Look, the arrows are on this side of you; bring them here,’ then come, because, as surely as the Lord lives, you are safe; there is no danger. "
"8559","1 Samuel","20","22","But if I say to the boy, ‘Look, the arrows are beyond you,’ then you must go, because the Lord has sent you away. "
"8560","1 Samuel","20","23","And about the matter you and I discussed—remember, the Lord is witness between you and me forever.”"
"8561","1 Samuel","20","24","So David hid in the field, and when the New Moon feast came, the king sat down to eat. "
"8562","1 Samuel","20","25","He sat in his customary place by the wall, opposite Jonathan,20:25 Septuagint; Hebrew wall. Jonathan arose and Abner sat next to Saul, but David’s place was empty. "
"8563","1 Samuel","20","26","Saul said nothing that day, for he thought, “Something must have happened to David to make him ceremonially unclean—surely he is unclean.” "
"8564","1 Samuel","20","27","But the next day, the second day of the month, David’s place was empty again. Then Saul said to his son Jonathan, “Why hasn’t the son of Jesse come to the meal, either yesterday or today?”"
"8565","1 Samuel","20","28","Jonathan answered, “David earnestly asked me for permission to go to Bethlehem. "
"8566","1 Samuel","20","29","He said, ‘Let me go, because our family is observing a sacrifice in the town and my brother has ordered me to be there. If I have found favor in your eyes, let me get away to see my brothers.’ That is why he has not come to the king’s table.”"
"8567","1 Samuel","20","30","Saul’s anger flared up at Jonathan and he said to him, “You son of a perverse and rebellious woman! Don’t I know that you have sided with the son of Jesse to your own shame and to the shame of the mother who bore you? "
"8568","1 Samuel","20","31","As long as the son of Jesse lives on this earth, neither you nor your kingdom will be established. Now send someone to bring him to me, for he must die!” "
"8569","1 Samuel","20","32","""Why should he be put to death? What has he done?” Jonathan asked his father. "
"8570","1 Samuel","20","33","But Saul hurled his spear at him to kill him. Then Jonathan knew that his father intended to kill David."
"8571","1 Samuel","20","34","Jonathan got up from the table in fierce anger; on that second day of the feast he did not eat, because he was grieved at his father’s shameful treatment of David."
"8572","1 Samuel","20","35","In the morning Jonathan went out to the field for his meeting with David. He had a small boy with him, "
"8573","1 Samuel","20","36","and he said to the boy, “Run and find the arrows I shoot.” As the boy ran, he shot an arrow beyond him. "
"8574","1 Samuel","20","37","When the boy came to the place where Jonathan’s arrow had fallen, Jonathan called out after him, “Isn’t the arrow beyond you?” "
"8575","1 Samuel","20","38","Then he shouted, “Hurry! Go quickly! Don’t stop!” The boy picked up the arrow and returned to his master. 39(The boy knew nothing about all this; only Jonathan and David knew.) "
"8576","1 Samuel","20","40","Then Jonathan gave his weapons to the boy and said, “Go, carry them back to town.”"
"8577","1 Samuel","20","41","After the boy had gone, David got up from the south side of the stone and bowed down before Jonathan three times, with his face to the ground. Then they kissed each other and wept together—but David wept the most."
"8578","1 Samuel","20","42","Jonathan said to David, “Go in peace, for we have sworn friendship with each other in the name of the Lord, saying, ‘The Lord is witness between you and me, and between your descendants and my descendants forever.’ ” Then David left, and Jonathan went back to the town.20:42 In Hebrew texts this sentence (20:"
"8579","1 Samuel","20","42","b) is numbered 21:1."
"8580","1 Samuel","21","1","David went to Nob, to Ahimelek the priest. Ahimelek trembled when he met him, and asked, “Why are you alone? Why is no one with you?”"
"8581","1 Samuel","21","2","David answered Ahimelek the priest, “The king sent me on a mission and said to me, ‘No one is to know anything about the mission I am sending you on.’ As for my men, I have told them to meet me at a certain place. "
"8582","1 Samuel","21","3","Now then, what do you have on hand? Give me five loaves of bread, or whatever you can find.”"
"8583","1 Samuel","21","4","But the priest answered David, “I don’t have any ordinary bread on hand; however, there is some consecrated bread here—provided the men have kept themselves from women.”"
"8584","1 Samuel","21","5","David replied, “Indeed women have been kept from us, as usual whenever21:5 Or from us in the past few days since I set out. The men’s bodies are holy even on missions that are not holy. How much more so today!” "
"8585","1 Samuel","21","6","So the priest gave him the consecrated bread, since there was no bread there except the bread of the Presence that had been removed from before the Lord and replaced by hot bread on the day it was taken away."
"8586","1 Samuel","21","7","Now one of Saul’s servants was there that day, detained before the Lord; he was Doeg the Edomite, Saul’s chief shepherd."
"8587","1 Samuel","21","8","David asked Ahimelek, “Don’t you have a spear or a sword here? I haven’t brought my sword or any other weapon, because the king’s mission was urgent.”"
"8588","1 Samuel","21","9","The priest replied, “The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you killed in the Valley of Elah, is here; it is wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod. If you want it, take it; there is no sword here but that one.”David said, “There is none like it; give it to me.”David at Gath"
"8589","1 Samuel","21","10","That day David fled from Saul and went to Achish king of Gath. "
"8590","1 Samuel","21","11","But the servants of Achish said to him, “Isn’t this David, the king of the land? Isn’t he the one they sing about in their dances:“ ‘Saul has slain his thousands,and David his tens of thousands’?”"
"8591","1 Samuel","21","12","David took these words to heart and was very much afraid of Achish king of Gath. "
"8592","1 Samuel","21","13","So he pretended to be insane in their presence; and while he was in their hands he acted like a madman, making marks on the doors of the gate and letting saliva run down his beard."
"8593","1 Samuel","21","14","Achish said to his servants, “Look at the man! He is insane! Why bring him to me? "
"8594","1 Samuel","21","15","Am I so short of madmen that you have to bring this fellow here to carry on like this in front of me? Must this man come into my house?”"
"8595","1 Samuel","22","1","David left Gath and escaped to the cave of Adullam. When his brothers and his father’s household heard about it, they went down to him there. "
"8596","1 Samuel","22","2","All those who were in distress or in debt or discontented gathered around him, and he became their commander. About four hundred men were with him."
"8597","1 Samuel","22","3","From there David went to Mizpah in Moab and said to the king of Moab, “Would you let my father and mother come and stay with you until I learn what God will do for me?” "
"8598","1 Samuel","22","4","So he left them with the king of Moab, and they stayed with him as long as David was in the stronghold."
"8599","1 Samuel","22","5","But the prophet Gad said to David, “Do not stay in the stronghold. Go into the land of Judah.” So David left and went to the forest of Hereth.Saul Kills the Priests of Nob"
"8600","1 Samuel","22","6","Now Saul heard that David and his men had been discovered. And Saul was seated, spear in hand, under the tamarisk tree on the hill at Gibeah, with all his officials standing at his side. "
"8601","1 Samuel","22","7","He said to them, “Listen, men of Benjamin! Will the son of Jesse give all of you fields and vineyards? Will he make all of you commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds? "
"8602","1 Samuel","22","8","Is that why you have all conspired against me? No one tells me when my son makes a covenant with the son of Jesse. None of you is concerned about me or tells me that my son has incited my servant to lie in wait for me, as he does today.”"
"8603","1 Samuel","22","9","But Doeg the Edomite, who was standing with Saul’s officials, said, “I saw the son of Jesse come to Ahimelek son of Ahitub at Nob. "
"8604","1 Samuel","22","10","Ahimelek inquired of the Lord for him; he also gave him provisions and the sword of Goliath the Philistine.”"
"8605","1 Samuel","22","11","Then the king sent for the priest Ahimelek son of Ahitub and all the men of his family, who were the priests at Nob, and they all came to the king. "
"8606","1 Samuel","22","12","Saul said, “Listen now, son of Ahitub.”“Yes, my lord,” he answered."
"8607","1 Samuel","22","13","Saul said to him, “Why have you conspired against me, you and the son of Jesse, giving him bread and a sword and inquiring of God for him, so that he has rebelled against me and lies in wait for me, as he does today?”"
"8608","1 Samuel","22","14","Ahimelek answered the king, “Who of all your servants is as loyal as David, the king’s son-in-law, captain of your bodyguard and highly respected in your household? "
"8609","1 Samuel","22","15","Was that day the first time I inquired of God for him? Of course not! Let not the king accuse your servant or any of his father’s family, for your servant knows nothing at all about this whole affair.”"
"8610","1 Samuel","22","16","But the king said, “You will surely die, Ahimelek, you and your whole family.”"
"8611","1 Samuel","22","17","Then the king ordered the guards at his side: “Turn and kill the priests of the Lord, because they too have sided with David. They knew he was fleeing, yet they did not tell me.”But the king’s officials were unwilling to raise a hand to strike the priests of the Lord."
"8612","1 Samuel","22","18","The king then ordered Doeg, “You turn and strike down the priests.” So Doeg the Edomite turned and struck them down. That day he killed eighty-five men who wore the linen ephod. "
"8613","1 Samuel","22","19","He also put to the sword Nob, the town of the priests, with its men and women, its children and infants, and its cattle, donkeys and sheep."
"8614","1 Samuel","22","20","But one son of Ahimelek son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped and fled to join David. "
"8615","1 Samuel","22","21","He told David that Saul had killed the priests of the Lord. "
"8616","1 Samuel","22","22","Then David said to Abiathar, “That day, when Doeg the Edomite was there, I knew he would be sure to tell Saul. I am responsible for the death of your whole family. "
"8617","1 Samuel","22","23","Stay with me; don’t be afraid. The man who wants to kill you is trying to kill me too. You will be safe with me.”"
"8618","1 Samuel","23","1","When David was told, “Look, the Philistines are fighting against Keilah and are looting the threshing floors,” "
"8619","1 Samuel","23","2","he inquired of the Lord, saying, “Shall I go and attack these Philistines?”The Lord answered him, “Go, attack the Philistines and save Keilah.”"
"8620","1 Samuel","23","3","But David’s men said to him, “Here in Judah we are afraid. How much more, then, if we go to Keilah against the Philistine forces!”"
"8621","1 Samuel","23","4","Once again David inquired of the Lord, and the Lord answered him, “Go down to Keilah, for I am going to give the Philistines into your hand.” "
"8622","1 Samuel","23","5","So David and his men went to Keilah, fought the Philistines and carried off their livestock. He inflicted heavy losses on the Philistines and saved the people of Keilah. 6(Now Abiathar son of Ahimelek had brought the ephod down with him when he fled to David at Keilah.)Saul Pursues David"
"8623","1 Samuel","23","7","Saul was told that David had gone to Keilah, and he said, “God has delivered him into my hands, for David has imprisoned himself by entering a town with gates and bars.” "
"8624","1 Samuel","23","8","And Saul called up all his forces for battle, to go down to Keilah to besiege David and his men."
"8625","1 Samuel","23","9","When David learned that Saul was plotting against him, he said to Abiathar the priest, “Bring the ephod.” "
"8626","1 Samuel","23","10","David said, “Lord, God of Israel, your servant has heard definitely that Saul plans to come to Keilah and destroy the town on account of me. "
"8627","1 Samuel","23","11","Will the citizens of Keilah surrender me to him? Will Saul come down, as your servant has heard? Lord, God of Israel, tell your servant.”And the Lord said, “He will.”"
"8628","1 Samuel","23","12","Again David asked, “Will the citizens of Keilah surrender me and my men to Saul?”And the Lord said, “They will.”"
"8629","1 Samuel","23","13","So David and his men, about six hundred in number, left Keilah and kept moving from place to place. When Saul was told that David had escaped from Keilah, he did not go there."
"8630","1 Samuel","23","14","David stayed in the wilderness strongholds and in the hills of the Desert of Ziph. Day after day Saul searched for him, but God did not give David into his hands."
"8631","1 Samuel","23","15","While David was at Horesh in the Desert of Ziph, he learned that23:15 Or he was afraid because Saul had come out to take his life. "
"8632","1 Samuel","23","16","And Saul’s son Jonathan went to David at Horesh and helped him find strength in God.  "
"8633","1 Samuel","23","17","""Don’t be afraid,” he said. “My father Saul will not lay a hand on you. You will be king over Israel, and I will be second to you. Even my father Saul knows this.” "
"8634","1 Samuel","23","18","The two of them made a covenant before the Lord. Then Jonathan went home, but David remained at Horesh."
"8635","1 Samuel","23","19","The Ziphites went up to Saul at Gibeah and said, “Is not David hiding among us in the strongholds at Horesh, on the hill of Hakilah, south of Jeshimon? "
"8636","1 Samuel","23","20","Now, Your Majesty, come down whenever it pleases you to do so, and we will be responsible for giving him into your hands.”"
"8637","1 Samuel","23","21","Saul replied, “The Lord bless you for your concern for me. "
"8638","1 Samuel","23","22","Go and get more information. Find out where David usually goes and who has seen him there. They tell me he is very crafty. "
"8639","1 Samuel","23","23","Find out about all the hiding places he uses and come back to me with definite information. Then I will go with you; if he is in the area, I will track him down among all the clans of Judah.”"
"8640","1 Samuel","23","24","So they set out and went to Ziph ahead of Saul. Now David and his men were in the Desert of Maon, in the Arabah south of Jeshimon. "
"8641","1 Samuel","23","25","Saul and his men began the search, and when David was told about it, he went down to the rock and stayed in the Desert of Maon. When Saul heard this, he went into the Desert of Maon in pursuit of David."
"8642","1 Samuel","23","26","Saul was going along one side of the mountain, and David and his men were on the other side, hurrying to get away from Saul. As Saul and his forces were closing in on David and his men to capture them, "
"8643","1 Samuel","23","27","a messenger came to Saul, saying, “Come quickly! The Philistines are raiding the land.” "
"8644","1 Samuel","23","28","Then Saul broke off his pursuit of David and went to meet the Philistines. That is why they call this place Sela Hammahlekoth.23:28 Sela Hammahlekoth means rock of parting. "
"8645","1 Samuel","23","29","And David went up from there and lived in the strongholds of En Gedi.23:29 In Hebrew texts this verse (23:29) is numbered 24:1."
"8646","1 Samuel","24","1","After Saul returned from pursuing the Philistines, he was told, “David is in the Desert of En Gedi.” "
"8647","1 Samuel","24","2","So Saul took three thousand able young men from all Israel and set out to look for David and his men near the Crags of the Wild Goats."
"8648","1 Samuel","24","3","He came to the sheep pens along the way; a cave was there, and Saul went in to relieve himself. David and his men were far back in the cave. "
"8649","1 Samuel","24","4","The men said, “This is the day the Lord spoke of when he said24:4 Or “Today the Lord is saying to you, ‘I will give your enemy into your hands for you to deal with as you wish.’ ” Then David crept up unnoticed and cut off a corner of Saul’s robe."
"8650","1 Samuel","24","5","Afterward, David was conscience-stricken for having cut off a corner of his robe. "
"8651","1 Samuel","24","6","He said to his men, “The Lord forbid that I should do such a thing to my master, the Lord’s anointed, or lay my hand on him; for he is the anointed of the Lord.” "
"8652","1 Samuel","24","7","With these words David sharply rebuked his men and did not allow them to attack Saul. And Saul left the cave and went his way."
"8653","1 Samuel","24","8","Then David went out of the cave and called out to Saul, “My lord the king!” When Saul looked behind him, David bowed down and prostrated himself with his face to the ground. "
"8654","1 Samuel","24","9","He said to Saul, “Why do you listen when men say, ‘David is bent on harming you’? "
"8655","1 Samuel","24","10","This day you have seen with your own eyes how the Lord delivered you into my hands in the cave. Some urged me to kill you, but I spared you; I said, ‘I will not lay my hand on my lord, because he is the Lord’s anointed.’ "
"8656","1 Samuel","24","11","See, my father, look at this piece of your robe in my hand! I cut off the corner of your robe but did not kill you. See that there is nothing in my hand to indicate that I am guilty of wrongdoing or rebellion. I have not wronged you, but you are hunting me down to take my life. "
"8657","1 Samuel","24","12","May the Lord judge between you and me. And may the Lord avenge the wrongs you have done to me, but my hand will not touch you. "
"8658","1 Samuel","24","13","As the old saying goes, ‘From evildoers come evil deeds,’ so my hand will not touch you. "
"8659","1 Samuel","24","14","""Against whom has the king of Israel come out? Who are you pursuing? A dead dog? A flea? "
"8660","1 Samuel","24","15","May the Lord be our judge and decide between us. May he consider my cause and uphold it; may he vindicate me by delivering me from your hand.”"
"8661","1 Samuel","24","16","When David finished saying this, Saul asked, “Is that your voice, David my son?” And he wept aloud.  "
"8662","1 Samuel","24","17","""You are more righteous than I,” he said. “You have treated me well, but I have treated you badly. "
"8663","1 Samuel","24","18","You have just now told me about the good you did to me; the Lord delivered me into your hands, but you did not kill me. "
"8664","1 Samuel","24","19","When a man finds his enemy, does he let him get away unharmed? May the Lord reward you well for the way you treated me today. "
"8665","1 Samuel","24","20","I know that you will surely be king and that the kingdom of Israel will be established in your hands. "
"8666","1 Samuel","24","21","Now swear to me by the Lord that you will not kill off my descendants or wipe out my name from my father’s family.”"
"8667","1 Samuel","24","22","So David gave his oath to Saul. Then Saul returned home, but David and his men went up to the stronghold."
"8668","1 Samuel","25","1","Now Samuel died, and all Israel assembled and mourned for him; and they buried him at his home in Ramah. Then David moved down into the Desert of Paran.25:1 Hebrew and some Septuagint manuscripts; other Septuagint manuscripts Maon"
"8669","1 Samuel","25","2","A certain man in Maon, who had property there at Carmel, was very wealthy. He had a thousand goats and three thousand sheep, which he was shearing in Carmel. "
"8670","1 Samuel","25","3","His name was Nabal and his wife’s name was Abigail. She was an intelligent and beautiful woman, but her husband was surly and mean in his dealings—he was a Calebite."
"8671","1 Samuel","25","4","While David was in the wilderness, he heard that Nabal was shearing sheep. "
"8672","1 Samuel","25","5","So he sent ten young men and said to them, “Go up to Nabal at Carmel and greet him in my name. "
"8673","1 Samuel","25","6","Say to him: ‘Long life to you! Good health to you and your household! And good health to all that is yours! "
"8674","1 Samuel","25","7",""" ‘Now I hear that it is sheep-shearing time. When your shepherds were with us, we did not mistreat them, and the whole time they were at Carmel nothing of theirs was missing. "
"8675","1 Samuel","25","8","Ask your own servants and they will tell you. Therefore be favorable toward my men, since we come at a festive time. Please give your servants and your son David whatever you can find for them.’ ”"
"8676","1 Samuel","25","9","When David’s men arrived, they gave Nabal this message in David’s name. Then they waited."
"8677","1 Samuel","25","10","Nabal answered David’s servants, “Who is this David? Who is this son of Jesse? Many servants are breaking away from their masters these days. "
"8678","1 Samuel","25","11","Why should I take my bread and water, and the meat I have slaughtered for my shearers, and give it to men coming from who knows where?”"
"8679","1 Samuel","25","12","David’s men turned around and went back. When they arrived, they reported every word. "
"8680","1 Samuel","25","13","David said to his men, “Each of you strap on your sword!” So they did, and David strapped his on as well. About four hundred men went up with David, while two hundred stayed with the supplies."
"8681","1 Samuel","25","14","One of the servants told Abigail, Nabal’s wife, “David sent messengers from the wilderness to give our master his greetings, but he hurled insults at them. "
"8682","1 Samuel","25","15","Yet these men were very good to us. They did not mistreat us, and the whole time we were out in the fields near them nothing was missing. "
"8683","1 Samuel","25","16","Night and day they were a wall around us the whole time we were herding our sheep near them. "
"8684","1 Samuel","25","17","Now think it over and see what you can do, because disaster is hanging over our master and his whole household. He is such a wicked man that no one can talk to him.”"
"8685","1 Samuel","25","18","Abigail acted quickly. She took two hundred loaves of bread, two skins of wine, five dressed sheep, five seahs25:18 That is, probably about 60 pounds or about 27 kilograms of roasted grain, a hundred cakes of raisins and two hundred cakes of pressed figs, and loaded them on donkeys. "
"8686","1 Samuel","25","19","Then she told her servants, “Go on ahead; I’ll follow you.” But she did not tell her husband Nabal."
"8687","1 Samuel","25","20","As she came riding her donkey into a mountain ravine, there were David and his men descending toward her, and she met them. "
"8688","1 Samuel","25","21","David had just said, “It’s been useless—all my watching over this fellow’s property in the wilderness so that nothing of his was missing. He has paid me back evil for good. "
"8689","1 Samuel","25","22","May God deal with David,25:22 Some Septuagint manuscripts; Hebrew with David’s enemies be it ever so severely, if by morning I leave alive one male of all who belong to him!”"
"8690","1 Samuel","25","23","When Abigail saw David, she quickly got off her donkey and bowed down before David with her face to the ground. "
"8691","1 Samuel","25","24","She fell at his feet and said: “Pardon your servant, my lord, and let me speak to you; hear what your servant has to say. "
"8692","1 Samuel","25","25","Please pay no attention, my lord, to that wicked man Nabal. He is just like his name—his name means Fool, and folly goes with him. And as for me, your servant, I did not see the men my lord sent. "
"8693","1 Samuel","25","26","And now, my lord, as surely as the Lord your God lives and as you live, since the Lord has kept you from bloodshed and from avenging yourself with your own hands, may your enemies and all who are intent on harming my lord be like Nabal. "
"8694","1 Samuel","25","27","And let this gift, which your servant has brought to my lord, be given to the men who follow you. "
"8695","1 Samuel","25","28","""Please forgive your servant’s presumption. The Lord your God will certainly make a lasting dynasty for my lord, because you fight the Lord’s battles, and no wrongdoing will be found in you as long as you live. "
"8696","1 Samuel","25","29","Even though someone is pursuing you to take your life, the life of my lord will be bound securely in the bundle of the living by the Lord your God, but the lives of your enemies he will hurl away as from the pocket of a sling. "
"8697","1 Samuel","25","30","When the Lord has fulfilled for my lord every good thing he promised concerning him and has appointed him ruler over Israel, "
"8698","1 Samuel","25","31","my lord will not have on his conscience the staggering burden of needless bloodshed or of having avenged himself. And when the Lord your God has brought my lord success, remember your servant.”"
"8699","1 Samuel","25","32","David said to Abigail, “Praise be to the Lord, the God of Israel, who has sent you today to meet me. "
"8700","1 Samuel","25","33","May you be blessed for your good judgment and for keeping me from bloodshed this day and from avenging myself with my own hands. "
"8701","1 Samuel","25","34","Otherwise, as surely as the Lord, the God of Israel, lives, who has kept me from harming you, if you had not come quickly to meet me, not one male belonging to Nabal would have been left alive by daybreak.”"
"8702","1 Samuel","25","35","Then David accepted from her hand what she had brought him and said, “Go home in peace. I have heard your words and granted your request.”"
"8703","1 Samuel","25","36","When Abigail went to Nabal, he was in the house holding a banquet like that of a king. He was in high spirits and very drunk. So she told him nothing at all until daybreak. "
"8704","1 Samuel","25","37","Then in the morning, when Nabal was sober, his wife told him all these things, and his heart failed him and he became like a stone. "
"8705","1 Samuel","25","38","About ten days later, the Lord struck Nabal and he died."
"8706","1 Samuel","25","39","When David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, “Praise be to the Lord, who has upheld my cause against Nabal for treating me with contempt. He has kept his servant from doing wrong and has brought Nabal’s wrongdoing down on his own head.”Then David sent word to Abigail, asking her to become his wife. "
"8707","1 Samuel","25","40","His servants went to Carmel and said to Abigail, “David has sent us to you to take you to become his wife.”"
"8708","1 Samuel","25","41","She bowed down with her face to the ground and said, “I am your servant and am ready to serve you and wash the feet of my lord’s servants.” "
"8709","1 Samuel","25","42","Abigail quickly got on a donkey and, attended by her five female servants, went with David’s messengers and became his wife. "
"8710","1 Samuel","25","43","David had also married Ahinoam of Jezreel, and they both were his wives. "
"8711","1 Samuel","25","44","But Saul had given his daughter Michal, David’s wife, to Paltiel25:44 Hebrew Palti, a variant of Paltiel son of Laish, who was from Gallim."
"8712","1 Samuel","26","1","The Ziphites went to Saul at Gibeah and said, “Is not David hiding on the hill of Hakilah, which faces Jeshimon?”"
"8713","1 Samuel","26","2","So Saul went down to the Desert of Ziph, with his three thousand select Israelite troops, to search there for David. "
"8714","1 Samuel","26","3","Saul made his camp beside the road on the hill of Hakilah facing Jeshimon, but David stayed in the wilderness. When he saw that Saul had followed him there, "
"8715","1 Samuel","26","4","he sent out scouts and learned that Saul had definitely arrived."
"8716","1 Samuel","26","5","Then David set out and went to the place where Saul had camped. He saw where Saul and Abner son of Ner, the commander of the army, had lain down. Saul was lying inside the camp, with the army encamped around him."
"8717","1 Samuel","26","6","David then asked Ahimelek the Hittite and Abishai son of Zeruiah, Joab’s brother, “Who will go down into the camp with me to Saul?”“I’ll go with you,” said Abishai."
"8718","1 Samuel","26","7","So David and Abishai went to the army by night, and there was Saul, lying asleep inside the camp with his spear stuck in the ground near his head. Abner and the soldiers were lying around him."
"8719","1 Samuel","26","8","Abishai said to David, “Today God has delivered your enemy into your hands. Now let me pin him to the ground with one thrust of the spear; I won’t strike him twice.”"
"8720","1 Samuel","26","9","But David said to Abishai, “Don’t destroy him! Who can lay a hand on the Lord’s anointed and be guiltless? "
"8721","1 Samuel","26","10","As surely as the Lord lives,” he said, “the Lord himself will strike him, or his time will come and he will die, or he will go into battle and perish. "
"8722","1 Samuel","26","11","But the Lord forbid that I should lay a hand on the Lord’s anointed. Now get the spear and water jug that are near his head, and let’s go.”"
"8723","1 Samuel","26","12","So David took the spear and water jug near Saul’s head, and they left. No one saw or knew about it, nor did anyone wake up. They were all sleeping, because the Lord had put them into a deep sleep."
"8724","1 Samuel","26","13","Then David crossed over to the other side and stood on top of the hill some distance away; there was a wide space between them. "
"8725","1 Samuel","26","14","He called out to the army and to Abner son of Ner, “Aren’t you going to answer me, Abner?”Abner replied, “Who are you who calls to the king?”"
"8726","1 Samuel","26","15","David said, “You’re a man, aren’t you? And who is like you in Israel? Why didn’t you guard your lord the king? Someone came to destroy your lord the king. "
"8727","1 Samuel","26","16","What you have done is not good. As surely as the Lord lives, you and your men must die, because you did not guard your master, the Lord’s anointed. Look around you. Where are the king’s spear and water jug that were near his head?”"
"8728","1 Samuel","26","17","Saul recognized David’s voice and said, “Is that your voice, David my son?”David replied, “Yes it is, my lord the king.” "
"8729","1 Samuel","26","18","And he added, “Why is my lord pursuing his servant? What have I done, and what wrong am I guilty of? "
"8730","1 Samuel","26","19","Now let my lord the king listen to his servant’s words. If the Lord has incited you against me, then may he accept an offering. If, however, people have done it, may they be cursed before the Lord! They have driven me today from my share in the Lord’s inheritance and have said, ‘Go, serve other gods.’ "
"8731","1 Samuel","26","20","Now do not let my blood fall to the ground far from the presence of the Lord. The king of Israel has come out to look for a flea—as one hunts a partridge in the mountains.”"
"8732","1 Samuel","26","21","Then Saul said, “I have sinned. Come back, David my son. Because you considered my life precious today, I will not try to harm you again. Surely I have acted like a fool and have been terribly wrong.” "
"8733","1 Samuel","26","22","""Here is the king’s spear,” David answered. “Let one of your young men come over and get it. "
"8734","1 Samuel","26","23","The Lord rewards everyone for their righteousness and faithfulness. The Lord delivered you into my hands today, but I would not lay a hand on the Lord’s anointed. "
"8735","1 Samuel","26","24","As surely as I valued your life today, so may the Lord value my life and deliver me from all trouble.”"
"8736","1 Samuel","26","25","Then Saul said to David, “May you be blessed, David my son; you will do great things and surely triumph.”So David went on his way, and Saul returned home."
"8737","1 Samuel","27","1","But David thought to himself, “One of these days I will be destroyed by the hand of Saul. The best thing I can do is to escape to the land of the Philistines. Then Saul will give up searching for me anywhere in Israel, and I will slip out of his hand.”"
"8738","1 Samuel","27","2","So David and the six hundred men with him left and went over to Achish son of Maok king of Gath. "
"8739","1 Samuel","27","3","David and his men settled in Gath with Achish. Each man had his family with him, and David had his two wives: Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail of Carmel, the widow of Nabal. "
"8740","1 Samuel","27","4","When Saul was told that David had fled to Gath, he no longer searched for him."
"8741","1 Samuel","27","5","Then David said to Achish, “If I have found favor in your eyes, let a place be assigned to me in one of the country towns, that I may live there. Why should your servant live in the royal city with you?”"
"8742","1 Samuel","27","6","So on that day Achish gave him Ziklag, and it has belonged to the kings of Judah ever since. "
"8743","1 Samuel","27","7","David lived in Philistine territory a year and four months."
"8744","1 Samuel","27","8","Now David and his men went up and raided the Geshurites, the Girzites and the Amalekites. (From ancient times these peoples had lived in the land extending to Shur and Egypt.) "
"8745","1 Samuel","27","9","Whenever David attacked an area, he did not leave a man or woman alive, but took sheep and cattle, donkeys and camels, and clothes. Then he returned to Achish."
"8746","1 Samuel","27","10","When Achish asked, “Where did you go raiding today?” David would say, “Against the Negev of Judah” or “Against the Negev of Jerahmeel” or “Against the Negev of the Kenites.” "
"8747","1 Samuel","27","11","He did not leave a man or woman alive to be brought to Gath, for he thought, “They might inform on us and say, ‘This is what David did.’ ” And such was his practice as long as he lived in Philistine territory. "
"8748","1 Samuel","27","12","Achish trusted David and said to himself, “He has become so obnoxious to his people, the Israelites, that he will be my servant for life.”"
"8749","1 Samuel","28","1","In those days the Philistines gathered their forces to fight against Israel. Achish said to David, “You must understand that you and your men will accompany me in the army.”"
"8750","1 Samuel","28","2","David said, “Then you will see for yourself what your servant can do.”Achish replied, “Very well, I will make you my bodyguard for life.”Saul and the Medium at Endor"
"8751","1 Samuel","28","3","Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had mourned for him and buried him in his own town of Ramah. Saul had expelled the mediums and spiritists from the land."
"8752","1 Samuel","28","4","The Philistines assembled and came and set up camp at Shunem, while Saul gathered all Israel and set up camp at Gilboa. "
"8753","1 Samuel","28","5","When Saul saw the Philistine army, he was afraid; terror filled his heart. "
"8754","1 Samuel","28","6","He inquired of the Lord, but the Lord did not answer him by dreams or Urim or prophets. "
"8755","1 Samuel","28","7","Saul then said to his attendants, “Find me a woman who is a medium, so I may go and inquire of her.”“There is one in Endor,” they said."
"8756","1 Samuel","28","8","So Saul disguised himself, putting on other clothes, and at night he and two men went to the woman. “Consult a spirit for me,” he said, “and bring up for me the one I name.”"
"8757","1 Samuel","28","9","But the woman said to him, “Surely you know what Saul has done. He has cut off the mediums and spiritists from the land. Why have you set a trap for my life to bring about my death?”"
"8758","1 Samuel","28","10","Saul swore to her by the Lord, “As surely as the Lord lives, you will not be punished for this.”"
"8759","1 Samuel","28","11","Then the woman asked, “Whom shall I bring up for you?”“Bring up Samuel,” he said."
"8760","1 Samuel","28","12","When the woman saw Samuel, she cried out at the top of her voice and said to Saul, “Why have you deceived me? You are Saul!”"
"8761","1 Samuel","28","13","The king said to her, “Don’t be afraid. What do you see?”The woman said, “I see a ghostly figure28:13 Or see spirits; or see gods coming up out of the earth.” "
"8762","1 Samuel","28","14","""What does he look like?” he asked.“An old man wearing a robe is coming up,” she said.Then Saul knew it was Samuel, and he bowed down and prostrated himself with his face to the ground."
"8763","1 Samuel","28","15","Samuel said to Saul, “Why have you disturbed me by bringing me up?”“I am in great distress,” Saul said. “The Philistines are fighting against me, and God has departed from me. He no longer answers me, either by prophets or by dreams. So I have called on you to tell me what to do.”"
"8764","1 Samuel","28","16","Samuel said, “Why do you consult me, now that the Lord has departed from you and become your enemy? "
"8765","1 Samuel","28","17","The Lord has done what he predicted through me. The Lord has torn the kingdom out of your hands and given it to one of your neighbors—to David. "
"8766","1 Samuel","28","18","Because you did not obey the Lord or carry out his fierce wrath against the Amalekites, the Lord has done this to you today. "
"8767","1 Samuel","28","19","The Lord will deliver both Israel and you into the hands of the Philistines, and tomorrow you and your sons will be with me. The Lord will also give the army of Israel into the hands of the Philistines.”"
"8768","1 Samuel","28","20","Immediately Saul fell full length on the ground, filled with fear because of Samuel’s words. His strength was gone, for he had eaten nothing all that day and all that night."
"8769","1 Samuel","28","21","When the woman came to Saul and saw that he was greatly shaken, she said, “Look, your servant has obeyed you. I took my life in my hands and did what you told me to do. "
"8770","1 Samuel","28","22","Now please listen to your servant and let me give you some food so you may eat and have the strength to go on your way.”"
"8771","1 Samuel","28","23","He refused and said, “I will not eat.”But his men joined the woman in urging him, and he listened to them. He got up from the ground and sat on the couch."
"8772","1 Samuel","28","24","The woman had a fattened calf at the house, which she butchered at once. She took some flour, kneaded it and baked bread without yeast. "
"8773","1 Samuel","28","25","Then she set it before Saul and his men, and they ate. That same night they got up and left."
"8774","1 Samuel","29","1","The Philistines gathered all their forces at Aphek, and Israel camped by the spring in Jezreel. "
"8775","1 Samuel","29","2","As the Philistine rulers marched with their units of hundreds and thousands, David and his men were marching at the rear with Achish. "
"8776","1 Samuel","29","3","The commanders of the Philistines asked, “What about these Hebrews?”Achish replied, “Is this not David, who was an officer of Saul king of Israel? He has already been with me for over a year, and from the day he left Saul until now, I have found no fault in him.”"
"8777","1 Samuel","29","4","But the Philistine commanders were angry with Achish and said, “Send the man back, that he may return to the place you assigned him. He must not go with us into battle, or he will turn against us during the fighting. How better could he regain his master’s favor than by taking the heads of our own men? "
"8778","1 Samuel","29","5","Isn’t this the David they sang about in their dances:“ ‘Saul has slain his thousands,and David his tens of thousands’?”"
"8779","1 Samuel","29","6","So Achish called David and said to him, “As surely as the Lord lives, you have been reliable, and I would be pleased to have you serve with me in the army. From the day you came to me until today, I have found no fault in you, but the rulers don’t approve of you. "
"8780","1 Samuel","29","7","Now turn back and go in peace; do nothing to displease the Philistine rulers.” "
"8781","1 Samuel","29","8","""But what have I done?” asked David. “What have you found against your servant from the day I came to you until now? Why can’t I go and fight against the enemies of my lord the king?”"
"8782","1 Samuel","29","9","Achish answered, “I know that you have been as pleasing in my eyes as an angel of God; nevertheless, the Philistine commanders have said, ‘He must not go up with us into battle.’ "
"8783","1 Samuel","29","10","Now get up early, along with your master’s servants who have come with you, and leave in the morning as soon as it is light.”"
"8784","1 Samuel","29","11","So David and his men got up early in the morning to go back to the land of the Philistines, and the Philistines went up to Jezreel."
"8785","1 Samuel","30","1","David and his men reached Ziklag on the third day. Now the Amalekites had raided the Negev and Ziklag. They had attacked Ziklag and burned it, "
"8786","1 Samuel","30","2","and had taken captive the women and everyone else in it, both young and old. They killed none of them, but carried them off as they went on their way."
"8787","1 Samuel","30","3","When David and his men reached Ziklag, they found it destroyed by fire and their wives and sons and daughters taken captive. "
"8788","1 Samuel","30","4","So David and his men wept aloud until they had no strength left to weep. "
"8789","1 Samuel","30","5","David’s two wives had been captured—Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail, the widow of Nabal of Carmel. "
"8790","1 Samuel","30","6","David was greatly distressed because the men were talking of stoning him; each one was bitter in spirit because of his sons and daughters. But David found strength in the Lord his God."
"8791","1 Samuel","30","7","Then David said to Abiathar the priest, the son of Ahimelek, “Bring me the ephod.” Abiathar brought it to him, "
"8792","1 Samuel","30","8","and David inquired of the Lord, “Shall I pursue this raiding party? Will I overtake them?”“Pursue them,” he answered. “You will certainly overtake them and succeed in the rescue.”"
"8793","1 Samuel","30","9","David and the six hundred men with him came to the Besor Valley, where some stayed behind. "
"8794","1 Samuel","30","10","Two hundred of them were too exhausted to cross the valley, but David and the other four hundred continued the pursuit."
"8795","1 Samuel","30","11","They found an Egyptian in a field and brought him to David. They gave him water to drink and food to eat— "
"8796","1 Samuel","30","12","part of a cake of pressed figs and two cakes of raisins. He ate and was revived, for he had not eaten any food or drunk any water for three days and three nights."
"8797","1 Samuel","30","13","David asked him, “Who do you belong to? Where do you come from?”He said, “I am an Egyptian, the slave of an Amalekite. My master abandoned me when I became ill three days ago. "
"8798","1 Samuel","30","14","We raided the Negev of the Kerethites, some territory belonging to Judah and the Negev of Caleb. And we burned Ziklag.”"
"8799","1 Samuel","30","15","David asked him, “Can you lead me down to this raiding party?”He answered, “Swear to me before God that you will not kill me or hand me over to my master, and I will take you down to them.”"
"8800","1 Samuel","30","16","He led David down, and there they were, scattered over the countryside, eating, drinking and reveling because of the great amount of plunder they had taken from the land of the Philistines and from Judah. "
"8801","1 Samuel","30","17","David fought them from dusk until the evening of the next day, and none of them got away, except four hundred young men who rode off on camels and fled. "
"8802","1 Samuel","30","18","David recovered everything the Amalekites had taken, including his two wives. "
"8803","1 Samuel","30","19","Nothing was missing: young or old, boy or girl, plunder or anything else they had taken. David brought everything back. "
"8804","1 Samuel","30","20","He took all the flocks and herds, and his men drove them ahead of the other livestock, saying, “This is David’s plunder.”"
"8805","1 Samuel","30","21","Then David came to the two hundred men who had been too exhausted to follow him and who were left behind at the Besor Valley. They came out to meet David and the men with him. As David and his men approached, he asked them how they were. "
"8806","1 Samuel","30","22","But all the evil men and troublemakers among David’s followers said, “Because they did not go out with us, we will not share with them the plunder we recovered. However, each man may take his wife and children and go.”"
"8807","1 Samuel","30","23","David replied, “No, my brothers, you must not do that with what the Lord has given us. He has protected us and delivered into our hands the raiding party that came against us. "
"8808","1 Samuel","30","24","Who will listen to what you say? The share of the man who stayed with the supplies is to be the same as that of him who went down to the battle. All will share alike.” "
"8809","1 Samuel","30","25","David made this a statute and ordinance for Israel from that day to this."
"8810","1 Samuel","30","26","When David reached Ziklag, he sent some of the plunder to the elders of Judah, who were his friends, saying, “Here is a gift for you from the plunder of the Lord’s enemies.”"
"8811","1 Samuel","30","27","David sent it to those who were in Bethel, Ramoth Negev and Jattir; "
"8812","1 Samuel","30","28","to those in Aroer, Siphmoth, Eshtemoa "
"8813","1 Samuel","30","29","and Rakal; to those in the towns of the Jerahmeelites and the Kenites; "
"8814","1 Samuel","30","30","to those in Hormah, Bor Ashan, Athak "
"8815","1 Samuel","30","31","and Hebron; and to those in all the other places where he and his men had roamed."
"8816","1 Samuel","31","1","Now the Philistines fought against Israel; the Israelites fled before them, and many fell dead on Mount Gilboa. "
"8817","1 Samuel","31","2","The Philistines were in hot pursuit of Saul and his sons, and they killed his sons Jonathan, Abinadab and Malki-Shua. "
"8818","1 Samuel","31","3","The fighting grew fierce around Saul, and when the archers overtook him, they wounded him critically."
"8819","1 Samuel","31","4","Saul said to his armor-bearer, “Draw your sword and run me through, or these uncircumcised fellows will come and run me through and abuse me.”But his armor-bearer was terrified and would not do it; so Saul took his own sword and fell on it. "
"8820","1 Samuel","31","5","When the armor-bearer saw that Saul was dead, he too fell on his sword and died with him. "
"8821","1 Samuel","31","6","So Saul and his three sons and his armor-bearer and all his men died together that same day."
"8822","1 Samuel","31","7","When the Israelites along the valley and those across the Jordan saw that the Israelite army had fled and that Saul and his sons had died, they abandoned their towns and fled. And the Philistines came and occupied them."
"8823","1 Samuel","31","8","The next day, when the Philistines came to strip the dead, they found Saul and his three sons fallen on Mount Gilboa. "
"8824","1 Samuel","31","9","They cut off his head and stripped off his armor, and they sent messengers throughout the land of the Philistines to proclaim the news in the temple of their idols and among their people. "
"8825","1 Samuel","31","10","They put his armor in the temple of the Ashtoreths and fastened his body to the wall of Beth Shan."
"8826","1 Samuel","31","11","When the people of Jabesh Gilead heard what the Philistines had done to Saul, "
"8827","1 Samuel","31","12","all their valiant men marched through the night to Beth Shan. They took down the bodies of Saul and his sons from the wall of Beth Shan and went to Jabesh, where they burned them. "
"8828","1 Samuel","31","13","Then they took their bones and buried them under a tamarisk tree at Jabesh, and they fasted seven days."
"8829","1 Samuel","1","1","There was a certain man from Ramathaim, a Zuphite1:1 See Septuagint and 1 Chron. 6:26-27,33-35; or from Ramathaim Zuphim. from the hill country of Ephraim, whose name was Elkanah son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite. "
"8830","1 Samuel","1","2","He had two wives; one was called Hannah and the other Peninnah. Peninnah had children, but Hannah had none."
"8831","1 Samuel","1","3","Year after year this man went up from his town to worship and sacrifice to the Lord Almighty at Shiloh, where Hophni and Phinehas, the two sons of Eli, were priests of the Lord. "
"8832","1 Samuel","1","4","Whenever the day came for Elkanah to sacrifice, he would give portions of the meat to his wife Peninnah and to all her sons and daughters. "
"8833","1 Samuel","1","5","But to Hannah he gave a double portion because he loved her, and the Lord had closed her womb. "
"8834","1 Samuel","1","6","Because the Lord had closed Hannah’s womb, her rival kept provoking her in order to irritate her. "
"8835","1 Samuel","1","7","This went on year after year. Whenever Hannah went up to the house of the Lord, her rival provoked her till she wept and would not eat. "
"8836","1 Samuel","1","8","Her husband Elkanah would say to her, “Hannah, why are you weeping? Why don’t you eat? Why are you downhearted? Don’t I mean more to you than ten sons?”"
"8837","1 Samuel","1","9","Once when they had finished eating and drinking in Shiloh, Hannah stood up. Now Eli the priest was sitting on his chair by the doorpost of the Lord’s house. "
"8838","1 Samuel","1","10","In her deep anguish Hannah prayed to the Lord, weeping bitterly. "
"8839","1 Samuel","1","11","And she made a vow, saying, “Lord Almighty, if you will only look on your servant’s misery and remember me, and not forget your servant but give her a son, then I will give him to the Lord for all the days of his life, and no razor will ever be used on his head.”"
"8840","1 Samuel","1","12","As she kept on praying to the Lord, Eli observed her mouth. "
"8841","1 Samuel","1","13","Hannah was praying in her heart, and her lips were moving but her voice was not heard. Eli thought she was drunk "
"8842","1 Samuel","1","14","and said to her, “How long are you going to stay drunk? Put away your wine.” "
"8843","1 Samuel","1","15","""Not so, my lord,” Hannah replied, “I am a woman who is deeply troubled. I have not been drinking wine or beer; I was pouring out my soul to the Lord. "
"8844","1 Samuel","1","16","Do not take your servant for a wicked woman; I have been praying here out of my great anguish and grief.”"
"8845","1 Samuel","1","17","Eli answered, “Go in peace, and may the God of Israel grant you what you have asked of him.”"
"8846","1 Samuel","1","18","She said, “May your servant find favor in your eyes.” Then she went her way and ate something, and her face was no longer downcast."
"8847","1 Samuel","1","19","Early the next morning they arose and worshiped before the Lord and then went back to their home at Ramah. Elkanah made love to his wife Hannah, and the Lord remembered her. "
"8848","1 Samuel","1","20","So in the course of time Hannah became pregnant and gave birth to a son. She named him Samuel,1:20 Samuel sounds like the Hebrew for heard by God. saying, “Because I asked the Lord for him.”Hannah Dedicates Samuel"
"8849","1 Samuel","1","21","When her husband Elkanah went up with all his family to offer the annual sacrifice to the Lord and to fulfill his vow, "
"8850","1 Samuel","1","22","Hannah did not go. She said to her husband, “After the boy is weaned, I will take him and present him before the Lord, and he will live there always.”1:22 Masoretic Text; Dead Sea Scrolls always. I have dedicated him as a Nazirite—all the days of his life.” "
"8851","1 Samuel","1","23","""Do what seems best to you,” her husband Elkanah told her. “Stay here until you have weaned him; only may the Lord make good his1:23 Masoretic Text; Dead Sea Scrolls, Septuagint and Syriac your word.” So the woman stayed at home and nursed her son until she had weaned him."
"8852","1 Samuel","1","24","After he was weaned, she took the boy with her, young as he was, along with a three-year-old bull,1:24 Dead Sea Scrolls, Septuagint and Syriac; Masoretic Text with three bulls an ephah1:24 That is, probably about 36 pounds or about 16 kilograms of flour and a skin of wine, and brought him to the house of the Lord at Shiloh. "
"8853","1 Samuel","1","25","When the bull had been sacrificed, they brought the boy to Eli, "
"8854","1 Samuel","1","26","and she said to him, “Pardon me, my lord. As surely as you live, I am the woman who stood here beside you praying to the Lord. "
"8855","1 Samuel","1","27","I prayed for this child, and the Lord has granted me what I asked of him. "
"8856","1 Samuel","1","28","So now I give him to the Lord. For his whole life he will be given over to the Lord.” And he worshiped the Lord there."
"8857","1 Samuel","2","1","Then Hannah prayed and said:“My heart rejoices in the Lord;in the Lord my horn2:1 Horn here symbolizes strength; also in verse 10. is lifted high.My mouth boasts over my enemies,for I delight in your deliverance. "
"8858","1 Samuel","2","2","""There is no one holy like the Lord;there is no one besides you;there is no Rock like our God. "
"8859","1 Samuel","2","3","""Do not keep talking so proudlyor let your mouth speak such arrogance,for the Lord is a God who knows,and by him deeds are weighed. "
"8860","1 Samuel","2","4","""The bows of the warriors are broken,but those who stumbled are armed with strength."
"8861","1 Samuel","2","5","Those who were full hire themselves out for food,but those who were hungry are hungry no more.She who was barren has borne seven children,but she who has had many sons pines away. "
"8862","1 Samuel","2","6","""The Lord brings death and makes alive;he brings down to the grave and raises up."
"8863","1 Samuel","2","7","The Lord sends poverty and wealth;he humbles and he exalts."
"8864","1 Samuel","2","8","He raises the poor from the dustand lifts the needy from the ash heap;he seats them with princesand has them inherit a throne of honor.“For the foundations of the earth are the Lord’s;on them he has set the world."
"8865","1 Samuel","2","9","He will guard the feet of his faithful servants,but the wicked will be silenced in the place of darkness.“It is not by strength that one prevails;"
"8866","1 Samuel","2","10","those who oppose the Lord will be broken.The Most High will thunder from heaven;the Lord will judge the ends of the earth.“He will give strength to his kingand exalt the horn of his anointed.”"
"8867","1 Samuel","2","11","Then Elkanah went home to Ramah, but the boy ministered before the Lord under Eli the priest.Eli’s Wicked Sons"
"8868","1 Samuel","2","12","Eli’s sons were scoundrels; they had no regard for the Lord. "
"8869","1 Samuel","2","13","Now it was the practice of the priests that, whenever any of the people offered a sacrifice, the priest’s servant would come with a three-pronged fork in his hand while the meat was being boiled "
"8870","1 Samuel","2","14","and would plunge the fork into the pan or kettle or caldron or pot. Whatever the fork brought up the priest would take for himself. This is how they treated all the Israelites who came to Shiloh. "
"8871","1 Samuel","2","15","But even before the fat was burned, the priest’s servant would come and say to the person who was sacrificing, “Give the priest some meat to roast; he won’t accept boiled meat from you, but only raw.”"
"8872","1 Samuel","2","16","If the person said to him, “Let the fat be burned first, and then take whatever you want,” the servant would answer, “No, hand it over now; if you don’t, I’ll take it by force.”"
"8873","1 Samuel","2","17","This sin of the young men was very great in the Lord’s sight, for they2:17 Dead Sea Scrolls and Septuagint; Masoretic Text people were treating the Lord’s offering with contempt."
"8874","1 Samuel","2","18","But Samuel was ministering before the Lord—a boy wearing a linen ephod. "
"8875","1 Samuel","2","19","Each year his mother made him a little robe and took it to him when she went up with her husband to offer the annual sacrifice. "
"8876","1 Samuel","2","20","Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife, saying, “May the Lord give you children by this woman to take the place of the one she prayed for and gave to2:20 Dead Sea Scrolls; Masoretic Text and asked from the Lord.” Then they would go home. "
"8877","1 Samuel","2","21","And the Lord was gracious to Hannah; she gave birth to three sons and two daughters. Meanwhile, the boy Samuel grew up in the presence of the Lord."
"8878","1 Samuel","2","22","Now Eli, who was very old, heard about everything his sons were doing to all Israel and how they slept with the women who served at the entrance to the tent of meeting. "
"8879","1 Samuel","2","23","So he said to them, “Why do you do such things? I hear from all the people about these wicked deeds of yours. "
"8880","1 Samuel","2","24","No, my sons; the report I hear spreading among the Lord’s people is not good. "
"8881","1 Samuel","2","25","If one person sins against another, God2:25 Or the judges may mediate for the offender; but if anyone sins against the Lord, who will intercede for them?” His sons, however, did not listen to their father’s rebuke, for it was the Lord’s will to put them to death."
"8882","1 Samuel","2","26","And the boy Samuel continued to grow in stature and in favor with the Lord and with people.Prophecy Against the House of Eli"
"8883","1 Samuel","2","27","Now a man of God came to Eli and said to him, “This is what the Lord says: ‘Did I not clearly reveal myself to your ancestor’s family when they were in Egypt under Pharaoh? "
"8884","1 Samuel","2","28","I chose your ancestor out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to go up to my altar, to burn incense, and to wear an ephod in my presence. I also gave your ancestor’s family all the food offerings presented by the Israelites. "
"8885","1 Samuel","2","29","Why do you2:29 The Hebrew is plural. scorn my sacrifice and offering that I prescribed for my dwelling? Why do you honor your sons more than me by fattening yourselves on the choice parts of every offering made by my people Israel?’ "
"8886","1 Samuel","2","30","""Therefore the Lord, the God of Israel, declares: ‘I promised that members of your family would minister before me forever.’ But now the Lord declares: ‘Far be it from me! Those who honor me I will honor, but those who despise me will be disdained. "
"8887","1 Samuel","2","31","The time is coming when I will cut short your strength and the strength of your priestly house, so that no one in it will reach old age, "
"8888","1 Samuel","2","32","and you will see distress in my dwelling. Although good will be done to Israel, no one in your family line will ever reach old age. "
"8889","1 Samuel","2","33","Every one of you that I do not cut off from serving at my altar I will spare only to destroy your sight and sap your strength, and all your descendants will die in the prime of life. "
"8890","1 Samuel","2","34",""" ‘And what happens to your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, will be a sign to you—they will both die on the same day. "

"8892","1 Samuel","2","36","Then everyone left in your family line will come and bow down before him for a piece of silver and a loaf of bread and plead, “Appoint me to some priestly office so I can have food to eat.” ’ ”"
"8893","1 Samuel","3","1","The boy Samuel ministered before the Lord under Eli. In those days the word of the Lord was rare; there were not many visions."
"8894","1 Samuel","3","2","One night Eli, whose eyes were becoming so weak that he could barely see, was lying down in his usual place. "
"8895","1 Samuel","3","3","The lamp of God had not yet gone out, and Samuel was lying down in the house of the Lord, where the ark of God was. "
"8896","1 Samuel","3","4","Then the Lord called Samuel.Samuel answered, “Here I am.” "
"8897","1 Samuel","3","5","And he ran to Eli and said, “Here I am; you called me.”But Eli said, “I did not call; go back and lie down.” So he went and lay down."
"8898","1 Samuel","3","6","Again the Lord called, “Samuel!” And Samuel got up and went to Eli and said, “Here I am; you called me.”“My son,” Eli said, “I did not call; go back and lie down.”"
"8899","1 Samuel","3","7","Now Samuel did not yet know the Lord: The word of the Lord had not yet been revealed to him."
"8900","1 Samuel","3","8","A third time the Lord called, “Samuel!” And Samuel got up and went to Eli and said, “Here I am; you called me.”Then Eli realized that the Lord was calling the boy. "
"8901","1 Samuel","3","9","So Eli told Samuel, “Go and lie down, and if he calls you, say, ‘Speak, Lord, for your servant is listening.’ ” So Samuel went and lay down in his place."
"8902","1 Samuel","3","10","The Lord came and stood there, calling as at the other times, “Samuel! Samuel!”Then Samuel said, “Speak, for your servant is listening.”"
"8903","1 Samuel","3","11","And the Lord said to Samuel: “See, I am about to do something in Israel that will make the ears of everyone who hears about it tingle. "
"8904","1 Samuel","3","12","At that time I will carry out against Eli everything I spoke against his family—from beginning to end. "
"8905","1 Samuel","3","13","For I told him that I would judge his family forever because of the sin he knew about; his sons blasphemed God,3:13 An ancient Hebrew scribal tradition (see also Septuagint); Masoretic Text sons made themselves contemptible and he failed to restrain them. "
"8906","1 Samuel","3","14","Therefore I swore to the house of Eli, ‘The guilt of Eli’s house will never be atoned for by sacrifice or offering.’ ”"
"8907","1 Samuel","3","15","Samuel lay down until morning and then opened the doors of the house of the Lord. He was afraid to tell Eli the vision, "
"8908","1 Samuel","3","16","but Eli called him and said, “Samuel, my son.”Samuel answered, “Here I am.” "
"8909","1 Samuel","3","17","""What was it he said to you?” Eli asked. “Do not hide it from me. May God deal with you, be it ever so severely, if you hide from me anything he told you.” "
"8910","1 Samuel","3","18","So Samuel told him everything, hiding nothing from him. Then Eli said, “He is the Lord; let him do what is good in his eyes.”"
"8911","1 Samuel","3","19","The Lord was with Samuel as he grew up, and he let none of Samuel’s words fall to the ground. "
"8912","1 Samuel","3","20","And all Israel from Dan to Beersheba recognized that Samuel was attested as a prophet of the Lord. "
"8913","1 Samuel","3","21","The Lord continued to appear at Shiloh, and there he revealed himself to Samuel through his word."
"8914","1 Samuel","4","1","And Samuel’s word came to all Israel.The Philistines Capture the ArkNow the Israelites went out to fight against the Philistines. The Israelites camped at Ebenezer, and the Philistines at Aphek. "
"8915","1 Samuel","4","2","The Philistines deployed their forces to meet Israel, and as the battle spread, Israel was defeated by the Philistines, who killed about four thousand of them on the battlefield. "
"8916","1 Samuel","4","3","When the soldiers returned to camp, the elders of Israel asked, “Why did the Lord bring defeat on us today before the Philistines? Let us bring the ark of the Lord’s covenant from Shiloh, so that he may go with us and save us from the hand of our enemies.”"
"8917","1 Samuel","4","4","So the people sent men to Shiloh, and they brought back the ark of the covenant of the Lord Almighty, who is enthroned between the cherubim. And Eli’s two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God."
"8918","1 Samuel","4","5","When the ark of the Lord’s covenant came into the camp, all Israel raised such a great shout that the ground shook. "
"8919","1 Samuel","4","6","Hearing the uproar, the Philistines asked, “What’s all this shouting in the Hebrew camp?”When they learned that the ark of the Lord had come into the camp, "
"8920","1 Samuel","4","7","the Philistines were afraid. “A god has4:7 Or “Gods have (see Septuagint) come into the camp,” they said. “Oh no! Nothing like this has happened before. "
"8921","1 Samuel","4","8","We’re doomed! Who will deliver us from the hand of these mighty gods? They are the gods who struck the Egyptians with all kinds of plagues in the wilderness. "
"8922","1 Samuel","4","9","Be strong, Philistines! Be men, or you will be subject to the Hebrews, as they have been to you. Be men, and fight!”"
"8923","1 Samuel","4","10","So the Philistines fought, and the Israelites were defeated and every man fled to his tent. The slaughter was very great; Israel lost thirty thousand foot soldiers. "
"8924","1 Samuel","4","11","The ark of God was captured, and Eli’s two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, died.Death of Eli"
"8925","1 Samuel","4","12","That same day a Benjamite ran from the battle line and went to Shiloh with his clothes torn and dust on his head. "
"8926","1 Samuel","4","13","When he arrived, there was Eli sitting on his chair by the side of the road, watching, because his heart feared for the ark of God. When the man entered the town and told what had happened, the whole town sent up a cry."
"8927","1 Samuel","4","14","Eli heard the outcry and asked, “What is the meaning of this uproar?”The man hurried over to Eli, "
"8928","1 Samuel","4","15","who was ninety-eight years old and whose eyes had failed so that he could not see. "
"8929","1 Samuel","4","16","He told Eli, “I have just come from the battle line; I fled from it this very day.”Eli asked, “What happened, my son?”"
"8930","1 Samuel","4","17","The man who brought the news replied, “Israel fled before the Philistines, and the army has suffered heavy losses. Also your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God has been captured.”"
"8931","1 Samuel","4","18","When he mentioned the ark of God, Eli fell backward off his chair by the side of the gate. His neck was broken and he died, for he was an old man, and he was heavy. He had led4:18 Traditionally judged Israel forty years."
"8932","1 Samuel","4","19","His daughter-in-law, the wife of Phinehas, was pregnant and near the time of delivery. When she heard the news that the ark of God had been captured and that her father-in-law and her husband were dead, she went into labor and gave birth, but was overcome by her labor pains. "
"8933","1 Samuel","4","20","As she was dying, the women attending her said, “Don’t despair; you have given birth to a son.” But she did not respond or pay any attention."
"8934","1 Samuel","4","21","She named the boy Ichabod,4:21 Ichabod means no glory. saying, “The Glory has departed from Israel”—because of the capture of the ark of God and the deaths of her father-in-law and her husband. "
"8935","1 Samuel","4","22","She said, “The Glory has departed from Israel, for the ark of God has been captured.”"
"8936","1 Samuel","5","1","After the Philistines had captured the ark of God, they took it from Ebenezer to Ashdod. "
"8937","1 Samuel","5","2","Then they carried the ark into Dagon’s temple and set it beside Dagon. "
"8938","1 Samuel","5","3","When the people of Ashdod rose early the next day, there was Dagon, fallen on his face on the ground before the ark of the Lord! They took Dagon and put him back in his place. "
"8939","1 Samuel","5","4","But the following morning when they rose, there was Dagon, fallen on his face on the ground before the ark of the Lord! His head and hands had been broken off and were lying on the threshold; only his body remained. "
"8940","1 Samuel","5","5","That is why to this day neither the priests of Dagon nor any others who enter Dagon’s temple at Ashdod step on the threshold."
"8941","1 Samuel","5","6","The Lord’s hand was heavy on the people of Ashdod and its vicinity; he brought devastation on them and afflicted them with tumors.5:6 Hebrew; Septuagint and Vulgate tumors. And rats appeared in their land, and there was death and destruction throughout the city "
"8942","1 Samuel","5","7","When the people of Ashdod saw what was happening, they said, “The ark of the god of Israel must not stay here with us, because his hand is heavy on us and on Dagon our god.” "
"8943","1 Samuel","5","8","So they called together all the rulers of the Philistines and asked them, “What shall we do with the ark of the god of Israel?”They answered, “Have the ark of the god of Israel moved to Gath.” So they moved the ark of the God of Israel."
"8944","1 Samuel","5","9","But after they had moved it, the Lord’s hand was against that city, throwing it into a great panic. He afflicted the people of the city, both young and old, with an outbreak of tumors.5:9 Or with tumors in the groin (see Septuagint) "
"8945","1 Samuel","5","10","So they sent the ark of God to Ekron.As the ark of God was entering Ekron, the people of Ekron cried out, “They have brought the ark of the god of Israel around to us to kill us and our people.” "
"8946","1 Samuel","5","11","So they called together all the rulers of the Philistines and said, “Send the ark of the god of Israel away; let it go back to its own place, or it5:11 Or he will kill us and our people.” For death had filled the city with panic; God’s hand was very heavy on it. "
"8947","1 Samuel","5","12","Those who did not die were afflicted with tumors, and the outcry of the city went up to heaven."
"8948","1 Samuel","6","1","When the ark of the Lord had been in Philistine territory seven months, "
"8949","1 Samuel","6","2","the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners and said, “What shall we do with the ark of the Lord? Tell us how we should send it back to its place.”"
"8950","1 Samuel","6","3","They answered, “If you return the ark of the god of Israel, do not send it back to him without a gift; by all means send a guilt offering to him. Then you will be healed, and you will know why his hand has not been lifted from you.”"
"8951","1 Samuel","6","4","The Philistines asked, “What guilt offering should we send to him?”They replied, “Five gold tumors and five gold rats, according to the number of the Philistine rulers, because the same plague has struck both you and your rulers. "
"8952","1 Samuel","6","5","Make models of the tumors and of the rats that are destroying the country, and give glory to Israel’s god. Perhaps he will lift his hand from you and your gods and your land. "
"8953","1 Samuel","6","6","Why do you harden your hearts as the Egyptians and Pharaoh did? When Israel’s god dealt harshly with them, did they not send the Israelites out so they could go on their way? "
"8954","1 Samuel","6","7","""Now then, get a new cart ready, with two cows that have calved and have never been yoked. Hitch the cows to the cart, but take their calves away and pen them up. "
"8955","1 Samuel","6","8","Take the ark of the Lord and put it on the cart, and in a chest beside it put the gold objects you are sending back to him as a guilt offering. Send it on its way, "
"8956","1 Samuel","6","9","but keep watching it. If it goes up to its own territory, toward Beth Shemesh, then the Lord has brought this great disaster on us. But if it does not, then we will know that it was not his hand that struck us but that it happened to us by chance.”"
"8957","1 Samuel","6","10","So they did this. They took two such cows and hitched them to the cart and penned up their calves. "
"8958","1 Samuel","6","11","They placed the ark of the Lord on the cart and along with it the chest containing the gold rats and the models of the tumors. "
"8959","1 Samuel","6","12","Then the cows went straight up toward Beth Shemesh, keeping on the road and lowing all the way; they did not turn to the right or to the left. The rulers of the Philistines followed them as far as the border of Beth Shemesh."
"8960","1 Samuel","6","13","Now the people of Beth Shemesh were harvesting their wheat in the valley, and when they looked up and saw the ark, they rejoiced at the sight. "
"8961","1 Samuel","6","14","The cart came to the field of Joshua of Beth Shemesh, and there it stopped beside a large rock. The people chopped up the wood of the cart and sacrificed the cows as a burnt offering to the Lord. "
"8962","1 Samuel","6","15","The Levites took down the ark of the Lord, together with the chest containing the gold objects, and placed them on the large rock. On that day the people of Beth Shemesh offered burnt offerings and made sacrifices to the Lord. "
"8963","1 Samuel","6","16","The five rulers of the Philistines saw all this and then returned that same day to Ekron."
"8964","1 Samuel","6","17","These are the gold tumors the Philistines sent as a guilt offering to the Lord—one each for Ashdod, Gaza, Ashkelon, Gath and Ekron. "
"8965","1 Samuel","6","18","And the number of the gold rats was according to the number of Philistine towns belonging to the five rulers—the fortified towns with their country villages. The large rock on which the Levites set the ark of the Lord is a witness to this day in the field of Joshua of Beth Shemesh."
"8966","1 Samuel","6","19","But God struck down some of the inhabitants of Beth Shemesh, putting seventy6:19 A few Hebrew manuscripts; most Hebrew manuscripts and Septuagint 50,070 of them to death because they looked into the ark of the Lord. The people mourned because of the heavy blow the Lord had dealt them. "
"8967","1 Samuel","6","20","And the people of Beth Shemesh asked, “Who can stand in the presence of the Lord, this holy God? To whom will the ark go up from here?”"
"8968","1 Samuel","6","21","Then they sent messengers to the people of Kiriath Jearim, saying, “The Philistines have returned the ark of the Lord. Come down and take it up to your town.”"
"8969","1 Samuel","7","1","So the men of Kiriath Jearim came and took up the ark of the Lord. They brought it to Abinadab’s house on the hill and consecrated Eleazar his son to guard the ark of the Lord. "
"8970","1 Samuel","7","2","The ark remained at Kiriath Jearim a long time—twenty years in all.Samuel Subdues the Philistines at MizpahThen all the people of Israel turned back to the Lord. "
"8971","1 Samuel","7","3","So Samuel said to all the Israelites, “If you are returning to the Lord with all your hearts, then rid yourselves of the foreign gods and the Ashtoreths and commit yourselves to the Lord and serve him only, and he will deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines.” "
"8972","1 Samuel","7","4","So the Israelites put away their Baals and Ashtoreths, and served the Lord only."
"8973","1 Samuel","7","5","Then Samuel said, “Assemble all Israel at Mizpah, and I will intercede with the Lord for you.” "
"8974","1 Samuel","7","6","When they had assembled at Mizpah, they drew water and poured it out before the Lord. On that day they fasted and there they confessed, “We have sinned against the Lord.” Now Samuel was serving as leader7:6 Traditionally judge; also in verse 15 of Israel at Mizpah."
"8975","1 Samuel","7","7","When the Philistines heard that Israel had assembled at Mizpah, the rulers of the Philistines came up to attack them. When the Israelites heard of it, they were afraid because of the Philistines. "
"8976","1 Samuel","7","8","They said to Samuel, “Do not stop crying out to the Lord our God for us, that he may rescue us from the hand of the Philistines.” "
"8977","1 Samuel","7","9","Then Samuel took a suckling lamb and sacrificed it as a whole burnt offering to the Lord. He cried out to the Lord on Israel’s behalf, and the Lord answered him."
"8978","1 Samuel","7","10","While Samuel was sacrificing the burnt offering, the Philistines drew near to engage Israel in battle. But that day the Lord thundered with loud thunder against the Philistines and threw them into such a panic that they were routed before the Israelites. "
"8979","1 Samuel","7","11","The men of Israel rushed out of Mizpah and pursued the Philistines, slaughtering them along the way to a point below Beth Kar."
"8980","1 Samuel","7","12","Then Samuel took a stone and set it up between Mizpah and Shen. He named it Ebenezer,7:12 Ebenezer means stone of help. saying, “Thus far the Lord has helped us.”"
"8981","1 Samuel","7","13","So the Philistines were subdued and they stopped invading Israel’s territory. Throughout Samuel’s lifetime, the hand of the Lord was against the Philistines. "
"8982","1 Samuel","7","14","The towns from Ekron to Gath that the Philistines had captured from Israel were restored to Israel, and Israel delivered the neighboring territory from the hands of the Philistines. And there was peace between Israel and the Amorites."
"8983","1 Samuel","7","15","Samuel continued as Israel’s leader all the days of his life. "
"8984","1 Samuel","7","16","From year to year he went on a circuit from Bethel to Gilgal to Mizpah, judging Israel in all those places. "
"8985","1 Samuel","7","17","But he always went back to Ramah, where his home was, and there he also held court for Israel. And he built an altar there to the Lord."
"8986","1 Samuel","8","1","When Samuel grew old, he appointed his sons as Israel’s leaders.8:1 Traditionally judges "
"8987","1 Samuel","8","2","The name of his firstborn was Joel and the name of his second was Abijah, and they served at Beersheba. "
"8988","1 Samuel","8","3","But his sons did not follow his ways. They turned aside after dishonest gain and accepted bribes and perverted justice."
"8989","1 Samuel","8","4","So all the elders of Israel gathered together and came to Samuel at Ramah. "
"8990","1 Samuel","8","5","They said to him, “You are old, and your sons do not follow your ways; now appoint a king to lead8:5 Traditionally judge; also in verses 6 and 20 us, such as all the other nations have.”"
"8991","1 Samuel","8","6","But when they said, “Give us a king to lead us,” this displeased Samuel; so he prayed to the Lord. "
"8992","1 Samuel","8","7","And the Lord told him: “Listen to all that the people are saying to you; it is not you they have rejected, but they have rejected me as their king. "
"8993","1 Samuel","8","8","As they have done from the day I brought them up out of Egypt until this day, forsaking me and serving other gods, so they are doing to you. "
"8994","1 Samuel","8","9","Now listen to them; but warn them solemnly and let them know what the king who will reign over them will claim as his rights.”"
"8995","1 Samuel","8","10","Samuel told all the words of the Lord to the people who were asking him for a king. "
"8996","1 Samuel","8","11","He said, “This is what the king who will reign over you will claim as his rights: He will take your sons and make them serve with his chariots and horses, and they will run in front of his chariots. "
"8997","1 Samuel","8","12","Some he will assign to be commanders of thousands and commanders of fifties, and others to plow his ground and reap his harvest, and still others to make weapons of war and equipment for his chariots. "
"8998","1 Samuel","8","13","He will take your daughters to be perfumers and cooks and bakers. "
"8999","1 Samuel","8","14","He will take the best of your fields and vineyards and olive groves and give them to his attendants. "
"9000","1 Samuel","8","15","He will take a tenth of your grain and of your vintage and give it to his officials and attendants. "
"9001","1 Samuel","8","16","Your male and female servants and the best of your cattle8:16 Septuagint; Hebrew young men and donkeys he will take for his own use. "
"9002","1 Samuel","8","17","He will take a tenth of your flocks, and you yourselves will become his slaves. "
"9003","1 Samuel","8","18","When that day comes, you will cry out for relief from the king you have chosen, but the Lord will not answer you in that day.”"
"9004","1 Samuel","8","19","But the people refused to listen to Samuel. “No!” they said. “We want a king over us. "
"9005","1 Samuel","8","20","Then we will be like all the other nations, with a king to lead us and to go out before us and fight our battles.”"
"9006","1 Samuel","8","21","When Samuel heard all that the people said, he repeated it before the Lord. "
"9007","1 Samuel","8","22","The Lord answered, “Listen to them and give them a king.”Then Samuel said to the Israelites, “Everyone go back to your own town.”"
"9008","1 Samuel","9","1","There was a Benjamite, a man of standing, whose name was Kish son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Bekorath, the son of Aphiah of Benjamin. "
"9009","1 Samuel","9","2","Kish had a son named Saul, as handsome a young man as could be found anywhere in Israel, and he was a head taller than anyone else."
"9010","1 Samuel","9","3","Now the donkeys belonging to Saul’s father Kish were lost, and Kish said to his son Saul, “Take one of the servants with you and go and look for the donkeys.” "
"9011","1 Samuel","9","4","So he passed through the hill country of Ephraim and through the area around Shalisha, but they did not find them. They went on into the district of Shaalim, but the donkeys were not there. Then he passed through the territory of Benjamin, but they did not find them."
"9012","1 Samuel","9","5","When they reached the district of Zuph, Saul said to the servant who was with him, “Come, let’s go back, or my father will stop thinking about the donkeys and start worrying about us.”"
"9013","1 Samuel","9","6","But the servant replied, “Look, in this town there is a man of God; he is highly respected, and everything he says comes true. Let’s go there now. Perhaps he will tell us what way to take.”"
"9014","1 Samuel","9","7","Saul said to his servant, “If we go, what can we give the man? The food in our sacks is gone. We have no gift to take to the man of God. What do we have?”"
"9015","1 Samuel","9","8","The servant answered him again. “Look,” he said, “I have a quarter of a shekel9:8 That is, about 1/10 ounce or about 3 grams of silver. I will give it to the man of God so that he will tell us what way to take.” 9(Formerly in Israel, if someone went to inquire of God, they would say, “Come, let us go to the seer,” because the prophet of today used to be called a seer.) "
"9016","1 Samuel","9","10","""Good,” Saul said to his servant. “Come, let’s go.” So they set out for the town where the man of God was."
"9017","1 Samuel","9","11","As they were going up the hill to the town, they met some young women coming out to draw water, and they asked them, “Is the seer here?” "
"9018","1 Samuel","9","12","""He is,” they answered. “He’s ahead of you. Hurry now; he has just come to our town today, for the people have a sacrifice at the high place. "
"9019","1 Samuel","9","13","As soon as you enter the town, you will find him before he goes up to the high place to eat. The people will not begin eating until he comes, because he must bless the sacrifice; afterward, those who are invited will eat. Go up now; you should find him about this time.”"
"9020","1 Samuel","9","14","They went up to the town, and as they were entering it, there was Samuel, coming toward them on his way up to the high place."
"9021","1 Samuel","9","15","Now the day before Saul came, the Lord had revealed this to Samuel:  "
"9022","1 Samuel","9","16","""About this time tomorrow I will send you a man from the land of Benjamin. Anoint him ruler over my people Israel; he will deliver them from the hand of the Philistines. I have looked on my people, for their cry has reached me.”"
"9023","1 Samuel","9","17","When Samuel caught sight of Saul, the Lord said to him, “This is the man I spoke to you about; he will govern my people.”"
"9024","1 Samuel","9","18","Saul approached Samuel in the gateway and asked, “Would you please tell me where the seer’s house is?” "
"9025","1 Samuel","9","19","""I am the seer,” Samuel replied. “Go up ahead of me to the high place, for today you are to eat with me, and in the morning I will send you on your way and will tell you all that is in your heart. "
"9026","1 Samuel","9","20","As for the donkeys you lost three days ago, do not worry about them; they have been found. And to whom is all the desire of Israel turned, if not to you and your whole family line?”"
"9027","1 Samuel","9","21","Saul answered, “But am I not a Benjamite, from the smallest tribe of Israel, and is not my clan the least of all the clans of the tribe of Benjamin? Why do you say such a thing to me?”"
"9028","1 Samuel","9","22","Then Samuel brought Saul and his servant into the hall and seated them at the head of those who were invited—about thirty in number. "
"9029","1 Samuel","9","23","Samuel said to the cook, “Bring the piece of meat I gave you, the one I told you to lay aside.”"
"9030","1 Samuel","9","24","So the cook took up the thigh with what was on it and set it in front of Saul. Samuel said, “Here is what has been kept for you. Eat, because it was set aside for you for this occasion from the time I said, ‘I have invited guests.’ ” And Saul dined with Samuel that day."
"9031","1 Samuel","9","25","After they came down from the high place to the town, Samuel talked with Saul on the roof of his house. "
"9032","1 Samuel","9","26","They rose about daybreak, and Samuel called to Saul on the roof, “Get ready, and I will send you on your way.” When Saul got ready, he and Samuel went outside together. "
"9033","1 Samuel","9","27","As they were going down to the edge of the town, Samuel said to Saul, “Tell the servant to go on ahead of us”—and the servant did so—“but you stay here for a while, so that I may give you a message from God.”"
"9034","1 Samuel","10","1","Then Samuel took a flask of olive oil and poured it on Saul’s head and kissed him, saying, “Has not the Lord anointed you ruler over his inheritance?10:1 Hebrew; Septuagint and Vulgate over his people Israel? You will reign over the Lord’s people and save them from the power of their enemies round about. And this will be a sign to you that the Lord has anointed you ruler over his inheritance: "
"9035","1 Samuel","10","2","When you leave me today, you will meet two men near Rachel’s tomb, at Zelzah on the border of Benjamin. They will say to you, ‘The donkeys you set out to look for have been found. And now your father has stopped thinking about them and is worried about you. He is asking, “What shall I do about my son?” ’ "
"9036","1 Samuel","10","3","""Then you will go on from there until you reach the great tree of Tabor. Three men going up to worship God at Bethel will meet you there. One will be carrying three young goats, another three loaves of bread, and another a skin of wine. "
"9037","1 Samuel","10","4","They will greet you and offer you two loaves of bread, which you will accept from them. "
"9038","1 Samuel","10","5","""After that you will go to Gibeah of God, where there is a Philistine outpost. As you approach the town, you will meet a procession of prophets coming down from the high place with lyres, timbrels, pipes and harps being played before them, and they will be prophesying. "
"9039","1 Samuel","10","6","The Spirit of the Lord will come powerfully upon you, and you will prophesy with them; and you will be changed into a different person. "
"9040","1 Samuel","10","7","Once these signs are fulfilled, do whatever your hand finds to do, for God is with you. "
"9041","1 Samuel","10","8","""Go down ahead of me to Gilgal. I will surely come down to you to sacrifice burnt offerings and fellowship offerings, but you must wait seven days until I come to you and tell you what you are to do.”Saul Made King"
"9042","1 Samuel","10","9","As Saul turned to leave Samuel, God changed Saul’s heart, and all these signs were fulfilled that day. "
"9043","1 Samuel","10","10","When he and his servant arrived at Gibeah, a procession of prophets met him; the Spirit of God came powerfully upon him, and he joined in their prophesying. "
"9044","1 Samuel","10","11","When all those who had formerly known him saw him prophesying with the prophets, they asked each other, “What is this that has happened to the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?”"
"9045","1 Samuel","10","12","A man who lived there answered, “And who is their father?” So it became a saying: “Is Saul also among the prophets?” "
"9046","1 Samuel","10","13","After Saul stopped prophesying, he went to the high place."
"9047","1 Samuel","10","14","Now Saul’s uncle asked him and his servant, “Where have you been?”“Looking for the donkeys,” he said. “But when we saw they were not to be found, we went to Samuel.”"
"9048","1 Samuel","10","15","Saul’s uncle said, “Tell me what Samuel said to you.”"
"9049","1 Samuel","10","16","Saul replied, “He assured us that the donkeys had been found.” But he did not tell his uncle what Samuel had said about the kingship."
"9050","1 Samuel","10","17","Samuel summoned the people of Israel to the Lord at Mizpah "
"9051","1 Samuel","10","18","and said to them, “This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: ‘I brought Israel up out of Egypt, and I delivered you from the power of Egypt and all the kingdoms that oppressed you.’ "
"9052","1 Samuel","10","19","But you have now rejected your God, who saves you out of all your disasters and calamities. And you have said, ‘No, appoint a king over us.’ So now present yourselves before the Lord by your tribes and clans.”"
"9053","1 Samuel","10","20","When Samuel had all Israel come forward by tribes, the tribe of Benjamin was taken by lot. "
"9054","1 Samuel","10","21","Then he brought forward the tribe of Benjamin, clan by clan, and Matri’s clan was taken. Finally Saul son of Kish was taken. But when they looked for him, he was not to be found. "
"9055","1 Samuel","10","22","So they inquired further of the Lord, “Has the man come here yet?”And the Lord said, “Yes, he has hidden himself among the supplies.”"
"9056","1 Samuel","10","23","They ran and brought him out, and as he stood among the people he was a head taller than any of the others. "
"9057","1 Samuel","10","24","Samuel said to all the people, “Do you see the man the Lord has chosen? There is no one like him among all the people.”Then the people shouted, “Long live the king!”"
"9058","1 Samuel","10","25","Samuel explained to the people the rights and duties of kingship. He wrote them down on a scroll and deposited it before the Lord. Then Samuel dismissed the people to go to their own homes."
"9059","1 Samuel","10","26","Saul also went to his home in Gibeah, accompanied by valiant men whose hearts God had touched. "
"9060","1 Samuel","10","27","But some scoundrels said, “How can this fellow save us?” They despised him and brought him no gifts. But Saul kept silent."
"9061","1 Samuel","11","1","Nahash11:1 Masoretic Text; Dead Sea Scrolls gifts. Now Nahash king of the Ammonites oppressed the Gadites and Reubenites severely. He gouged out all their right eyes and struck terror and dread in Israel. Not a man remained among the Israelites beyond the Jordan whose right eye was not gouged out by Nahash king of the Ammonites, except that seven thousand men fled from the Ammonites and entered Jabesh Gilead. About a month later, 1 Nahash the Ammonite went up and besieged Jabesh Gilead. And all the men of Jabesh said to him, “Make a treaty with us, and we will be subject to you.”"
"9062","1 Samuel","11","2","But Nahash the Ammonite replied, “I will make a treaty with you only on the condition that I gouge out the right eye of every one of you and so bring disgrace on all Israel.”"
"9063","1 Samuel","11","3","The elders of Jabesh said to him, “Give us seven days so we can send messengers throughout Israel; if no one comes to rescue us, we will surrender to you.”"
"9064","1 Samuel","11","4","When the messengers came to Gibeah of Saul and reported these terms to the people, they all wept aloud. "
"9065","1 Samuel","11","5","Just then Saul was returning from the fields, behind his oxen, and he asked, “What is wrong with everyone? Why are they weeping?” Then they repeated to him what the men of Jabesh had said."
"9066","1 Samuel","11","6","When Saul heard their words, the Spirit of God came powerfully upon him, and he burned with anger. "
"9067","1 Samuel","11","7","He took a pair of oxen, cut them into pieces, and sent the pieces by messengers throughout Israel, proclaiming, “This is what will be done to the oxen of anyone who does not follow Saul and Samuel.” Then the terror of the Lord fell on the people, and they came out together as one. "
"9068","1 Samuel","11","8","When Saul mustered them at Bezek, the men of Israel numbered three hundred thousand and those of Judah thirty thousand."
"9069","1 Samuel","11","9","They told the messengers who had come, “Say to the men of Jabesh Gilead, ‘By the time the sun is hot tomorrow, you will be rescued.’ ” When the messengers went and reported this to the men of Jabesh, they were elated. "
"9070","1 Samuel","11","10","They said to the Ammonites, “Tomorrow we will surrender to you, and you can do to us whatever you like.”"
"9071","1 Samuel","11","11","The next day Saul separated his men into three divisions; during the last watch of the night they broke into the camp of the Ammonites and slaughtered them until the heat of the day. Those who survived were scattered, so that no two of them were left together.Saul Confirmed as King"
"9072","1 Samuel","11","12","The people then said to Samuel, “Who was it that asked, ‘Shall Saul reign over us?’ Turn these men over to us so that we may put them to death.”"
"9073","1 Samuel","11","13","But Saul said, “No one will be put to death today, for this day the Lord has rescued Israel.”"
"9074","1 Samuel","11","14","Then Samuel said to the people, “Come, let us go to Gilgal and there renew the kingship.” "
"9075","1 Samuel","11","15","So all the people went to Gilgal and made Saul king in the presence of the Lord. There they sacrificed fellowship offerings before the Lord, and Saul and all the Israelites held a great celebration."
"9076","1 Samuel","12","1","Samuel said to all Israel, “I have listened to everything you said to me and have set a king over you. "
"9077","1 Samuel","12","2","Now you have a king as your leader. As for me, I am old and gray, and my sons are here with you. I have been your leader from my youth until this day. "
"9078","1 Samuel","12","3","Here I stand. Testify against me in the presence of the Lord and his anointed. Whose ox have I taken? Whose donkey have I taken? Whom have I cheated? Whom have I oppressed? From whose hand have I accepted a bribe to make me shut my eyes? If I have done any of these things, I will make it right.” "
"9079","1 Samuel","12","4","""You have not cheated or oppressed us,” they replied. “You have not taken anything from anyone’s hand.”"
"9080","1 Samuel","12","5","Samuel said to them, “The Lord is witness against you, and also his anointed is witness this day, that you have not found anything in my hand.”“He is witness,” they said."
"9081","1 Samuel","12","6","Then Samuel said to the people, “It is the Lord who appointed Moses and Aaron and brought your ancestors up out of Egypt. "
"9082","1 Samuel","12","7","Now then, stand here, because I am going to confront you with evidence before the Lord as to all the righteous acts performed by the Lord for you and your ancestors. "
"9083","1 Samuel","12","8","""After Jacob entered Egypt, they cried to the Lord for help, and the Lord sent Moses and Aaron, who brought your ancestors out of Egypt and settled them in this place. "
"9084","1 Samuel","12","9","""But they forgot the Lord their God; so he sold them into the hand of Sisera, the commander of the army of Hazor, and into the hands of the Philistines and the king of Moab, who fought against them. "
"9085","1 Samuel","12","10","They cried out to the Lord and said, ‘We have sinned; we have forsaken the Lord and served the Baals and the Ashtoreths. But now deliver us from the hands of our enemies, and we will serve you.’ "
"9086","1 Samuel","12","11","Then the Lord sent Jerub-Baal,12:11 Also called Gideon Barak,12:11 Some Septuagint manuscripts and Syriac; Hebrew Bedan Jephthah and Samuel,12:11 Hebrew; some Septuagint manuscripts and Syriac Samson and he delivered you from the hands of your enemies all around you, so that you lived in safety. "
"9087","1 Samuel","12","12","""But when you saw that Nahash king of the Ammonites was moving against you, you said to me, ‘No, we want a king to rule over us’—even though the Lord your God was your king. "
"9088","1 Samuel","12","13","Now here is the king you have chosen, the one you asked for; see, the Lord has set a king over you. "
"9089","1 Samuel","12","14","If you fear the Lord and serve and obey him and do not rebel against his commands, and if both you and the king who reigns over you follow the Lord your God—good! "
"9090","1 Samuel","12","15","But if you do not obey the Lord, and if you rebel against his commands, his hand will be against you, as it was against your ancestors. "
"9091","1 Samuel","12","16","""Now then, stand still and see this great thing the Lord is about to do before your eyes! "
"9092","1 Samuel","12","17","Is it not wheat harvest now? I will call on the Lord to send thunder and rain. And you will realize what an evil thing you did in the eyes of the Lord when you asked for a king.”"
"9093","1 Samuel","12","18","Then Samuel called on the Lord, and that same day the Lord sent thunder and rain. So all the people stood in awe of the Lord and of Samuel."
"9094","1 Samuel","12","19","The people all said to Samuel, “Pray to the Lord your God for your servants so that we will not die, for we have added to all our other sins the evil of asking for a king.” "
"9095","1 Samuel","12","20","""Do not be afraid,” Samuel replied. “You have done all this evil; yet do not turn away from the Lord, but serve the Lord with all your heart. "
"9096","1 Samuel","12","21","Do not turn away after useless idols. They can do you no good, nor can they rescue you, because they are useless. "
"9097","1 Samuel","12","22","For the sake of his great name the Lord will not reject his people, because the Lord was pleased to make you his own. "
"9098","1 Samuel","12","23","As for me, far be it from me that I should sin against the Lord by failing to pray for you. And I will teach you the way that is good and right. "
"9099","1 Samuel","12","24","But be sure to fear the Lord and serve him faithfully with all your heart; consider what great things he has done for you. "
"9100","1 Samuel","12","25","Yet if you persist in doing evil, both you and your king will perish.”"
"9101","1 Samuel","13","1","Saul was thirty13:1 A few late manuscripts of the Septuagint; Hebrew does not have thirty. years old when he became king, and he reigned over Israel forty-13:1 Probable reading of the original Hebrew text (see Acts 13:21); Masoretic Text does not have forty-. two years."
"9102","1 Samuel","13","2","Saul chose three thousand men from Israel; two thousand were with him at Mikmash and in the hill country of Bethel, and a thousand were with Jonathan at Gibeah in Benjamin. The rest of the men he sent back to their homes."
"9103","1 Samuel","13","3","Jonathan attacked the Philistine outpost at Geba, and the Philistines heard about it. Then Saul had the trumpet blown throughout the land and said, “Let the Hebrews hear!” "
"9104","1 Samuel","13","4","So all Israel heard the news: “Saul has attacked the Philistine outpost, and now Israel has become obnoxious to the Philistines.” And the people were summoned to join Saul at Gilgal."
"9105","1 Samuel","13","5","The Philistines assembled to fight Israel, with three thousand13:5 Some Septuagint manuscripts and Syriac; Hebrew thirty thousand chariots, six thousand charioteers, and soldiers as numerous as the sand on the seashore. They went up and camped at Mikmash, east of Beth Aven. "
"9106","1 Samuel","13","6","When the Israelites saw that their situation was critical and that their army was hard pressed, they hid in caves and thickets, among the rocks, and in pits and cisterns. "
"9107","1 Samuel","13","7","Some Hebrews even crossed the Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead.Saul remained at Gilgal, and all the troops with him were quaking with fear. "
"9108","1 Samuel","13","8","He waited seven days, the time set by Samuel; but Samuel did not come to Gilgal, and Saul’s men began to scatter. "
"9109","1 Samuel","13","9","So he said, “Bring me the burnt offering and the fellowship offerings.” And Saul offered up the burnt offering. "
"9110","1 Samuel","13","10","Just as he finished making the offering, Samuel arrived, and Saul went out to greet him. "
"9111","1 Samuel","13","11","""What have you done?” asked Samuel.Saul replied, “When I saw that the men were scattering, and that you did not come at the set time, and that the Philistines were assembling at Mikmash, "
"9112","1 Samuel","13","12","I thought, ‘Now the Philistines will come down against me at Gilgal, and I have not sought the Lord’s favor.’ So I felt compelled to offer the burnt offering.” "
"9113","1 Samuel","13","13","""You have done a foolish thing,” Samuel said. “You have not kept the command the Lord your God gave you; if you had, he would have established your kingdom over Israel for all time. "
"9114","1 Samuel","13","14","But now your kingdom will not endure; the Lord has sought out a man after his own heart and appointed him ruler of his people, because you have not kept the Lord’s command.”"
"9115","1 Samuel","13","15","Then Samuel left Gilgal13:15 Hebrew; Septuagint Gilgal and went his way; the rest of the people went after Saul to meet the army, and they went out of Gilgal and went up to Gibeah in Benjamin, and Saul counted the men who were with him. They numbered about six hundred.Israel Without Weapons"
"9116","1 Samuel","13","16","Saul and his son Jonathan and the men with them were staying in Gibeah13:16 Two Hebrew manuscripts; most Hebrew manuscripts Geba, a variant of Gibeah in Benjamin, while the Philistines camped at Mikmash. "
"9117","1 Samuel","13","17","Raiding parties went out from the Philistine camp in three detachments. One turned toward Ophrah in the vicinity of Shual, "
"9118","1 Samuel","13","18","another toward Beth Horon, and the third toward the borderland overlooking the Valley of Zeboyim facing the wilderness."
"9119","1 Samuel","13","19","Not a blacksmith could be found in the whole land of Israel, because the Philistines had said, “Otherwise the Hebrews will make swords or spears!” "
"9120","1 Samuel","13","20","So all Israel went down to the Philistines to have their plow points, mattocks, axes and sickles13:20 Septuagint; Hebrew plow points sharpened. "
"9121","1 Samuel","13","21","The price was two-thirds of a shekel13:21 That is, about 1/4 ounce or about 8 grams for sharpening plow points and mattocks, and a third of a shekel13:21 That is, about 1/8 ounce or about 4 grams for sharpening forks and axes and for repointing goads."
"9122","1 Samuel","13","22","So on the day of the battle not a soldier with Saul and Jonathan had a sword or spear in his hand; only Saul and his son Jonathan had them.Jonathan Attacks the Philistines"
"9123","1 Samuel","13","23","Now a detachment of Philistines had gone out to the pass at Mikmash."
"9124","1 Samuel","14","1","One day Jonathan son of Saul said to his young armor-bearer, “Come, let’s go over to the Philistine outpost on the other side.” But he did not tell his father."
"9125","1 Samuel","14","2","Saul was staying on the outskirts of Gibeah under a pomegranate tree in Migron. With him were about six hundred men, "
"9126","1 Samuel","14","3","among whom was Ahijah, who was wearing an ephod. He was a son of Ichabod’s brother Ahitub son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the Lord’s priest in Shiloh. No one was aware that Jonathan had left."
"9127","1 Samuel","14","4","On each side of the pass that Jonathan intended to cross to reach the Philistine outpost was a cliff; one was called Bozez and the other Seneh. "
"9128","1 Samuel","14","5","One cliff stood to the north toward Mikmash, the other to the south toward Geba."
"9129","1 Samuel","14","6","Jonathan said to his young armor-bearer, “Come, let’s go over to the outpost of those uncircumcised men. Perhaps the Lord will act in our behalf. Nothing can hinder the Lord from saving, whether by many or by few.” "
"9130","1 Samuel","14","7","""Do all that you have in mind,” his armor-bearer said. “Go ahead; I am with you heart and soul.”"
"9131","1 Samuel","14","8","Jonathan said, “Come on, then; we will cross over toward them and let them see us. "
"9132","1 Samuel","14","9","If they say to us, ‘Wait there until we come to you,’ we will stay where we are and not go up to them. "
"9133","1 Samuel","14","10","But if they say, ‘Come up to us,’ we will climb up, because that will be our sign that the Lord has given them into our hands.”"
"9134","1 Samuel","14","11","So both of them showed themselves to the Philistine outpost. “Look!” said the Philistines. “The Hebrews are crawling out of the holes they were hiding in.” "
"9135","1 Samuel","14","12","The men of the outpost shouted to Jonathan and his armor-bearer, “Come up to us and we’ll teach you a lesson.”So Jonathan said to his armor-bearer, “Climb up after me; the Lord has given them into the hand of Israel.”"
"9136","1 Samuel","14","13","Jonathan climbed up, using his hands and feet, with his armor-bearer right behind him. The Philistines fell before Jonathan, and his armor-bearer followed and killed behind him. "
"9137","1 Samuel","14","14","In that first attack Jonathan and his armor-bearer killed some twenty men in an area of about half an acre.Israel Routs the Philistines"
"9138","1 Samuel","14","15","Then panic struck the whole army—those in the camp and field, and those in the outposts and raiding parties—and the ground shook. It was a panic sent by God.14:15 Or a terrible panic"
"9139","1 Samuel","14","16","Saul’s lookouts at Gibeah in Benjamin saw the army melting away in all directions. "
"9140","1 Samuel","14","17","Then Saul said to the men who were with him, “Muster the forces and see who has left us.” When they did, it was Jonathan and his armor-bearer who were not there."
"9141","1 Samuel","14","18","Saul said to Ahijah, “Bring the ark of God.” (At that time it was with the Israelites.)14:18 Hebrew; Septuagint “Bring the ephod.” (At that time he wore the ephod before the Israelites.) "
"9142","1 Samuel","14","19","While Saul was talking to the priest, the tumult in the Philistine camp increased more and more. So Saul said to the priest, “Withdraw your hand.”"
"9143","1 Samuel","14","20","Then Saul and all his men assembled and went to the battle. They found the Philistines in total confusion, striking each other with their swords. "
"9144","1 Samuel","14","21","Those Hebrews who had previously been with the Philistines and had gone up with them to their camp went over to the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan. "
"9145","1 Samuel","14","22","When all the Israelites who had hidden in the hill country of Ephraim heard that the Philistines were on the run, they joined the battle in hot pursuit. "
"9146","1 Samuel","14","23","So on that day the Lord saved Israel, and the battle moved on beyond Beth Aven.Jonathan Eats Honey"
"9147","1 Samuel","14","24","Now the Israelites were in distress that day, because Saul had bound the people under an oath, saying, “Cursed be anyone who eats food before evening comes, before I have avenged myself on my enemies!” So none of the troops tasted food."
"9148","1 Samuel","14","25","The entire army entered the woods, and there was honey on the ground. "
"9149","1 Samuel","14","26","When they went into the woods, they saw the honey oozing out; yet no one put his hand to his mouth, because they feared the oath. "
"9150","1 Samuel","14","27","But Jonathan had not heard that his father had bound the people with the oath, so he reached out the end of the staff that was in his hand and dipped it into the honeycomb. He raised his hand to his mouth, and his eyes brightened.14:27 Or his strength was renewed; similarly in verse 29 "
"9151","1 Samuel","14","28","Then one of the soldiers told him, “Your father bound the army under a strict oath, saying, ‘Cursed be anyone who eats food today!’ That is why the men are faint.”"
"9152","1 Samuel","14","29","Jonathan said, “My father has made trouble for the country. See how my eyes brightened when I tasted a little of this honey. "
"9153","1 Samuel","14","30","How much better it would have been if the men had eaten today some of the plunder they took from their enemies. Would not the slaughter of the Philistines have been even greater?”"
"9154","1 Samuel","14","31","That day, after the Israelites had struck down the Philistines from Mikmash to Aijalon, they were exhausted. "
"9155","1 Samuel","14","32","They pounced on the plunder and, taking sheep, cattle and calves, they butchered them on the ground and ate them, together with the blood. "
"9156","1 Samuel","14","33","Then someone said to Saul, “Look, the men are sinning against the Lord by eating meat that has blood in it.”“You have broken faith,” he said. “Roll a large stone over here at once.” "
"9157","1 Samuel","14","34","Then he said, “Go out among the men and tell them, ‘Each of you bring me your cattle and sheep, and slaughter them here and eat them. Do not sin against the Lord by eating meat with blood still in it.’ ”So everyone brought his ox that night and slaughtered it there. "
"9158","1 Samuel","14","35","Then Saul built an altar to the Lord; it was the first time he had done this."
"9159","1 Samuel","14","36","Saul said, “Let us go down and pursue the Philistines by night and plunder them till dawn, and let us not leave one of them alive.”“Do whatever seems best to you,” they replied.But the priest said, “Let us inquire of God here.”"
"9160","1 Samuel","14","37","So Saul asked God, “Shall I go down and pursue the Philistines? Will you give them into Israel’s hand?” But God did not answer him that day."
"9161","1 Samuel","14","38","Saul therefore said, “Come here, all you who are leaders of the army, and let us find out what sin has been committed today. "
"9162","1 Samuel","14","39","As surely as the Lord who rescues Israel lives, even if the guilt lies with my son Jonathan, he must die.” But not one of them said a word."
"9163","1 Samuel","14","40","Saul then said to all the Israelites, “You stand over there; I and Jonathan my son will stand over here.”“Do what seems best to you,” they replied."
"9164","1 Samuel","14","41","Then Saul prayed to the Lord, the God of Israel, “Why have you not answered your servant today? If the fault is in me or my son Jonathan, respond with Urim, but if the men of Israel are at fault,14:41 Septuagint; Hebrew does not have “Why… at fault. respond with Thummim.” Jonathan and Saul were taken by lot, and the men were cleared. "
"9165","1 Samuel","14","42","Saul said, “Cast the lot between me and Jonathan my son.” And Jonathan was taken."
"9166","1 Samuel","14","43","Then Saul said to Jonathan, “Tell me what you have done.”So Jonathan told him, “I tasted a little honey with the end of my staff. And now I must die!”"
"9167","1 Samuel","14","44","Saul said, “May God deal with me, be it ever so severely, if you do not die, Jonathan.”"
"9168","1 Samuel","14","45","But the men said to Saul, “Should Jonathan die—he who has brought about this great deliverance in Israel? Never! As surely as the Lord lives, not a hair of his head will fall to the ground, for he did this today with God’s help.” So the men rescued Jonathan, and he was not put to death."
"9169","1 Samuel","14","46","Then Saul stopped pursuing the Philistines, and they withdrew to their own land."
"9170","1 Samuel","14","47","After Saul had assumed rule over Israel, he fought against their enemies on every side: Moab, the Ammonites, Edom, the kings14:47 Masoretic Text; Dead Sea Scrolls and Septuagint king of Zobah, and the Philistines. Wherever he turned, he inflicted punishment on them.14:47 Hebrew; Septuagint he was victorious "
"9171","1 Samuel","14","48","He fought valiantly and defeated the Amalekites, delivering Israel from the hands of those who had plundered them.Saul’s Family"
"9172","1 Samuel","14","49","Saul’s sons were Jonathan, Ishvi and Malki-Shua. The name of his older daughter was Merab, and that of the younger was Michal. "
"9173","1 Samuel","14","50","His wife’s name was Ahinoam daughter of Ahimaaz. The name of the commander of Saul’s army was Abner son of Ner, and Ner was Saul’s uncle. "
"9174","1 Samuel","14","51","Saul’s father Kish and Abner’s father Ner were sons of Abiel."
"9175","1 Samuel","14","52","All the days of Saul there was bitter war with the Philistines, and whenever Saul saw a mighty or brave man, he took him into his service."
"9176","1 Samuel","15","1","Samuel said to Saul, “I am the one the Lord sent to anoint you king over his people Israel; so listen now to the message from the Lord. "
"9177","1 Samuel","15","2","This is what the Lord Almighty says: ‘I will punish the Amalekites for what they did to Israel when they waylaid them as they came up from Egypt. "
"9178","1 Samuel","15","3","Now go, attack the Amalekites and totally destroy15:3 The Hebrew term refers to the irrevocable giving over of things or persons to the Lord, often by totally destroying them; also in verses 8, 9, 15, 18, 20 and 21. all that belongs to them. Do not spare them; put to death men and women, children and infants, cattle and sheep, camels and donkeys.’ ”"
"9179","1 Samuel","15","4","So Saul summoned the men and mustered them at Telaim—two hundred thousand foot soldiers and ten thousand from Judah. "
"9180","1 Samuel","15","5","Saul went to the city of Amalek and set an ambush in the ravine. "
"9181","1 Samuel","15","6","Then he said to the Kenites, “Go away, leave the Amalekites so that I do not destroy you along with them; for you showed kindness to all the Israelites when they came up out of Egypt.” So the Kenites moved away from the Amalekites."
"9182","1 Samuel","15","7","Then Saul attacked the Amalekites all the way from Havilah to Shur, near the eastern border of Egypt. "
"9183","1 Samuel","15","8","He took Agag king of the Amalekites alive, and all his people he totally destroyed with the sword. "
"9184","1 Samuel","15","9","But Saul and the army spared Agag and the best of the sheep and cattle, the fat calves15:9 Or the grown bulls; the meaning of the Hebrew for this phrase is uncertain. and lambs—everything that was good. These they were unwilling to destroy completely, but everything that was despised and weak they totally destroyed."
"9185","1 Samuel","15","10","Then the word of the Lord came to Samuel:  "
"9186","1 Samuel","15","11","""I regret that I have made Saul king, because he has turned away from me and has not carried out my instructions.” Samuel was angry, and he cried out to the Lord all that night."
"9187","1 Samuel","15","12","Early in the morning Samuel got up and went to meet Saul, but he was told, “Saul has gone to Carmel. There he has set up a monument in his own honor and has turned and gone on down to Gilgal.”"
"9188","1 Samuel","15","13","When Samuel reached him, Saul said, “The Lord bless you! I have carried out the Lord’s instructions.”"
"9189","1 Samuel","15","14","But Samuel said, “What then is this bleating of sheep in my ears? What is this lowing of cattle that I hear?”"
"9190","1 Samuel","15","15","Saul answered, “The soldiers brought them from the Amalekites; they spared the best of the sheep and cattle to sacrifice to the Lord your God, but we totally destroyed the rest.” "
"9191","1 Samuel","15","16","""Enough!” Samuel said to Saul. “Let me tell you what the Lord said to me last night.”“Tell me,” Saul replied."
"9192","1 Samuel","15","17","Samuel said, “Although you were once small in your own eyes, did you not become the head of the tribes of Israel? The Lord anointed you king over Israel. "
"9193","1 Samuel","15","18","And he sent you on a mission, saying, ‘Go and completely destroy those wicked people, the Amalekites; wage war against them until you have wiped them out.’ "
"9194","1 Samuel","15","19","Why did you not obey the Lord? Why did you pounce on the plunder and do evil in the eyes of the Lord?” "
"9195","1 Samuel","15","20","""But I did obey the Lord,” Saul said. “I went on the mission the Lord assigned me. I completely destroyed the Amalekites and brought back Agag their king. "
"9196","1 Samuel","15","21","The soldiers took sheep and cattle from the plunder, the best of what was devoted to God, in order to sacrifice them to the Lord your God at Gilgal.”"
"9197","1 Samuel","15","22","But Samuel replied:“Does the Lord delight in burnt offerings and sacrificesas much as in obeying the Lord?To obey is better than sacrifice,and to heed is better than the fat of rams."
"9198","1 Samuel","15","23","For rebellion is like the sin of divination,and arrogance like the evil of idolatry.Because you have rejected the word of the Lord,he has rejected you as king.”"
"9199","1 Samuel","15","24","Then Saul said to Samuel, “I have sinned. I violated the Lord’s command and your instructions. I was afraid of the men and so I gave in to them. "
"9200","1 Samuel","15","25","Now I beg you, forgive my sin and come back with me, so that I may worship the Lord.”"
"9201","1 Samuel","15","26","But Samuel said to him, “I will not go back with you. You have rejected the word of the Lord, and the Lord has rejected you as king over Israel!”"
"9202","1 Samuel","15","27","As Samuel turned to leave, Saul caught hold of the hem of his robe, and it tore. "
"9203","1 Samuel","15","28","Samuel said to him, “The Lord has torn the kingdom of Israel from you today and has given it to one of your neighbors—to one better than you. "
"9204","1 Samuel","15","29","He who is the Glory of Israel does not lie or change his mind; for he is not a human being, that he should change his mind.”"
"9205","1 Samuel","15","30","Saul replied, “I have sinned. But please honor me before the elders of my people and before Israel; come back with me, so that I may worship the Lord your God.” "
"9206","1 Samuel","15","31","So Samuel went back with Saul, and Saul worshiped the Lord."
"9207","1 Samuel","15","32","Then Samuel said, “Bring me Agag king of the Amalekites.”Agag came to him in chains.15:32 The meaning of the Hebrew for this phrase is uncertain. And he thought, “Surely the bitterness of death is past.”"
"9208","1 Samuel","15","33","But Samuel said,“As your sword has made women childless,so will your mother be childless among women.”And Samuel put Agag to death before the Lord at Gilgal."
"9209","1 Samuel","15","34","Then Samuel left for Ramah, but Saul went up to his home in Gibeah of Saul. "
"9210","1 Samuel","15","35","Until the day Samuel died, he did not go to see Saul again, though Samuel mourned for him. And the Lord regretted that he had made Saul king over Israel."
"9211","1 Samuel","16","1","The Lord said to Samuel, “How long will you mourn for Saul, since I have rejected him as king over Israel? Fill your horn with oil and be on your way; I am sending you to Jesse of Bethlehem. I have chosen one of his sons to be king.”"
"9212","1 Samuel","16","2","But Samuel said, “How can I go? If Saul hears about it, he will kill me.”The Lord said, “Take a heifer with you and say, ‘I have come to sacrifice to the Lord.’ "
"9213","1 Samuel","16","3","Invite Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show you what to do. You are to anoint for me the one I indicate.”"
"9214","1 Samuel","16","4","Samuel did what the Lord said. When he arrived at Bethlehem, the elders of the town trembled when they met him. They asked, “Do you come in peace?”"
"9215","1 Samuel","16","5","Samuel replied, “Yes, in peace; I have come to sacrifice to the Lord. Consecrate yourselves and come to the sacrifice with me.” Then he consecrated Jesse and his sons and invited them to the sacrifice."
"9216","1 Samuel","16","6","When they arrived, Samuel saw Eliab and thought, “Surely the Lord’s anointed stands here before the Lord.”"
"9217","1 Samuel","16","7","But the Lord said to Samuel, “Do not consider his appearance or his height, for I have rejected him. The Lord does not look at the things people look at. People look at the outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart.”"
"9218","1 Samuel","16","8","Then Jesse called Abinadab and had him pass in front of Samuel. But Samuel said, “The Lord has not chosen this one either.” "
"9219","1 Samuel","16","9","Jesse then had Shammah pass by, but Samuel said, “Nor has the Lord chosen this one.” "
"9220","1 Samuel","16","10","Jesse had seven of his sons pass before Samuel, but Samuel said to him, “The Lord has not chosen these.” "
"9221","1 Samuel","16","11","So he asked Jesse, “Are these all the sons you have?”“There is still the youngest,” Jesse answered. “He is tending the sheep.”Samuel said, “Send for him; we will not sit down until he arrives.”"
"9222","1 Samuel","16","12","So he sent for him and had him brought in. He was glowing with health and had a fine appearance and handsome features.Then the Lord said, “Rise and anoint him; this is the one.”"
"9223","1 Samuel","16","13","So Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the presence of his brothers, and from that day on the Spirit of the Lord came powerfully upon David. Samuel then went to Ramah.David in Saul’s Service"
"9224","1 Samuel","16","14","Now the Spirit of the Lord had departed from Saul, and an evil16:14 Or and a harmful; similarly in verses 15, 16 and 23 spirit from the Lord tormented him."
"9225","1 Samuel","16","15","Saul’s attendants said to him, “See, an evil spirit from God is tormenting you. "
"9226","1 Samuel","16","16","Let our lord command his servants here to search for someone who can play the lyre. He will play when the evil spirit from God comes on you, and you will feel better.”"
"9227","1 Samuel","16","17","So Saul said to his attendants, “Find someone who plays well and bring him to me.”"
"9228","1 Samuel","16","18","One of the servants answered, “I have seen a son of Jesse of Bethlehem who knows how to play the lyre. He is a brave man and a warrior. He speaks well and is a fine-looking man. And the Lord is with him.”"
"9229","1 Samuel","16","19","Then Saul sent messengers to Jesse and said, “Send me your son David, who is with the sheep.” "
"9230","1 Samuel","16","20","So Jesse took a donkey loaded with bread, a skin of wine and a young goat and sent them with his son David to Saul."
"9231","1 Samuel","16","21","David came to Saul and entered his service. Saul liked him very much, and David became one of his armor-bearers. "
"9232","1 Samuel","16","22","Then Saul sent word to Jesse, saying, “Allow David to remain in my service, for I am pleased with him.”"
"9233","1 Samuel","16","23","Whenever the spirit from God came on Saul, David would take up his lyre and play. Then relief would come to Saul; he would feel better, and the evil spirit would leave him."
"9234","1 Samuel","17","1","Now the Philistines gathered their forces for war and assembled at Sokoh in Judah. They pitched camp at Ephes Dammim, between Sokoh and Azekah. "
"9235","1 Samuel","17","2","Saul and the Israelites assembled and camped in the Valley of Elah and drew up their battle line to meet the Philistines. "
"9236","1 Samuel","17","3","The Philistines occupied one hill and the Israelites another, with the valley between them."
"9237","1 Samuel","17","4","A champion named Goliath, who was from Gath, came out of the Philistine camp. His height was six cubits and a span.17:4 That is, about 9 feet 9 inches or about 3 meters "
"9238","1 Samuel","17","5","He had a bronze helmet on his head and wore a coat of scale armor of bronze weighing five thousand shekels17:5 That is, about 125 pounds or about 58 kilograms; "
"9239","1 Samuel","17","6","on his legs he wore bronze greaves, and a bronze javelin was slung on his back. "
"9240","1 Samuel","17","7","His spear shaft was like a weaver’s rod, and its iron point weighed six hundred shekels.17:7 That is, about 15 pounds or about 6.9 kilograms His shield bearer went ahead of him."
"9241","1 Samuel","17","8","Goliath stood and shouted to the ranks of Israel, “Why do you come out and line up for battle? Am I not a Philistine, and are you not the servants of Saul? Choose a man and have him come down to me. "
"9242","1 Samuel","17","9","If he is able to fight and kill me, we will become your subjects; but if I overcome him and kill him, you will become our subjects and serve us.” "
"9243","1 Samuel","17","10","Then the Philistine said, “This day I defy the armies of Israel! Give me a man and let us fight each other.” "
"9244","1 Samuel","17","11","On hearing the Philistine’s words, Saul and all the Israelites were dismayed and terrified."
"9245","1 Samuel","17","12","Now David was the son of an Ephrathite named Jesse, who was from Bethlehem in Judah. Jesse had eight sons, and in Saul’s time he was very old. "
"9246","1 Samuel","17","13","Jesse’s three oldest sons had followed Saul to the war: The firstborn was Eliab; the second, Abinadab; and the third, Shammah. "
"9247","1 Samuel","17","14","David was the youngest. The three oldest followed Saul, "
"9248","1 Samuel","17","15","but David went back and forth from Saul to tend his father’s sheep at Bethlehem."
"9249","1 Samuel","17","16","For forty days the Philistine came forward every morning and evening and took his stand."
"9250","1 Samuel","17","17","Now Jesse said to his son David, “Take this ephah17:17 That is, probably about 36 pounds or about 16 kilograms of roasted grain and these ten loaves of bread for your brothers and hurry to their camp. "
"9251","1 Samuel","17","18","Take along these ten cheeses to the commander of their unit. See how your brothers are and bring back some assurance17:18 Or some token; or some pledge of spoils from them. "
"9252","1 Samuel","17","19","They are with Saul and all the men of Israel in the Valley of Elah, fighting against the Philistines.”"
"9253","1 Samuel","17","20","Early in the morning David left the flock in the care of a shepherd, loaded up and set out, as Jesse had directed. He reached the camp as the army was going out to its battle positions, shouting the war cry. "
"9254","1 Samuel","17","21","Israel and the Philistines were drawing up their lines facing each other. "
"9255","1 Samuel","17","22","David left his things with the keeper of supplies, ran to the battle lines and asked his brothers how they were. "
"9256","1 Samuel","17","23","As he was talking with them, Goliath, the Philistine champion from Gath, stepped out from his lines and shouted his usual defiance, and David heard it. "
"9257","1 Samuel","17","24","Whenever the Israelites saw the man, they all fled from him in great fear."
"9258","1 Samuel","17","25","Now the Israelites had been saying, “Do you see how this man keeps coming out? He comes out to defy Israel. The king will give great wealth to the man who kills him. He will also give him his daughter in marriage and will exempt his family from taxes in Israel.”"
"9259","1 Samuel","17","26","David asked the men standing near him, “What will be done for the man who kills this Philistine and removes this disgrace from Israel? Who is this uncircumcised Philistine that he should defy the armies of the living God?”"
"9260","1 Samuel","17","27","They repeated to him what they had been saying and told him, “This is what will be done for the man who kills him.”"
"9261","1 Samuel","17","28","When Eliab, David’s oldest brother, heard him speaking with the men, he burned with anger at him and asked, “Why have you come down here? And with whom did you leave those few sheep in the wilderness? I know how conceited you are and how wicked your heart is; you came down only to watch the battle.” "
"9262","1 Samuel","17","29","""Now what have I done?” said David. “Can’t I even speak?” "
"9263","1 Samuel","17","30","He then turned away to someone else and brought up the same matter, and the men answered him as before. "
"9264","1 Samuel","17","31","What David said was overheard and reported to Saul, and Saul sent for him."
"9265","1 Samuel","17","32","David said to Saul, “Let no one lose heart on account of this Philistine; your servant will go and fight him.”"
"9266","1 Samuel","17","33","Saul replied, “You are not able to go out against this Philistine and fight him; you are only a young man, and he has been a warrior from his youth.”"
"9267","1 Samuel","17","34","But David said to Saul, “Your servant has been keeping his father’s sheep. When a lion or a bear came and carried off a sheep from the flock, "
"9268","1 Samuel","17","35","I went after it, struck it and rescued the sheep from its mouth. When it turned on me, I seized it by its hair, struck it and killed it. "
"9269","1 Samuel","17","36","Your servant has killed both the lion and the bear; this uncircumcised Philistine will be like one of them, because he has defied the armies of the living God. "
"9270","1 Samuel","17","37","The Lord who rescued me from the paw of the lion and the paw of the bear will rescue me from the hand of this Philistine.”Saul said to David, “Go, and the Lord be with you.”"
"9271","1 Samuel","17","38","Then Saul dressed David in his own tunic. He put a coat of armor on him and a bronze helmet on his head. "
"9272","1 Samuel","17","39","David fastened on his sword over the tunic and tried walking around, because he was not used to them.“I cannot go in these,” he said to Saul, “because I am not used to them.” So he took them off. "
"9273","1 Samuel","17","40","Then he took his staff in his hand, chose five smooth stones from the stream, put them in the pouch of his shepherd’s bag and, with his sling in his hand, approached the Philistine."
"9274","1 Samuel","17","41","Meanwhile, the Philistine, with his shield bearer in front of him, kept coming closer to David. "
"9275","1 Samuel","17","42","He looked David over and saw that he was little more than a boy, glowing with health and handsome, and he despised him. "
"9276","1 Samuel","17","43","He said to David, “Am I a dog, that you come at me with sticks?” And the Philistine cursed David by his gods.  "
"9277","1 Samuel","17","44","""Come here,” he said, “and I’ll give your flesh to the birds and the wild animals!”"
"9278","1 Samuel","17","45","David said to the Philistine, “You come against me with sword and spear and javelin, but I come against you in the name of the Lord Almighty, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied. "
"9279","1 Samuel","17","46","This day the Lord will deliver you into my hands, and I’ll strike you down and cut off your head. This very day I will give the carcasses of the Philistine army to the birds and the wild animals, and the whole world will know that there is a God in Israel. "
"9280","1 Samuel","17","47","All those gathered here will know that it is not by sword or spear that the Lord saves; for the battle is the Lord’s, and he will give all of you into our hands.”"
"9281","1 Samuel","17","48","As the Philistine moved closer to attack him, David ran quickly toward the battle line to meet him. "
"9282","1 Samuel","17","49","Reaching into his bag and taking out a stone, he slung it and struck the Philistine on the forehead. The stone sank into his forehead, and he fell facedown on the ground."
"9283","1 Samuel","17","50","So David triumphed over the Philistine with a sling and a stone; without a sword in his hand he struck down the Philistine and killed him."
"9284","1 Samuel","17","51","David ran and stood over him. He took hold of the Philistine’s sword and drew it from the sheath. After he killed him, he cut off his head with the sword.When the Philistines saw that their hero was dead, they turned and ran. "
"9285","1 Samuel","17","52","Then the men of Israel and Judah surged forward with a shout and pursued the Philistines to the entrance of Gath17:52 Some Septuagint manuscripts; Hebrew of a valley and to the gates of Ekron. Their dead were strewn along the Shaaraim road to Gath and Ekron. "
"9286","1 Samuel","17","53","When the Israelites returned from chasing the Philistines, they plundered their camp."
"9287","1 Samuel","17","54","David took the Philistine’s head and brought it to Jerusalem; he put the Philistine’s weapons in his own tent."
"9288","1 Samuel","17","55","As Saul watched David going out to meet the Philistine, he said to Abner, commander of the army, “Abner, whose son is that young man?”Abner replied, “As surely as you live, Your Majesty, I don’t know.”"
"9289","1 Samuel","17","56","The king said, “Find out whose son this young man is.”"
"9290","1 Samuel","17","57","As soon as David returned from killing the Philistine, Abner took him and brought him before Saul, with David still holding the Philistine’s head. "
"9291","1 Samuel","17","58","""Whose son are you, young man?” Saul asked him.David said, “I am the son of your servant Jesse of Bethlehem.”"
"9292","1 Samuel","18","1","After David had finished talking with Saul, Jonathan became one in spirit with David, and he loved him as himself. "
"9293","1 Samuel","18","2","From that day Saul kept David with him and did not let him return home to his family. "
"9294","1 Samuel","18","3","And Jonathan made a covenant with David because he loved him as himself. "
"9295","1 Samuel","18","4","Jonathan took off the robe he was wearing and gave it to David, along with his tunic, and even his sword, his bow and his belt."
"9296","1 Samuel","18","5","Whatever mission Saul sent him on, David was so successful that Saul gave him a high rank in the army. This pleased all the troops, and Saul’s officers as well."
"9297","1 Samuel","18","6","When the men were returning home after David had killed the Philistine, the women came out from all the towns of Israel to meet King Saul with singing and dancing, with joyful songs and with timbrels and lyres. "
"9298","1 Samuel","18","7","As they danced, they sang:“Saul has slain his thousands,and David his tens of thousands.”"
"9299","1 Samuel","18","8","Saul was very angry; this refrain displeased him greatly. “They have credited David with tens of thousands,” he thought, “but me with only thousands. What more can he get but the kingdom?” "
"9300","1 Samuel","18","9","And from that time on Saul kept a close eye on David."
"9301","1 Samuel","18","10","The next day an evil18:10 Or a harmful spirit from God came forcefully on Saul. He was prophesying in his house, while David was playing the lyre, as he usually did. Saul had a spear in his hand "
"9302","1 Samuel","18","11","and he hurled it, saying to himself, “I’ll pin David to the wall.” But David eluded him twice."
"9303","1 Samuel","18","12","Saul was afraid of David, because the Lord was with David but had departed from Saul. "
"9304","1 Samuel","18","13","So he sent David away from him and gave him command over a thousand men, and David led the troops in their campaigns. "
"9305","1 Samuel","18","14","In everything he did he had great success, because the Lord was with him. "
"9306","1 Samuel","18","15","When Saul saw how successful he was, he was afraid of him. "
"9307","1 Samuel","18","16","But all Israel and Judah loved David, because he led them in their campaigns."
"9308","1 Samuel","18","17","Saul said to David, “Here is my older daughter Merab. I will give her to you in marriage; only serve me bravely and fight the battles of the Lord.” For Saul said to himself, “I will not raise a hand against him. Let the Philistines do that!”"
"9309","1 Samuel","18","18","But David said to Saul, “Who am I, and what is my family or my clan in Israel, that I should become the king’s son-in-law?” "
"9310","1 Samuel","18","19","So18:19 Or However, when the time came for Merab, Saul’s daughter, to be given to David, she was given in marriage to Adriel of Meholah."
"9311","1 Samuel","18","20","Now Saul’s daughter Michal was in love with David, and when they told Saul about it, he was pleased.  "
"9312","1 Samuel","18","21","""I will give her to him,” he thought, “so that she may be a snare to him and so that the hand of the Philistines may be against him.” So Saul said to David, “Now you have a second opportunity to become my son-in-law.”"
"9313","1 Samuel","18","22","Then Saul ordered his attendants: “Speak to David privately and say, ‘Look, the king likes you, and his attendants all love you; now become his son-in-law.’ ”"
"9314","1 Samuel","18","23","They repeated these words to David. But David said, “Do you think it is a small matter to become the king’s son-in-law? I’m only a poor man and little known.”"
"9315","1 Samuel","18","24","When Saul’s servants told him what David had said, "
"9316","1 Samuel","18","25","Saul replied, “Say to David, ‘The king wants no other price for the bride than a hundred Philistine foreskins, to take revenge on his enemies.’ ” Saul’s plan was to have David fall by the hands of the Philistines."
"9317","1 Samuel","18","26","When the attendants told David these things, he was pleased to become the king’s son-in-law. So before the allotted time elapsed, "
"9318","1 Samuel","18","27","David took his men with him and went out and killed two hundred Philistines and brought back their foreskins. They counted out the full number to the king so that David might become the king’s son-in-law. Then Saul gave him his daughter Michal in marriage."
"9319","1 Samuel","18","28","When Saul realized that the Lord was with David and that his daughter Michal loved David, "
"9320","1 Samuel","18","29","Saul became still more afraid of him, and he remained his enemy the rest of his days."
"9321","1 Samuel","18","30","The Philistine commanders continued to go out to battle, and as often as they did, David met with more success than the rest of Saul’s officers, and his name became well known."
"9322","1 Samuel","19","1","Saul told his son Jonathan and all the attendants to kill David. But Jonathan had taken a great liking to David "
"9323","1 Samuel","19","2","and warned him, “My father Saul is looking for a chance to kill you. Be on your guard tomorrow morning; go into hiding and stay there. "
"9324","1 Samuel","19","3","I will go out and stand with my father in the field where you are. I’ll speak to him about you and will tell you what I find out.”"
"9325","1 Samuel","19","4","Jonathan spoke well of David to Saul his father and said to him, “Let not the king do wrong to his servant David; he has not wronged you, and what he has done has benefited you greatly. "
"9326","1 Samuel","19","5","He took his life in his hands when he killed the Philistine. The Lord won a great victory for all Israel, and you saw it and were glad. Why then would you do wrong to an innocent man like David by killing him for no reason?”"
"9327","1 Samuel","19","6","Saul listened to Jonathan and took this oath: “As surely as the Lord lives, David will not be put to death.”"
"9328","1 Samuel","19","7","So Jonathan called David and told him the whole conversation. He brought him to Saul, and David was with Saul as before."
"9329","1 Samuel","19","8","Once more war broke out, and David went out and fought the Philistines. He struck them with such force that they fled before him."
"9330","1 Samuel","19","9","But an evil19:9 Or But a harmful spirit from the Lord came on Saul as he was sitting in his house with his spear in his hand. While David was playing the lyre, "
"9331","1 Samuel","19","10","Saul tried to pin him to the wall with his spear, but David eluded him as Saul drove the spear into the wall. That night David made good his escape."
"9332","1 Samuel","19","11","Saul sent men to David’s house to watch it and to kill him in the morning. But Michal, David’s wife, warned him, “If you don’t run for your life tonight, tomorrow you’ll be killed.” "
"9333","1 Samuel","19","12","So Michal let David down through a window, and he fled and escaped. "
"9334","1 Samuel","19","13","Then Michal took an idol and laid it on the bed, covering it with a garment and putting some goats’ hair at the head."
"9335","1 Samuel","19","14","When Saul sent the men to capture David, Michal said, “He is ill.”"
"9336","1 Samuel","19","15","Then Saul sent the men back to see David and told them, “Bring him up to me in his bed so that I may kill him.” "
"9337","1 Samuel","19","16","But when the men entered, there was the idol in the bed, and at the head was some goats’ hair."
"9338","1 Samuel","19","17","Saul said to Michal, “Why did you deceive me like this and send my enemy away so that he escaped?”Michal told him, “He said to me, ‘Let me get away. Why should I kill you?’ ”"
"9339","1 Samuel","19","18","When David had fled and made his escape, he went to Samuel at Ramah and told him all that Saul had done to him. Then he and Samuel went to Naioth and stayed there. "
"9340","1 Samuel","19","19","Word came to Saul: “David is in Naioth at Ramah”; "
"9341","1 Samuel","19","20","so he sent men to capture him. But when they saw a group of prophets prophesying, with Samuel standing there as their leader, the Spirit of God came on Saul’s men, and they also prophesied. "
"9342","1 Samuel","19","21","Saul was told about it, and he sent more men, and they prophesied too. Saul sent men a third time, and they also prophesied. "
"9343","1 Samuel","19","22","Finally, he himself left for Ramah and went to the great cistern at Seku. And he asked, “Where are Samuel and David?”“Over in Naioth at Ramah,” they said."
"9344","1 Samuel","19","23","So Saul went to Naioth at Ramah. But the Spirit of God came even on him, and he walked along prophesying until he came to Naioth. "
"9345","1 Samuel","19","24","He stripped off his garments, and he too prophesied in Samuel’s presence. He lay naked all that day and all that night. This is why people say, “Is Saul also among the prophets?”"
"9346","1 Samuel","20","1","Then David fled from Naioth at Ramah and went to Jonathan and asked, “What have I done? What is my crime? How have I wronged your father, that he is trying to kill me?” "
"9347","1 Samuel","20","2","""Never!” Jonathan replied. “You are not going to die! Look, my father doesn’t do anything, great or small, without letting me know. Why would he hide this from me? It isn’t so!”"
"9348","1 Samuel","20","3","But David took an oath and said, “Your father knows very well that I have found favor in your eyes, and he has said to himself, ‘Jonathan must not know this or he will be grieved.’ Yet as surely as the Lord lives and as you live, there is only a step between me and death.”"
"9349","1 Samuel","20","4","Jonathan said to David, “Whatever you want me to do, I’ll do for you.”"
"9350","1 Samuel","20","5","So David said, “Look, tomorrow is the New Moon feast, and I am supposed to dine with the king; but let me go and hide in the field until the evening of the day after tomorrow. "
"9351","1 Samuel","20","6","If your father misses me at all, tell him, ‘David earnestly asked my permission to hurry to Bethlehem, his hometown, because an annual sacrifice is being made there for his whole clan.’ "
"9352","1 Samuel","20","7","If he says, ‘Very well,’ then your servant is safe. But if he loses his temper, you can be sure that he is determined to harm me. "
"9353","1 Samuel","20","8","As for you, show kindness to your servant, for you have brought him into a covenant with you before the Lord. If I am guilty, then kill me yourself! Why hand me over to your father?” "
"9354","1 Samuel","20","9","""Never!” Jonathan said. “If I had the least inkling that my father was determined to harm you, wouldn’t I tell you?”"
"9355","1 Samuel","20","10","David asked, “Who will tell me if your father answers you harshly?” "
"9356","1 Samuel","20","11","""Come,” Jonathan said, “let’s go out into the field.” So they went there together."
"9357","1 Samuel","20","12","Then Jonathan said to David, “I swear by the Lord, the God of Israel, that I will surely sound out my father by this time the day after tomorrow! If he is favorably disposed toward you, will I not send you word and let you know? "
"9358","1 Samuel","20","13","But if my father intends to harm you, may the Lord deal with Jonathan, be it ever so severely, if I do not let you know and send you away in peace. May the Lord be with you as he has been with my father. "
"9359","1 Samuel","20","14","But show me unfailing kindness like the Lord’s kindness as long as I live, so that I may not be killed, "
"9360","1 Samuel","20","15","and do not ever cut off your kindness from my family—not even when the Lord has cut off every one of David’s enemies from the face of the earth.”"
"9361","1 Samuel","20","16","So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, “May the Lord call David’s enemies to account.” "
"9362","1 Samuel","20","17","And Jonathan had David reaffirm his oath out of love for him, because he loved him as he loved himself."
"9363","1 Samuel","20","18","Then Jonathan said to David, “Tomorrow is the New Moon feast. You will be missed, because your seat will be empty. "
"9364","1 Samuel","20","19","The day after tomorrow, toward evening, go to the place where you hid when this trouble began, and wait by the stone Ezel. "
"9365","1 Samuel","20","20","I will shoot three arrows to the side of it, as though I were shooting at a target. "
"9366","1 Samuel","20","21","Then I will send a boy and say, ‘Go, find the arrows.’ If I say to him, ‘Look, the arrows are on this side of you; bring them here,’ then come, because, as surely as the Lord lives, you are safe; there is no danger. "
"9367","1 Samuel","20","22","But if I say to the boy, ‘Look, the arrows are beyond you,’ then you must go, because the Lord has sent you away. "
"9368","1 Samuel","20","23","And about the matter you and I discussed—remember, the Lord is witness between you and me forever.”"
"9369","1 Samuel","20","24","So David hid in the field, and when the New Moon feast came, the king sat down to eat. "
"9370","1 Samuel","20","25","He sat in his customary place by the wall, opposite Jonathan,20:25 Septuagint; Hebrew wall. Jonathan arose and Abner sat next to Saul, but David’s place was empty. "
"9371","1 Samuel","20","26","Saul said nothing that day, for he thought, “Something must have happened to David to make him ceremonially unclean—surely he is unclean.” "
"9372","1 Samuel","20","27","But the next day, the second day of the month, David’s place was empty again. Then Saul said to his son Jonathan, “Why hasn’t the son of Jesse come to the meal, either yesterday or today?”"
"9373","1 Samuel","20","28","Jonathan answered, “David earnestly asked me for permission to go to Bethlehem. "
"9374","1 Samuel","20","29","He said, ‘Let me go, because our family is observing a sacrifice in the town and my brother has ordered me to be there. If I have found favor in your eyes, let me get away to see my brothers.’ That is why he has not come to the king’s table.”"
"9375","1 Samuel","20","30","Saul’s anger flared up at Jonathan and he said to him, “You son of a perverse and rebellious woman! Don’t I know that you have sided with the son of Jesse to your own shame and to the shame of the mother who bore you? "
"9376","1 Samuel","20","31","As long as the son of Jesse lives on this earth, neither you nor your kingdom will be established. Now send someone to bring him to me, for he must die!” "
"9377","1 Samuel","20","32","""Why should he be put to death? What has he done?” Jonathan asked his father. "
"9378","1 Samuel","20","33","But Saul hurled his spear at him to kill him. Then Jonathan knew that his father intended to kill David."
"9379","1 Samuel","20","34","Jonathan got up from the table in fierce anger; on that second day of the feast he did not eat, because he was grieved at his father’s shameful treatment of David."
"9380","1 Samuel","20","35","In the morning Jonathan went out to the field for his meeting with David. He had a small boy with him, "
"9381","1 Samuel","20","36","and he said to the boy, “Run and find the arrows I shoot.” As the boy ran, he shot an arrow beyond him. "
"9382","1 Samuel","20","37","When the boy came to the place where Jonathan’s arrow had fallen, Jonathan called out after him, “Isn’t the arrow beyond you?” "
"9383","1 Samuel","20","38","Then he shouted, “Hurry! Go quickly! Don’t stop!” The boy picked up the arrow and returned to his master. 39(The boy knew nothing about all this; only Jonathan and David knew.) "
"9384","1 Samuel","20","40","Then Jonathan gave his weapons to the boy and said, “Go, carry them back to town.”"
"9385","1 Samuel","20","41","After the boy had gone, David got up from the south side of the stone and bowed down before Jonathan three times, with his face to the ground. Then they kissed each other and wept together—but David wept the most."
"9386","1 Samuel","20","42","Jonathan said to David, “Go in peace, for we have sworn friendship with each other in the name of the Lord, saying, ‘The Lord is witness between you and me, and between your descendants and my descendants forever.’ ” Then David left, and Jonathan went back to the town.20:42 In Hebrew texts this sentence (20:"
"9387","1 Samuel","20","42","b) is numbered 21:1."
"9388","1 Samuel","21","1","David went to Nob, to Ahimelek the priest. Ahimelek trembled when he met him, and asked, “Why are you alone? Why is no one with you?”"
"9389","1 Samuel","21","2","David answered Ahimelek the priest, “The king sent me on a mission and said to me, ‘No one is to know anything about the mission I am sending you on.’ As for my men, I have told them to meet me at a certain place. "
"9390","1 Samuel","21","3","Now then, what do you have on hand? Give me five loaves of bread, or whatever you can find.”"
"9391","1 Samuel","21","4","But the priest answered David, “I don’t have any ordinary bread on hand; however, there is some consecrated bread here—provided the men have kept themselves from women.”"
"9392","1 Samuel","21","5","David replied, “Indeed women have been kept from us, as usual whenever21:5 Or from us in the past few days since I set out. The men’s bodies are holy even on missions that are not holy. How much more so today!” "
"9393","1 Samuel","21","6","So the priest gave him the consecrated bread, since there was no bread there except the bread of the Presence that had been removed from before the Lord and replaced by hot bread on the day it was taken away."
"9394","1 Samuel","21","7","Now one of Saul’s servants was there that day, detained before the Lord; he was Doeg the Edomite, Saul’s chief shepherd."
"9395","1 Samuel","21","8","David asked Ahimelek, “Don’t you have a spear or a sword here? I haven’t brought my sword or any other weapon, because the king’s mission was urgent.”"
"9396","1 Samuel","21","9","The priest replied, “The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you killed in the Valley of Elah, is here; it is wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod. If you want it, take it; there is no sword here but that one.”David said, “There is none like it; give it to me.”David at Gath"
"9397","1 Samuel","21","10","That day David fled from Saul and went to Achish king of Gath. "
"9398","1 Samuel","21","11","But the servants of Achish said to him, “Isn’t this David, the king of the land? Isn’t he the one they sing about in their dances:“ ‘Saul has slain his thousands,and David his tens of thousands’?”"
"9399","1 Samuel","21","12","David took these words to heart and was very much afraid of Achish king of Gath. "
"9400","1 Samuel","21","13","So he pretended to be insane in their presence; and while he was in their hands he acted like a madman, making marks on the doors of the gate and letting saliva run down his beard."
"9401","1 Samuel","21","14","Achish said to his servants, “Look at the man! He is insane! Why bring him to me? "
"9402","1 Samuel","21","15","Am I so short of madmen that you have to bring this fellow here to carry on like this in front of me? Must this man come into my house?”"
"9403","1 Samuel","22","1","David left Gath and escaped to the cave of Adullam. When his brothers and his father’s household heard about it, they went down to him there. "
"9404","1 Samuel","22","2","All those who were in distress or in debt or discontented gathered around him, and he became their commander. About four hundred men were with him."
"9405","1 Samuel","22","3","From there David went to Mizpah in Moab and said to the king of Moab, “Would you let my father and mother come and stay with you until I learn what God will do for me?” "
"9406","1 Samuel","22","4","So he left them with the king of Moab, and they stayed with him as long as David was in the stronghold."
"9407","1 Samuel","22","5","But the prophet Gad said to David, “Do not stay in the stronghold. Go into the land of Judah.” So David left and went to the forest of Hereth.Saul Kills the Priests of Nob"
"9408","1 Samuel","22","6","Now Saul heard that David and his men had been discovered. And Saul was seated, spear in hand, under the tamarisk tree on the hill at Gibeah, with all his officials standing at his side. "
"9409","1 Samuel","22","7","He said to them, “Listen, men of Benjamin! Will the son of Jesse give all of you fields and vineyards? Will he make all of you commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds? "
"9410","1 Samuel","22","8","Is that why you have all conspired against me? No one tells me when my son makes a covenant with the son of Jesse. None of you is concerned about me or tells me that my son has incited my servant to lie in wait for me, as he does today.”"
"9411","1 Samuel","22","9","But Doeg the Edomite, who was standing with Saul’s officials, said, “I saw the son of Jesse come to Ahimelek son of Ahitub at Nob. "
"9412","1 Samuel","22","10","Ahimelek inquired of the Lord for him; he also gave him provisions and the sword of Goliath the Philistine.”"
"9413","1 Samuel","22","11","Then the king sent for the priest Ahimelek son of Ahitub and all the men of his family, who were the priests at Nob, and they all came to the king. "
"9414","1 Samuel","22","12","Saul said, “Listen now, son of Ahitub.”“Yes, my lord,” he answered."
"9415","1 Samuel","22","13","Saul said to him, “Why have you conspired against me, you and the son of Jesse, giving him bread and a sword and inquiring of God for him, so that he has rebelled against me and lies in wait for me, as he does today?”"
"9416","1 Samuel","22","14","Ahimelek answered the king, “Who of all your servants is as loyal as David, the king’s son-in-law, captain of your bodyguard and highly respected in your household? "
"9417","1 Samuel","22","15","Was that day the first time I inquired of God for him? Of course not! Let not the king accuse your servant or any of his father’s family, for your servant knows nothing at all about this whole affair.”"
"9418","1 Samuel","22","16","But the king said, “You will surely die, Ahimelek, you and your whole family.”"
"9419","1 Samuel","22","17","Then the king ordered the guards at his side: “Turn and kill the priests of the Lord, because they too have sided with David. They knew he was fleeing, yet they did not tell me.”But the king’s officials were unwilling to raise a hand to strike the priests of the Lord."
"9420","1 Samuel","22","18","The king then ordered Doeg, “You turn and strike down the priests.” So Doeg the Edomite turned and struck them down. That day he killed eighty-five men who wore the linen ephod. "
"9421","1 Samuel","22","19","He also put to the sword Nob, the town of the priests, with its men and women, its children and infants, and its cattle, donkeys and sheep."
"9422","1 Samuel","22","20","But one son of Ahimelek son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped and fled to join David. "
"9423","1 Samuel","22","21","He told David that Saul had killed the priests of the Lord. "
"9424","1 Samuel","22","22","Then David said to Abiathar, “That day, when Doeg the Edomite was there, I knew he would be sure to tell Saul. I am responsible for the death of your whole family. "
"9425","1 Samuel","22","23","Stay with me; don’t be afraid. The man who wants to kill you is trying to kill me too. You will be safe with me.”"
"9426","1 Samuel","23","1","When David was told, “Look, the Philistines are fighting against Keilah and are looting the threshing floors,” "
"9427","1 Samuel","23","2","he inquired of the Lord, saying, “Shall I go and attack these Philistines?”The Lord answered him, “Go, attack the Philistines and save Keilah.”"
"9428","1 Samuel","23","3","But David’s men said to him, “Here in Judah we are afraid. How much more, then, if we go to Keilah against the Philistine forces!”"
"9429","1 Samuel","23","4","Once again David inquired of the Lord, and the Lord answered him, “Go down to Keilah, for I am going to give the Philistines into your hand.” "
"9430","1 Samuel","23","5","So David and his men went to Keilah, fought the Philistines and carried off their livestock. He inflicted heavy losses on the Philistines and saved the people of Keilah. 6(Now Abiathar son of Ahimelek had brought the ephod down with him when he fled to David at Keilah.)Saul Pursues David"
"9431","1 Samuel","23","7","Saul was told that David had gone to Keilah, and he said, “God has delivered him into my hands, for David has imprisoned himself by entering a town with gates and bars.” "
"9432","1 Samuel","23","8","And Saul called up all his forces for battle, to go down to Keilah to besiege David and his men."
"9433","1 Samuel","23","9","When David learned that Saul was plotting against him, he said to Abiathar the priest, “Bring the ephod.” "
"9434","1 Samuel","23","10","David said, “Lord, God of Israel, your servant has heard definitely that Saul plans to come to Keilah and destroy the town on account of me. "
"9435","1 Samuel","23","11","Will the citizens of Keilah surrender me to him? Will Saul come down, as your servant has heard? Lord, God of Israel, tell your servant.”And the Lord said, “He will.”"
"9436","1 Samuel","23","12","Again David asked, “Will the citizens of Keilah surrender me and my men to Saul?”And the Lord said, “They will.”"
"9437","1 Samuel","23","13","So David and his men, about six hundred in number, left Keilah and kept moving from place to place. When Saul was told that David had escaped from Keilah, he did not go there."
"9438","1 Samuel","23","14","David stayed in the wilderness strongholds and in the hills of the Desert of Ziph. Day after day Saul searched for him, but God did not give David into his hands."
"9439","1 Samuel","23","15","While David was at Horesh in the Desert of Ziph, he learned that23:15 Or he was afraid because Saul had come out to take his life. "
"9440","1 Samuel","23","16","And Saul’s son Jonathan went to David at Horesh and helped him find strength in God.  "
"9441","1 Samuel","23","17","""Don’t be afraid,” he said. “My father Saul will not lay a hand on you. You will be king over Israel, and I will be second to you. Even my father Saul knows this.” "
"9442","1 Samuel","23","18","The two of them made a covenant before the Lord. Then Jonathan went home, but David remained at Horesh."
"9443","1 Samuel","23","19","The Ziphites went up to Saul at Gibeah and said, “Is not David hiding among us in the strongholds at Horesh, on the hill of Hakilah, south of Jeshimon? "
"9444","1 Samuel","23","20","Now, Your Majesty, come down whenever it pleases you to do so, and we will be responsible for giving him into your hands.”"
"9445","1 Samuel","23","21","Saul replied, “The Lord bless you for your concern for me. "
"9446","1 Samuel","23","22","Go and get more information. Find out where David usually goes and who has seen him there. They tell me he is very crafty. "
"9447","1 Samuel","23","23","Find out about all the hiding places he uses and come back to me with definite information. Then I will go with you; if he is in the area, I will track him down among all the clans of Judah.”"
"9448","1 Samuel","23","24","So they set out and went to Ziph ahead of Saul. Now David and his men were in the Desert of Maon, in the Arabah south of Jeshimon. "
"9449","1 Samuel","23","25","Saul and his men began the search, and when David was told about it, he went down to the rock and stayed in the Desert of Maon. When Saul heard this, he went into the Desert of Maon in pursuit of David."
"9450","1 Samuel","23","26","Saul was going along one side of the mountain, and David and his men were on the other side, hurrying to get away from Saul. As Saul and his forces were closing in on David and his men to capture them, "
"9451","1 Samuel","23","27","a messenger came to Saul, saying, “Come quickly! The Philistines are raiding the land.” "
"9452","1 Samuel","23","28","Then Saul broke off his pursuit of David and went to meet the Philistines. That is why they call this place Sela Hammahlekoth.23:28 Sela Hammahlekoth means rock of parting. "
"9453","1 Samuel","23","29","And David went up from there and lived in the strongholds of En Gedi.23:29 In Hebrew texts this verse (23:29) is numbered 24:1."
"9454","1 Samuel","24","1","After Saul returned from pursuing the Philistines, he was told, “David is in the Desert of En Gedi.” "
"9455","1 Samuel","24","2","So Saul took three thousand able young men from all Israel and set out to look for David and his men near the Crags of the Wild Goats."
"9456","1 Samuel","24","3","He came to the sheep pens along the way; a cave was there, and Saul went in to relieve himself. David and his men were far back in the cave. "
"9457","1 Samuel","24","4","The men said, “This is the day the Lord spoke of when he said24:4 Or “Today the Lord is saying to you, ‘I will give your enemy into your hands for you to deal with as you wish.’ ” Then David crept up unnoticed and cut off a corner of Saul’s robe."
"9458","1 Samuel","24","5","Afterward, David was conscience-stricken for having cut off a corner of his robe. "
"9459","1 Samuel","24","6","He said to his men, “The Lord forbid that I should do such a thing to my master, the Lord’s anointed, or lay my hand on him; for he is the anointed of the Lord.” "
"9460","1 Samuel","24","7","With these words David sharply rebuked his men and did not allow them to attack Saul. And Saul left the cave and went his way."
"9461","1 Samuel","24","8","Then David went out of the cave and called out to Saul, “My lord the king!” When Saul looked behind him, David bowed down and prostrated himself with his face to the ground. "
"9462","1 Samuel","24","9","He said to Saul, “Why do you listen when men say, ‘David is bent on harming you’? "
"9463","1 Samuel","24","10","This day you have seen with your own eyes how the Lord delivered you into my hands in the cave. Some urged me to kill you, but I spared you; I said, ‘I will not lay my hand on my lord, because he is the Lord’s anointed.’ "
"9464","1 Samuel","24","11","See, my father, look at this piece of your robe in my hand! I cut off the corner of your robe but did not kill you. See that there is nothing in my hand to indicate that I am guilty of wrongdoing or rebellion. I have not wronged you, but you are hunting me down to take my life. "
"9465","1 Samuel","24","12","May the Lord judge between you and me. And may the Lord avenge the wrongs you have done to me, but my hand will not touch you. "
"9466","1 Samuel","24","13","As the old saying goes, ‘From evildoers come evil deeds,’ so my hand will not touch you. "
"9467","1 Samuel","24","14","""Against whom has the king of Israel come out? Who are you pursuing? A dead dog? A flea? "
"9468","1 Samuel","24","15","May the Lord be our judge and decide between us. May he consider my cause and uphold it; may he vindicate me by delivering me from your hand.”"
"9469","1 Samuel","24","16","When David finished saying this, Saul asked, “Is that your voice, David my son?” And he wept aloud.  "
"9470","1 Samuel","24","17","""You are more righteous than I,” he said. “You have treated me well, but I have treated you badly. "
"9471","1 Samuel","24","18","You have just now told me about the good you did to me; the Lord delivered me into your hands, but you did not kill me. "
"9472","1 Samuel","24","19","When a man finds his enemy, does he let him get away unharmed? May the Lord reward you well for the way you treated me today. "
"9473","1 Samuel","24","20","I know that you will surely be king and that the kingdom of Israel will be established in your hands. "
"9474","1 Samuel","24","21","Now swear to me by the Lord that you will not kill off my descendants or wipe out my name from my father’s family.”"
"9475","1 Samuel","24","22","So David gave his oath to Saul. Then Saul returned home, but David and his men went up to the stronghold."
"9476","1 Samuel","25","1","Now Samuel died, and all Israel assembled and mourned for him; and they buried him at his home in Ramah. Then David moved down into the Desert of Paran.25:1 Hebrew and some Septuagint manuscripts; other Septuagint manuscripts Maon"
"9477","1 Samuel","25","2","A certain man in Maon, who had property there at Carmel, was very wealthy. He had a thousand goats and three thousand sheep, which he was shearing in Carmel. "
"9478","1 Samuel","25","3","His name was Nabal and his wife’s name was Abigail. She was an intelligent and beautiful woman, but her husband was surly and mean in his dealings—he was a Calebite."
"9479","1 Samuel","25","4","While David was in the wilderness, he heard that Nabal was shearing sheep. "
"9480","1 Samuel","25","5","So he sent ten young men and said to them, “Go up to Nabal at Carmel and greet him in my name. "
"9481","1 Samuel","25","6","Say to him: ‘Long life to you! Good health to you and your household! And good health to all that is yours! "
"9482","1 Samuel","25","7",""" ‘Now I hear that it is sheep-shearing time. When your shepherds were with us, we did not mistreat them, and the whole time they were at Carmel nothing of theirs was missing. "
"9483","1 Samuel","25","8","Ask your own servants and they will tell you. Therefore be favorable toward my men, since we come at a festive time. Please give your servants and your son David whatever you can find for them.’ ”"
"9484","1 Samuel","25","9","When David’s men arrived, they gave Nabal this message in David’s name. Then they waited."
"9485","1 Samuel","25","10","Nabal answered David’s servants, “Who is this David? Who is this son of Jesse? Many servants are breaking away from their masters these days. "
"9486","1 Samuel","25","11","Why should I take my bread and water, and the meat I have slaughtered for my shearers, and give it to men coming from who knows where?”"
"9487","1 Samuel","25","12","David’s men turned around and went back. When they arrived, they reported every word. "
"9488","1 Samuel","25","13","David said to his men, “Each of you strap on your sword!” So they did, and David strapped his on as well. About four hundred men went up with David, while two hundred stayed with the supplies."
"9489","1 Samuel","25","14","One of the servants told Abigail, Nabal’s wife, “David sent messengers from the wilderness to give our master his greetings, but he hurled insults at them. "
"9490","1 Samuel","25","15","Yet these men were very good to us. They did not mistreat us, and the whole time we were out in the fields near them nothing was missing. "
"9491","1 Samuel","25","16","Night and day they were a wall around us the whole time we were herding our sheep near them. "
"9492","1 Samuel","25","17","Now think it over and see what you can do, because disaster is hanging over our master and his whole household. He is such a wicked man that no one can talk to him.”"
"9493","1 Samuel","25","18","Abigail acted quickly. She took two hundred loaves of bread, two skins of wine, five dressed sheep, five seahs25:18 That is, probably about 60 pounds or about 27 kilograms of roasted grain, a hundred cakes of raisins and two hundred cakes of pressed figs, and loaded them on donkeys. "
"9494","1 Samuel","25","19","Then she told her servants, “Go on ahead; I’ll follow you.” But she did not tell her husband Nabal."
"9495","1 Samuel","25","20","As she came riding her donkey into a mountain ravine, there were David and his men descending toward her, and she met them. "
"9496","1 Samuel","25","21","David had just said, “It’s been useless—all my watching over this fellow’s property in the wilderness so that nothing of his was missing. He has paid me back evil for good. "
"9497","1 Samuel","25","22","May God deal with David,25:22 Some Septuagint manuscripts; Hebrew with David’s enemies be it ever so severely, if by morning I leave alive one male of all who belong to him!”"
"9498","1 Samuel","25","23","When Abigail saw David, she quickly got off her donkey and bowed down before David with her face to the ground. "
"9499","1 Samuel","25","24","She fell at his feet and said: “Pardon your servant, my lord, and let me speak to you; hear what your servant has to say. "
"9500","1 Samuel","25","25","Please pay no attention, my lord, to that wicked man Nabal. He is just like his name—his name means Fool, and folly goes with him. And as for me, your servant, I did not see the men my lord sent. "
"9501","1 Samuel","25","26","And now, my lord, as surely as the Lord your God lives and as you live, since the Lord has kept you from bloodshed and from avenging yourself with your own hands, may your enemies and all who are intent on harming my lord be like Nabal. "
"9502","1 Samuel","25","27","And let this gift, which your servant has brought to my lord, be given to the men who follow you. "
"9503","1 Samuel","25","28","""Please forgive your servant’s presumption. The Lord your God will certainly make a lasting dynasty for my lord, because you fight the Lord’s battles, and no wrongdoing will be found in you as long as you live. "
"9504","1 Samuel","25","29","Even though someone is pursuing you to take your life, the life of my lord will be bound securely in the bundle of the living by the Lord your God, but the lives of your enemies he will hurl away as from the pocket of a sling. "
"9505","1 Samuel","25","30","When the Lord has fulfilled for my lord every good thing he promised concerning him and has appointed him ruler over Israel, "
"9506","1 Samuel","25","31","my lord will not have on his conscience the staggering burden of needless bloodshed or of having avenged himself. And when the Lord your God has brought my lord success, remember your servant.”"
"9507","1 Samuel","25","32","David said to Abigail, “Praise be to the Lord, the God of Israel, who has sent you today to meet me. "
"9508","1 Samuel","25","33","May you be blessed for your good judgment and for keeping me from bloodshed this day and from avenging myself with my own hands. "
"9509","1 Samuel","25","34","Otherwise, as surely as the Lord, the God of Israel, lives, who has kept me from harming you, if you had not come quickly to meet me, not one male belonging to Nabal would have been left alive by daybreak.”"
"9510","1 Samuel","25","35","Then David accepted from her hand what she had brought him and said, “Go home in peace. I have heard your words and granted your request.”"
"9511","1 Samuel","25","36","When Abigail went to Nabal, he was in the house holding a banquet like that of a king. He was in high spirits and very drunk. So she told him nothing at all until daybreak. "
"9512","1 Samuel","25","37","Then in the morning, when Nabal was sober, his wife told him all these things, and his heart failed him and he became like a stone. "
"9513","1 Samuel","25","38","About ten days later, the Lord struck Nabal and he died."
"9514","1 Samuel","25","39","When David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, “Praise be to the Lord, who has upheld my cause against Nabal for treating me with contempt. He has kept his servant from doing wrong and has brought Nabal’s wrongdoing down on his own head.”Then David sent word to Abigail, asking her to become his wife. "
"9515","1 Samuel","25","40","His servants went to Carmel and said to Abigail, “David has sent us to you to take you to become his wife.”"
"9516","1 Samuel","25","41","She bowed down with her face to the ground and said, “I am your servant and am ready to serve you and wash the feet of my lord’s servants.” "
"9517","1 Samuel","25","42","Abigail quickly got on a donkey and, attended by her five female servants, went with David’s messengers and became his wife. "
"9518","1 Samuel","25","43","David had also married Ahinoam of Jezreel, and they both were his wives. "
"9519","1 Samuel","25","44","But Saul had given his daughter Michal, David’s wife, to Paltiel25:44 Hebrew Palti, a variant of Paltiel son of Laish, who was from Gallim."
"9520","1 Samuel","26","1","The Ziphites went to Saul at Gibeah and said, “Is not David hiding on the hill of Hakilah, which faces Jeshimon?”"
"9521","1 Samuel","26","2","So Saul went down to the Desert of Ziph, with his three thousand select Israelite troops, to search there for David. "
"9522","1 Samuel","26","3","Saul made his camp beside the road on the hill of Hakilah facing Jeshimon, but David stayed in the wilderness. When he saw that Saul had followed him there, "
"9523","1 Samuel","26","4","he sent out scouts and learned that Saul had definitely arrived."
"9524","1 Samuel","26","5","Then David set out and went to the place where Saul had camped. He saw where Saul and Abner son of Ner, the commander of the army, had lain down. Saul was lying inside the camp, with the army encamped around him."
"9525","1 Samuel","26","6","David then asked Ahimelek the Hittite and Abishai son of Zeruiah, Joab’s brother, “Who will go down into the camp with me to Saul?”“I’ll go with you,” said Abishai."
"9526","1 Samuel","26","7","So David and Abishai went to the army by night, and there was Saul, lying asleep inside the camp with his spear stuck in the ground near his head. Abner and the soldiers were lying around him."
"9527","1 Samuel","26","8","Abishai said to David, “Today God has delivered your enemy into your hands. Now let me pin him to the ground with one thrust of the spear; I won’t strike him twice.”"
"9528","1 Samuel","26","9","But David said to Abishai, “Don’t destroy him! Who can lay a hand on the Lord’s anointed and be guiltless? "
"9529","1 Samuel","26","10","As surely as the Lord lives,” he said, “the Lord himself will strike him, or his time will come and he will die, or he will go into battle and perish. "
"9530","1 Samuel","26","11","But the Lord forbid that I should lay a hand on the Lord’s anointed. Now get the spear and water jug that are near his head, and let’s go.”"
"9531","1 Samuel","26","12","So David took the spear and water jug near Saul’s head, and they left. No one saw or knew about it, nor did anyone wake up. They were all sleeping, because the Lord had put them into a deep sleep."
"9532","1 Samuel","26","13","Then David crossed over to the other side and stood on top of the hill some distance away; there was a wide space between them. "
"9533","1 Samuel","26","14","He called out to the army and to Abner son of Ner, “Aren’t you going to answer me, Abner?”Abner replied, “Who are you who calls to the king?”"
"9534","1 Samuel","26","15","David said, “You’re a man, aren’t you? And who is like you in Israel? Why didn’t you guard your lord the king? Someone came to destroy your lord the king. "
"9535","1 Samuel","26","16","What you have done is not good. As surely as the Lord lives, you and your men must die, because you did not guard your master, the Lord’s anointed. Look around you. Where are the king’s spear and water jug that were near his head?”"
"9536","1 Samuel","26","17","Saul recognized David’s voice and said, “Is that your voice, David my son?”David replied, “Yes it is, my lord the king.” "
"9537","1 Samuel","26","18","And he added, “Why is my lord pursuing his servant? What have I done, and what wrong am I guilty of? "
"9538","1 Samuel","26","19","Now let my lord the king listen to his servant’s words. If the Lord has incited you against me, then may he accept an offering. If, however, people have done it, may they be cursed before the Lord! They have driven me today from my share in the Lord’s inheritance and have said, ‘Go, serve other gods.’ "
"9539","1 Samuel","26","20","Now do not let my blood fall to the ground far from the presence of the Lord. The king of Israel has come out to look for a flea—as one hunts a partridge in the mountains.”"
"9540","1 Samuel","26","21","Then Saul said, “I have sinned. Come back, David my son. Because you considered my life precious today, I will not try to harm you again. Surely I have acted like a fool and have been terribly wrong.” "
"9541","1 Samuel","26","22","""Here is the king’s spear,” David answered. “Let one of your young men come over and get it. "
"9542","1 Samuel","26","23","The Lord rewards everyone for their righteousness and faithfulness. The Lord delivered you into my hands today, but I would not lay a hand on the Lord’s anointed. "
"9543","1 Samuel","26","24","As surely as I valued your life today, so may the Lord value my life and deliver me from all trouble.”"
"9544","1 Samuel","26","25","Then Saul said to David, “May you be blessed, David my son; you will do great things and surely triumph.”So David went on his way, and Saul returned home."
"9545","1 Samuel","27","1","But David thought to himself, “One of these days I will be destroyed by the hand of Saul. The best thing I can do is to escape to the land of the Philistines. Then Saul will give up searching for me anywhere in Israel, and I will slip out of his hand.”"
"9546","1 Samuel","27","2","So David and the six hundred men with him left and went over to Achish son of Maok king of Gath. "
"9547","1 Samuel","27","3","David and his men settled in Gath with Achish. Each man had his family with him, and David had his two wives: Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail of Carmel, the widow of Nabal. "
"9548","1 Samuel","27","4","When Saul was told that David had fled to Gath, he no longer searched for him."
"9549","1 Samuel","27","5","Then David said to Achish, “If I have found favor in your eyes, let a place be assigned to me in one of the country towns, that I may live there. Why should your servant live in the royal city with you?”"
"9550","1 Samuel","27","6","So on that day Achish gave him Ziklag, and it has belonged to the kings of Judah ever since. "
"9551","1 Samuel","27","7","David lived in Philistine territory a year and four months."
"9552","1 Samuel","27","8","Now David and his men went up and raided the Geshurites, the Girzites and the Amalekites. (From ancient times these peoples had lived in the land extending to Shur and Egypt.) "
"9553","1 Samuel","27","9","Whenever David attacked an area, he did not leave a man or woman alive, but took sheep and cattle, donkeys and camels, and clothes. Then he returned to Achish."
"9554","1 Samuel","27","10","When Achish asked, “Where did you go raiding today?” David would say, “Against the Negev of Judah” or “Against the Negev of Jerahmeel” or “Against the Negev of the Kenites.” "
"9555","1 Samuel","27","11","He did not leave a man or woman alive to be brought to Gath, for he thought, “They might inform on us and say, ‘This is what David did.’ ” And such was his practice as long as he lived in Philistine territory. "
"9556","1 Samuel","27","12","Achish trusted David and said to himself, “He has become so obnoxious to his people, the Israelites, that he will be my servant for life.”"
"9557","1 Samuel","28","1","In those days the Philistines gathered their forces to fight against Israel. Achish said to David, “You must understand that you and your men will accompany me in the army.”"
"9558","1 Samuel","28","2","David said, “Then you will see for yourself what your servant can do.”Achish replied, “Very well, I will make you my bodyguard for life.”Saul and the Medium at Endor"
"9559","1 Samuel","28","3","Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had mourned for him and buried him in his own town of Ramah. Saul had expelled the mediums and spiritists from the land."
"9560","1 Samuel","28","4","The Philistines assembled and came and set up camp at Shunem, while Saul gathered all Israel and set up camp at Gilboa. "
"9561","1 Samuel","28","5","When Saul saw the Philistine army, he was afraid; terror filled his heart. "
"9562","1 Samuel","28","6","He inquired of the Lord, but the Lord did not answer him by dreams or Urim or prophets. "
"9563","1 Samuel","28","7","Saul then said to his attendants, “Find me a woman who is a medium, so I may go and inquire of her.”“There is one in Endor,” they said."
"9564","1 Samuel","28","8","So Saul disguised himself, putting on other clothes, and at night he and two men went to the woman. “Consult a spirit for me,” he said, “and bring up for me the one I name.”"
"9565","1 Samuel","28","9","But the woman said to him, “Surely you know what Saul has done. He has cut off the mediums and spiritists from the land. Why have you set a trap for my life to bring about my death?”"
"9566","1 Samuel","28","10","Saul swore to her by the Lord, “As surely as the Lord lives, you will not be punished for this.”"
"9567","1 Samuel","28","11","Then the woman asked, “Whom shall I bring up for you?”“Bring up Samuel,” he said."
"9568","1 Samuel","28","12","When the woman saw Samuel, she cried out at the top of her voice and said to Saul, “Why have you deceived me? You are Saul!”"
"9569","1 Samuel","28","13","The king said to her, “Don’t be afraid. What do you see?”The woman said, “I see a ghostly figure28:13 Or see spirits; or see gods coming up out of the earth.” "
"9570","1 Samuel","28","14","""What does he look like?” he asked.“An old man wearing a robe is coming up,” she said.Then Saul knew it was Samuel, and he bowed down and prostrated himself with his face to the ground."
"9571","1 Samuel","28","15","Samuel said to Saul, “Why have you disturbed me by bringing me up?”“I am in great distress,” Saul said. “The Philistines are fighting against me, and God has departed from me. He no longer answers me, either by prophets or by dreams. So I have called on you to tell me what to do.”"
"9572","1 Samuel","28","16","Samuel said, “Why do you consult me, now that the Lord has departed from you and become your enemy? "
"9573","1 Samuel","28","17","The Lord has done what he predicted through me. The Lord has torn the kingdom out of your hands and given it to one of your neighbors—to David. "
"9574","1 Samuel","28","18","Because you did not obey the Lord or carry out his fierce wrath against the Amalekites, the Lord has done this to you today. "
"9575","1 Samuel","28","19","The Lord will deliver both Israel and you into the hands of the Philistines, and tomorrow you and your sons will be with me. The Lord will also give the army of Israel into the hands of the Philistines.”"
"9576","1 Samuel","28","20","Immediately Saul fell full length on the ground, filled with fear because of Samuel’s words. His strength was gone, for he had eaten nothing all that day and all that night."
"9577","1 Samuel","28","21","When the woman came to Saul and saw that he was greatly shaken, she said, “Look, your servant has obeyed you. I took my life in my hands and did what you told me to do. "
"9578","1 Samuel","28","22","Now please listen to your servant and let me give you some food so you may eat and have the strength to go on your way.”"
"9579","1 Samuel","28","23","He refused and said, “I will not eat.”But his men joined the woman in urging him, and he listened to them. He got up from the ground and sat on the couch."
"9580","1 Samuel","28","24","The woman had a fattened calf at the house, which she butchered at once. She took some flour, kneaded it and baked bread without yeast. "
"9581","1 Samuel","28","25","Then she set it before Saul and his men, and they ate. That same night they got up and left."
"9582","1 Samuel","29","1","The Philistines gathered all their forces at Aphek, and Israel camped by the spring in Jezreel. "
"9583","1 Samuel","29","2","As the Philistine rulers marched with their units of hundreds and thousands, David and his men were marching at the rear with Achish. "
"9584","1 Samuel","29","3","The commanders of the Philistines asked, “What about these Hebrews?”Achish replied, “Is this not David, who was an officer of Saul king of Israel? He has already been with me for over a year, and from the day he left Saul until now, I have found no fault in him.”"
"9585","1 Samuel","29","4","But the Philistine commanders were angry with Achish and said, “Send the man back, that he may return to the place you assigned him. He must not go with us into battle, or he will turn against us during the fighting. How better could he regain his master’s favor than by taking the heads of our own men? "
"9586","1 Samuel","29","5","Isn’t this the David they sang about in their dances:“ ‘Saul has slain his thousands,and David his tens of thousands’?”"
"9587","1 Samuel","29","6","So Achish called David and said to him, “As surely as the Lord lives, you have been reliable, and I would be pleased to have you serve with me in the army. From the day you came to me until today, I have found no fault in you, but the rulers don’t approve of you. "
"9588","1 Samuel","29","7","Now turn back and go in peace; do nothing to displease the Philistine rulers.” "
"9589","1 Samuel","29","8","""But what have I done?” asked David. “What have you found against your servant from the day I came to you until now? Why can’t I go and fight against the enemies of my lord the king?”"
"9590","1 Samuel","29","9","Achish answered, “I know that you have been as pleasing in my eyes as an angel of God; nevertheless, the Philistine commanders have said, ‘He must not go up with us into battle.’ "
"9591","1 Samuel","29","10","Now get up early, along with your master’s servants who have come with you, and leave in the morning as soon as it is light.”"
"9592","1 Samuel","29","11","So David and his men got up early in the morning to go back to the land of the Philistines, and the Philistines went up to Jezreel."
"9593","1 Samuel","30","1","David and his men reached Ziklag on the third day. Now the Amalekites had raided the Negev and Ziklag. They had attacked Ziklag and burned it, "
"9594","1 Samuel","30","2","and had taken captive the women and everyone else in it, both young and old. They killed none of them, but carried them off as they went on their way."
"9595","1 Samuel","30","3","When David and his men reached Ziklag, they found it destroyed by fire and their wives and sons and daughters taken captive. "
"9596","1 Samuel","30","4","So David and his men wept aloud until they had no strength left to weep. "
"9597","1 Samuel","30","5","David’s two wives had been captured—Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail, the widow of Nabal of Carmel. "
"9598","1 Samuel","30","6","David was greatly distressed because the men were talking of stoning him; each one was bitter in spirit because of his sons and daughters. But David found strength in the Lord his God."
"9599","1 Samuel","30","7","Then David said to Abiathar the priest, the son of Ahimelek, “Bring me the ephod.” Abiathar brought it to him, "
"9600","1 Samuel","30","8","and David inquired of the Lord, “Shall I pursue this raiding party? Will I overtake them?”“Pursue them,” he answered. “You will certainly overtake them and succeed in the rescue.”"
"9601","1 Samuel","30","9","David and the six hundred men with him came to the Besor Valley, where some stayed behind. "
"9602","1 Samuel","30","10","Two hundred of them were too exhausted to cross the valley, but David and the other four hundred continued the pursuit."
"9603","1 Samuel","30","11","They found an Egyptian in a field and brought him to David. They gave him water to drink and food to eat— "
"9604","1 Samuel","30","12","part of a cake of pressed figs and two cakes of raisins. He ate and was revived, for he had not eaten any food or drunk any water for three days and three nights."
"9605","1 Samuel","30","13","David asked him, “Who do you belong to? Where do you come from?”He said, “I am an Egyptian, the slave of an Amalekite. My master abandoned me when I became ill three days ago. "
"9606","1 Samuel","30","14","We raided the Negev of the Kerethites, some territory belonging to Judah and the Negev of Caleb. And we burned Ziklag.”"
"9607","1 Samuel","30","15","David asked him, “Can you lead me down to this raiding party?”He answered, “Swear to me before God that you will not kill me or hand me over to my master, and I will take you down to them.”"
"9608","1 Samuel","30","16","He led David down, and there they were, scattered over the countryside, eating, drinking and reveling because of the great amount of plunder they had taken from the land of the Philistines and from Judah. "
"9609","1 Samuel","30","17","David fought them from dusk until the evening of the next day, and none of them got away, except four hundred young men who rode off on camels and fled. "
"9610","1 Samuel","30","18","David recovered everything the Amalekites had taken, including his two wives. "
"9611","1 Samuel","30","19","Nothing was missing: young or old, boy or girl, plunder or anything else they had taken. David brought everything back. "
"9612","1 Samuel","30","20","He took all the flocks and herds, and his men drove them ahead of the other livestock, saying, “This is David’s plunder.”"
"9613","1 Samuel","30","21","Then David came to the two hundred men who had been too exhausted to follow him and who were left behind at the Besor Valley. They came out to meet David and the men with him. As David and his men approached, he asked them how they were. "
"9614","1 Samuel","30","22","But all the evil men and troublemakers among David’s followers said, “Because they did not go out with us, we will not share with them the plunder we recovered. However, each man may take his wife and children and go.”"
"9615","1 Samuel","30","23","David replied, “No, my brothers, you must not do that with what the Lord has given us. He has protected us and delivered into our hands the raiding party that came against us. "
"9616","1 Samuel","30","24","Who will listen to what you say? The share of the man who stayed with the supplies is to be the same as that of him who went down to the battle. All will share alike.” "
"9617","1 Samuel","30","25","David made this a statute and ordinance for Israel from that day to this."
"9618","1 Samuel","30","26","When David reached Ziklag, he sent some of the plunder to the elders of Judah, who were his friends, saying, “Here is a gift for you from the plunder of the Lord’s enemies.”"
"9619","1 Samuel","30","27","David sent it to those who were in Bethel, Ramoth Negev and Jattir; "
"9620","1 Samuel","30","28","to those in Aroer, Siphmoth, Eshtemoa "
"9621","1 Samuel","30","29","and Rakal; to those in the towns of the Jerahmeelites and the Kenites; "
"9622","1 Samuel","30","30","to those in Hormah, Bor Ashan, Athak "
"9623","1 Samuel","30","31","and Hebron; and to those in all the other places where he and his men had roamed."
"9624","1 Samuel","31","1","Now the Philistines fought against Israel; the Israelites fled before them, and many fell dead on Mount Gilboa. "
"9625","1 Samuel","31","2","The Philistines were in hot pursuit of Saul and his sons, and they killed his sons Jonathan, Abinadab and Malki-Shua. "
"9626","1 Samuel","31","3","The fighting grew fierce around Saul, and when the archers overtook him, they wounded him critically."
"9627","1 Samuel","31","4","Saul said to his armor-bearer, “Draw your sword and run me through, or these uncircumcised fellows will come and run me through and abuse me.”But his armor-bearer was terrified and would not do it; so Saul took his own sword and fell on it. "
"9628","1 Samuel","31","5","When the armor-bearer saw that Saul was dead, he too fell on his sword and died with him. "
"9629","1 Samuel","31","6","So Saul and his three sons and his armor-bearer and all his men died together that same day."
"9630","1 Samuel","31","7","When the Israelites along the valley and those across the Jordan saw that the Israelite army had fled and that Saul and his sons had died, they abandoned their towns and fled. And the Philistines came and occupied them."
"9631","1 Samuel","31","8","The next day, when the Philistines came to strip the dead, they found Saul and his three sons fallen on Mount Gilboa. "
"9632","1 Samuel","31","9","They cut off his head and stripped off his armor, and they sent messengers throughout the land of the Philistines to proclaim the news in the temple of their idols and among their people. "
"9633","1 Samuel","31","10","They put his armor in the temple of the Ashtoreths and fastened his body to the wall of Beth Shan."
"9634","1 Samuel","31","11","When the people of Jabesh Gilead heard what the Philistines had done to Saul, "
"9635","1 Samuel","31","12","all their valiant men marched through the night to Beth Shan. They took down the bodies of Saul and his sons from the wall of Beth Shan and went to Jabesh, where they burned them. "
"9636","1 Samuel","31","13","Then they took their bones and buried them under a tamarisk tree at Jabesh, and they fasted seven days."
"9637","2 Samuel","1","1","After the death of Saul, David returned from striking down the Amalekites and stayed in Ziklag two days. "
"9638","2 Samuel","1","2","On the third day a man arrived from Saul’s camp with his clothes torn and dust on his head. When he came to David, he fell to the ground to pay him honor. "
"9639","2 Samuel","1","3","""Where have you come from?” David asked him.He answered, “I have escaped from the Israelite camp.” "
"9640","2 Samuel","1","4","""What happened?” David asked. “Tell me.”“The men fled from the battle,” he replied. “Many of them fell and died. And Saul and his son Jonathan are dead.”"
"9641","2 Samuel","1","5","Then David said to the young man who brought him the report, “How do you know that Saul and his son Jonathan are dead?” "
"9642","2 Samuel","1","6","""I happened to be on Mount Gilboa,” the young man said, “and there was Saul, leaning on his spear, with the chariots and their drivers in hot pursuit. "
"9643","2 Samuel","1","7","When he turned around and saw me, he called out to me, and I said, ‘What can I do?’ "
"9644","2 Samuel","1","8","""He asked me, ‘Who are you?’“ ‘An Amalekite,’ I answered. "
"9645","2 Samuel","1","9","""Then he said to me, ‘Stand here by me and kill me! I’m in the throes of death, but I’m still alive.’ "
"9646","2 Samuel","1","10","""So I stood beside him and killed him, because I knew that after he had fallen he could not survive. And I took the crown that was on his head and the band on his arm and have brought them here to my lord.”"
"9647","2 Samuel","1","11","Then David and all the men with him took hold of their clothes and tore them. "
"9648","2 Samuel","1","12","They mourned and wept and fasted till evening for Saul and his son Jonathan, and for the army of the Lord and for the nation of Israel, because they had fallen by the sword."
"9649","2 Samuel","1","13","David said to the young man who brought him the report, “Where are you from?”“I am the son of a foreigner, an Amalekite,” he answered."
"9650","2 Samuel","1","14","David asked him, “Why weren’t you afraid to lift your hand to destroy the Lord’s anointed?”"
"9651","2 Samuel","1","15","Then David called one of his men and said, “Go, strike him down!” So he struck him down, and he died. "
"9652","2 Samuel","1","16","For David had said to him, “Your blood be on your own head. Your own mouth testified against you when you said, ‘I killed the Lord’s anointed.’ ”David’s Lament for Saul and Jonathan"
"9653","2 Samuel","1","17","David took up this lament concerning Saul and his son Jonathan, "
"9654","2 Samuel","1","18","and he ordered that the people of Judah be taught this lament of the bow (it is written in the Book of Jashar): "
"9655","2 Samuel","1","19","""A gazelle1:19 Gazelle here symbolizes a human dignitary. lies slain on your heights, Israel.How the mighty have fallen! "
"9656","2 Samuel","1","20","""Tell it not in Gath,proclaim it not in the streets of Ashkelon,lest the daughters of the Philistines be glad,lest the daughters of the uncircumcised rejoice. "
"9657","2 Samuel","1","21","""Mountains of Gilboa,may you have neither dew nor rain,may no showers fall on your terraced fields.1:21 Or / nor fields that yield grain for offeringsFor there the shield of the mighty was despised,the shield of Saul—no longer rubbed with oil. "
"9658","2 Samuel","1","22","""From the blood of the slain,from the flesh of the mighty,the bow of Jonathan did not turn back,the sword of Saul did not return unsatisfied."
"9659","2 Samuel","1","23","Saul and Jonathan—in life they were loved and admired,and in death they were not parted.They were swifter than eagles,they were stronger than lions. "
"9660","2 Samuel","1","24","""Daughters of Israel,weep for Saul,who clothed you in scarlet and finery,who adorned your garments with ornaments of gold. "
"9661","2 Samuel","1","25","""How the mighty have fallen in battle!Jonathan lies slain on your heights."
"9662","2 Samuel","1","26","I grieve for you, Jonathan my brother;you were very dear to me.Your love for me was wonderful,more wonderful than that of women. "
"9663","2 Samuel","1","27","""How the mighty have fallen!The weapons of war have perished!”"
"9664","2 Samuel","2","1","In the course of time, David inquired of the Lord. “Shall I go up to one of the towns of Judah?” he asked.The Lord said, “Go up.”David asked, “Where shall I go?”“To Hebron,” the Lord answered."
"9665","2 Samuel","2","2","So David went up there with his two wives, Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail, the widow of Nabal of Carmel. "
"9666","2 Samuel","2","3","David also took the men who were with him, each with his family, and they settled in Hebron and its towns. "
"9667","2 Samuel","2","4","Then the men of Judah came to Hebron, and there they anointed David king over the tribe of Judah.When David was told that it was the men from Jabesh Gilead who had buried Saul, "
"9668","2 Samuel","2","5","he sent messengers to them to say to them, “The Lord bless you for showing this kindness to Saul your master by burying him. "
"9669","2 Samuel","2","6","May the Lord now show you kindness and faithfulness, and I too will show you the same favor because you have done this. "
"9670","2 Samuel","2","7","Now then, be strong and brave, for Saul your master is dead, and the people of Judah have anointed me king over them.”War Between the Houses of David and Saul"
"9671","2 Samuel","2","8","Meanwhile, Abner son of Ner, the commander of Saul’s army, had taken Ish-Bosheth son of Saul and brought him over to Mahanaim. "
"9672","2 Samuel","2","9","He made him king over Gilead, Ashuri and Jezreel, and also over Ephraim, Benjamin and all Israel."
"9673","2 Samuel","2","10","Ish-Bosheth son of Saul was forty years old when he became king over Israel, and he reigned two years. The tribe of Judah, however, remained loyal to David. "
"9674","2 Samuel","2","11","The length of time David was king in Hebron over Judah was seven years and six months."
"9675","2 Samuel","2","12","Abner son of Ner, together with the men of Ish-Bosheth son of Saul, left Mahanaim and went to Gibeon. "
"9676","2 Samuel","2","13","Joab son of Zeruiah and David’s men went out and met them at the pool of Gibeon. One group sat down on one side of the pool and one group on the other side."
"9677","2 Samuel","2","14","Then Abner said to Joab, “Let’s have some of the young men get up and fight hand to hand in front of us.”“All right, let them do it,” Joab said."
"9678","2 Samuel","2","15","So they stood up and were counted off—twelve men for Benjamin and Ish-Bosheth son of Saul, and twelve for David. "
"9679","2 Samuel","2","16","Then each man grabbed his opponent by the head and thrust his dagger into his opponent’s side, and they fell down together. So that place in Gibeon was called Helkath Hazzurim.2:16 Helkath Hazzurim means field of daggers or field of hostilities."
"9680","2 Samuel","2","17","The battle that day was very fierce, and Abner and the Israelites were defeated by David’s men."
"9681","2 Samuel","2","18","The three sons of Zeruiah were there: Joab, Abishai and Asahel. Now Asahel was as fleet-footed as a wild gazelle. "
"9682","2 Samuel","2","19","He chased Abner, turning neither to the right nor to the left as he pursued him. "
"9683","2 Samuel","2","20","Abner looked behind him and asked, “Is that you, Asahel?”“It is,” he answered."
"9684","2 Samuel","2","21","Then Abner said to him, “Turn aside to the right or to the left; take on one of the young men and strip him of his weapons.” But Asahel would not stop chasing him."
"9685","2 Samuel","2","22","Again Abner warned Asahel, “Stop chasing me! Why should I strike you down? How could I look your brother Joab in the face?”"
"9686","2 Samuel","2","23","But Asahel refused to give up the pursuit; so Abner thrust the butt of his spear into Asahel’s stomach, and the spear came out through his back. He fell there and died on the spot. And every man stopped when he came to the place where Asahel had fallen and died."
"9687","2 Samuel","2","24","But Joab and Abishai pursued Abner, and as the sun was setting, they came to the hill of Ammah, near Giah on the way to the wasteland of Gibeon. "
"9688","2 Samuel","2","25","Then the men of Benjamin rallied behind Abner. They formed themselves into a group and took their stand on top of a hill."
"9689","2 Samuel","2","26","Abner called out to Joab, “Must the sword devour forever? Don’t you realize that this will end in bitterness? How long before you order your men to stop pursuing their fellow Israelites?”"
"9690","2 Samuel","2","27","Joab answered, “As surely as God lives, if you had not spoken, the men would have continued pursuing them until morning.”"
"9691","2 Samuel","2","28","So Joab blew the trumpet, and all the troops came to a halt; they no longer pursued Israel, nor did they fight anymore."
"9692","2 Samuel","2","29","All that night Abner and his men marched through the Arabah. They crossed the Jordan, continued through the morning hours2:29 See Septuagint; the meaning of the Hebrew for this phrase is uncertain. and came to Mahanaim."
"9693","2 Samuel","2","30","Then Joab stopped pursuing Abner and assembled the whole army. Besides Asahel, nineteen of David’s men were found missing. "
"9694","2 Samuel","2","31","But David’s men had killed three hundred and sixty Benjamites who were with Abner. "
"9695","2 Samuel","2","32","They took Asahel and buried him in his father’s tomb at Bethlehem. Then Joab and his men marched all night and arrived at Hebron by daybreak."
"9696","2 Samuel","3","1","The war between the house of Saul and the house of David lasted a long time. David grew stronger and stronger, while the house of Saul grew weaker and weaker."
"9697","2 Samuel","3","2","Sons were born to David in Hebron:His firstborn was Amnon the son of Ahinoam of Jezreel;"

"9701","2 Samuel","3","6","During the war between the house of Saul and the house of David, Abner had been strengthening his own position in the house of Saul. "
"9702","2 Samuel","3","7","Now Saul had had a concubine named Rizpah daughter of Aiah. And Ish-Bosheth said to Abner, “Why did you sleep with my father’s concubine?”"
"9703","2 Samuel","3","8","Abner was very angry because of what Ish-Bosheth said. So he answered, “Am I a dog’s head—on Judah’s side? This very day I am loyal to the house of your father Saul and to his family and friends. I haven’t handed you over to David. Yet now you accuse me of an offense involving this woman! "
"9704","2 Samuel","3","9","May God deal with Abner, be it ever so severely, if I do not do for David what the Lord promised him on oath "
"9705","2 Samuel","3","10","and transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul and establish David’s throne over Israel and Judah from Dan to Beersheba.” "
"9706","2 Samuel","3","11","Ish-Bosheth did not dare to say another word to Abner, because he was afraid of him."
"9707","2 Samuel","3","12","Then Abner sent messengers on his behalf to say to David, “Whose land is it? Make an agreement with me, and I will help you bring all Israel over to you.” "
"9708","2 Samuel","3","13","""Good,” said David. “I will make an agreement with you. But I demand one thing of you: Do not come into my presence unless you bring Michal daughter of Saul when you come to see me.” "
"9709","2 Samuel","3","14","Then David sent messengers to Ish-Bosheth son of Saul, demanding, “Give me my wife Michal, whom I betrothed to myself for the price of a hundred Philistine foreskins.”"
"9710","2 Samuel","3","15","So Ish-Bosheth gave orders and had her taken away from her husband Paltiel son of Laish. "
"9711","2 Samuel","3","16","Her husband, however, went with her, weeping behind her all the way to Bahurim. Then Abner said to him, “Go back home!” So he went back."
"9712","2 Samuel","3","17","Abner conferred with the elders of Israel and said, “For some time you have wanted to make David your king. "
"9713","2 Samuel","3","18","Now do it! For the Lord promised David, ‘By my servant David I will rescue my people Israel from the hand of the Philistines and from the hand of all their enemies.’ ”"
"9714","2 Samuel","3","19","Abner also spoke to the Benjamites in person. Then he went to Hebron to tell David everything that Israel and the whole tribe of Benjamin wanted to do. "
"9715","2 Samuel","3","20","When Abner, who had twenty men with him, came to David at Hebron, David prepared a feast for him and his men. "
"9716","2 Samuel","3","21","Then Abner said to David, “Let me go at once and assemble all Israel for my lord the king, so that they may make a covenant with you, and that you may rule over all that your heart desires.” So David sent Abner away, and he went in peace.Joab Murders Abner"
"9717","2 Samuel","3","22","Just then David’s men and Joab returned from a raid and brought with them a great deal of plunder. But Abner was no longer with David in Hebron, because David had sent him away, and he had gone in peace. "
"9718","2 Samuel","3","23","When Joab and all the soldiers with him arrived, he was told that Abner son of Ner had come to the king and that the king had sent him away and that he had gone in peace."
"9719","2 Samuel","3","24","So Joab went to the king and said, “What have you done? Look, Abner came to you. Why did you let him go? Now he is gone! "
"9720","2 Samuel","3","25","You know Abner son of Ner; he came to deceive you and observe your movements and find out everything you are doing.”"
"9721","2 Samuel","3","26","Joab then left David and sent messengers after Abner, and they brought him back from the cistern at Sirah. But David did not know it. "
"9722","2 Samuel","3","27","Now when Abner returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside into an inner chamber, as if to speak with him privately. And there, to avenge the blood of his brother Asahel, Joab stabbed him in the stomach, and he died."
"9723","2 Samuel","3","28","Later, when David heard about this, he said, “I and my kingdom are forever innocent before the Lord concerning the blood of Abner son of Ner. "
"9724","2 Samuel","3","29","May his blood fall on the head of Joab and on his whole family! May Joab’s family never be without someone who has a running sore or leprosy3:29 The Hebrew for leprosy was used for various diseases affecting the skin. or who leans on a crutch or who falls by the sword or who lacks food.”30(Joab and his brother Abishai murdered Abner because he had killed their brother Asahel in the battle at Gibeon.)"
"9725","2 Samuel","3","31","Then David said to Joab and all the people with him, “Tear your clothes and put on sackcloth and walk in mourning in front of Abner.” King David himself walked behind the bier. "
"9726","2 Samuel","3","32","They buried Abner in Hebron, and the king wept aloud at Abner’s tomb. All the people wept also."
"9727","2 Samuel","3","33","The king sang this lament for Abner:“Should Abner have died as the lawless die?"
"9728","2 Samuel","3","34","Your hands were not bound,your feet were not fettered.You fell as one falls before the wicked.”And all the people wept over him again."
"9729","2 Samuel","3","35","Then they all came and urged David to eat something while it was still day; but David took an oath, saying, “May God deal with me, be it ever so severely, if I taste bread or anything else before the sun sets!”"
"9730","2 Samuel","3","36","All the people took note and were pleased; indeed, everything the king did pleased them. "
"9731","2 Samuel","3","37","So on that day all the people there and all Israel knew that the king had no part in the murder of Abner son of Ner."
"9732","2 Samuel","3","38","Then the king said to his men, “Do you not realize that a commander and a great man has fallen in Israel this day? "
"9733","2 Samuel","3","39","And today, though I am the anointed king, I am weak, and these sons of Zeruiah are too strong for me. May the Lord repay the evildoer according to his evil deeds!”"
"9734","2 Samuel","4","1","When Ish-Bosheth son of Saul heard that Abner had died in Hebron, he lost courage, and all Israel became alarmed. "
"9735","2 Samuel","4","2","Now Saul’s son had two men who were leaders of raiding bands. One was named Baanah and the other Rekab; they were sons of Rimmon the Beerothite from the tribe of Benjamin—Beeroth is considered part of Benjamin, "
"9736","2 Samuel","4","3","because the people of Beeroth fled to Gittaim and have resided there as foreigners to this day.4(Jonathan son of Saul had a son who was lame in both feet. He was five years old when the news about Saul and Jonathan came from Jezreel. His nurse picked him up and fled, but as she hurried to leave, he fell and became disabled. His name was Mephibosheth.)"
"9737","2 Samuel","4","5","Now Rekab and Baanah, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, set out for the house of Ish-Bosheth, and they arrived there in the heat of the day while he was taking his noonday rest. "
"9738","2 Samuel","4","6","They went into the inner part of the house as if to get some wheat, and they stabbed him in the stomach. Then Rekab and his brother Baanah slipped away."
"9739","2 Samuel","4","7","They had gone into the house while he was lying on the bed in his bedroom. After they stabbed and killed him, they cut off his head. Taking it with them, they traveled all night by way of the Arabah. "
"9740","2 Samuel","4","8","They brought the head of Ish-Bosheth to David at Hebron and said to the king, “Here is the head of Ish-Bosheth son of Saul, your enemy, who tried to kill you. This day the Lord has avenged my lord the king against Saul and his offspring.”"
"9741","2 Samuel","4","9","David answered Rekab and his brother Baanah, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, “As surely as the Lord lives, who has delivered me out of every trouble, "
"9742","2 Samuel","4","10","when someone told me, ‘Saul is dead,’ and thought he was bringing good news, I seized him and put him to death in Ziklag. That was the reward I gave him for his news! "
"9743","2 Samuel","4","11","How much more—when wicked men have killed an innocent man in his own house and on his own bed—should I not now demand his blood from your hand and rid the earth of you!”"
"9744","2 Samuel","4","12","So David gave an order to his men, and they killed them. They cut off their hands and feet and hung the bodies by the pool in Hebron. But they took the head of Ish-Bosheth and buried it in Abner’s tomb at Hebron."
"9745","2 Samuel","5","1","All the tribes of Israel came to David at Hebron and said, “We are your own flesh and blood. "
"9746","2 Samuel","5","2","In the past, while Saul was king over us, you were the one who led Israel on their military campaigns. And the Lord said to you, ‘You will shepherd my people Israel, and you will become their ruler.’ ”"
"9747","2 Samuel","5","3","When all the elders of Israel had come to King David at Hebron, the king made a covenant with them at Hebron before the Lord, and they anointed David king over Israel."
"9748","2 Samuel","5","4","David was thirty years old when he became king, and he reigned forty years. "
"9749","2 Samuel","5","5","In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months, and in Jerusalem he reigned over all Israel and Judah thirty-three years.David Conquers Jerusalem"
"9750","2 Samuel","5","6","The king and his men marched to Jerusalem to attack the Jebusites, who lived there. The Jebusites said to David, “You will not get in here; even the blind and the lame can ward you off.” They thought, “David cannot get in here.” "
"9751","2 Samuel","5","7","Nevertheless, David captured the fortress of Zion—which is the City of David."
"9752","2 Samuel","5","8","On that day David had said, “Anyone who conquers the Jebusites will have to use the water shaft to reach those ‘lame and blind’ who are David’s enemies.5:8 Or are hated by David” That is why they say, “The ‘blind and lame’ will not enter the palace.”"
"9753","2 Samuel","5","9","David then took up residence in the fortress and called it the City of David. He built up the area around it, from the terraces5:9 Or the Millo inward. "
"9754","2 Samuel","5","10","And he became more and more powerful, because the Lord God Almighty was with him."
"9755","2 Samuel","5","11","Now Hiram king of Tyre sent envoys to David, along with cedar logs and carpenters and stonemasons, and they built a palace for David. "
"9756","2 Samuel","5","12","Then David knew that the Lord had established him as king over Israel and had exalted his kingdom for the sake of his people Israel."
"9757","2 Samuel","5","13","After he left Hebron, David took more concubines and wives in Jerusalem, and more sons and daughters were born to him. "
"9758","2 Samuel","5","14","These are the names of the children born to him there: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon, "
"9759","2 Samuel","5","15","Ibhar, Elishua, Nepheg, Japhia, "
"9760","2 Samuel","5","16","Elishama, Eliada and Eliphelet.David Defeats the Philistines"
"9761","2 Samuel","5","17","When the Philistines heard that David had been anointed king over Israel, they went up in full force to search for him, but David heard about it and went down to the stronghold. "
"9762","2 Samuel","5","18","Now the Philistines had come and spread out in the Valley of Rephaim; "
"9763","2 Samuel","5","19","so David inquired of the Lord, “Shall I go and attack the Philistines? Will you deliver them into my hands?”The Lord answered him, “Go, for I will surely deliver the Philistines into your hands.”"
"9764","2 Samuel","5","20","So David went to Baal Perazim, and there he defeated them. He said, “As waters break out, the Lord has broken out against my enemies before me.” So that place was called Baal Perazim.5:20 Baal Perazim means the lord who breaks out. "
"9765","2 Samuel","5","21","The Philistines abandoned their idols there, and David and his men carried them off."
"9766","2 Samuel","5","22","Once more the Philistines came up and spread out in the Valley of Rephaim; "
"9767","2 Samuel","5","23","so David inquired of the Lord, and he answered, “Do not go straight up, but circle around behind them and attack them in front of the poplar trees. "
"9768","2 Samuel","5","24","As soon as you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the poplar trees, move quickly, because that will mean the Lord has gone out in front of you to strike the Philistine army.” "
"9769","2 Samuel","5","25","So David did as the Lord commanded him, and he struck down the Philistines all the way from Gibeon5:25 Septuagint (see also 1 Chron. 14:16); Hebrew Geba to Gezer."
"9770","2 Samuel","6","1","David again brought together all the able young men of Israel—thirty thousand. "
"9771","2 Samuel","6","2","He and all his men went to Baalah6:2 That is, Kiriath Jearim (see 1 Chron. 13:6) in Judah to bring up from there the ark of God, which is called by the Name,6:2 Hebrew; Septuagint and Vulgate do not have the Name. the name of the Lord Almighty, who is enthroned between the cherubim on the ark. "
"9772","2 Samuel","6","3","They set the ark of God on a new cart and brought it from the house of Abinadab, which was on the hill. Uzzah and Ahio, sons of Abinadab, were guiding the new cart "
"9773","2 Samuel","6","4","with the ark of God on it,6:3,4 Dead Sea Scrolls and some Septuagint manuscripts; Masoretic Text cart 4 and they brought it with the ark of God from the house of Abinadab, which was on the hill and Ahio was walking in front of it. "
"9774","2 Samuel","6","5","David and all Israel were celebrating with all their might before the Lord, with castanets,6:5 Masoretic Text; Dead Sea Scrolls and Septuagint (see also 1 Chron. 13:8) songs harps, lyres, timbrels, sistrums and cymbals."
"9775","2 Samuel","6","6","When they came to the threshing floor of Nakon, Uzzah reached out and took hold of the ark of God, because the oxen stumbled. "
"9776","2 Samuel","6","7","The Lord’s anger burned against Uzzah because of his irreverent act; therefore God struck him down, and he died there beside the ark of God."
"9777","2 Samuel","6","8","Then David was angry because the Lord’s wrath had broken out against Uzzah, and to this day that place is called Perez Uzzah.6:8 Perez Uzzah means outbreak against Uzzah."
"9778","2 Samuel","6","9","David was afraid of the Lord that day and said, “How can the ark of the Lord ever come to me?” "
"9779","2 Samuel","6","10","He was not willing to take the ark of the Lord to be with him in the City of David. Instead, he took it to the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite. "
"9780","2 Samuel","6","11","The ark of the Lord remained in the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite for three months, and the Lord blessed him and his entire household."
"9781","2 Samuel","6","12","Now King David was told, “The Lord has blessed the household of Obed-Edom and everything he has, because of the ark of God.” So David went to bring up the ark of God from the house of Obed-Edom to the City of David with rejoicing. "
"9782","2 Samuel","6","13","When those who were carrying the ark of the Lord had taken six steps, he sacrificed a bull and a fattened calf. "
"9783","2 Samuel","6","14","Wearing a linen ephod, David was dancing before the Lord with all his might, "
"9784","2 Samuel","6","15","while he and all Israel were bringing up the ark of the Lord with shouts and the sound of trumpets."
"9785","2 Samuel","6","16","As the ark of the Lord was entering the City of David, Michal daughter of Saul watched from a window. And when she saw King David leaping and dancing before the Lord, she despised him in her heart."
"9786","2 Samuel","6","17","They brought the ark of the Lord and set it in its place inside the tent that David had pitched for it, and David sacrificed burnt offerings and fellowship offerings before the Lord. "
"9787","2 Samuel","6","18","After he had finished sacrificing the burnt offerings and fellowship offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the Lord Almighty. "
"9788","2 Samuel","6","19","Then he gave a loaf of bread, a cake of dates and a cake of raisins to each person in the whole crowd of Israelites, both men and women. And all the people went to their homes."
"9789","2 Samuel","6","20","When David returned home to bless his household, Michal daughter of Saul came out to meet him and said, “How the king of Israel has distinguished himself today, going around half-naked in full view of the slave girls of his servants as any vulgar fellow would!”"
"9790","2 Samuel","6","21","David said to Michal, “It was before the Lord, who chose me rather than your father or anyone from his house when he appointed me ruler over the Lord’s people Israel—I will celebrate before the Lord. "
"9791","2 Samuel","6","22","I will become even more undignified than this, and I will be humiliated in my own eyes. But by these slave girls you spoke of, I will be held in honor.”"
"9792","2 Samuel","6","23","And Michal daughter of Saul had no children to the day of her death."
"9793","2 Samuel","7","1","After the king was settled in his palace and the Lord had given him rest from all his enemies around him, "

"9850","2 Samuel","9","11","Then Ziba said to the king, “Your servant will do whatever my lord the king commands his servant to do.” So Mephibosheth ate at David’s9:11 Septuagint; Hebrew my table like one of the king’s sons."
"9851","2 Samuel","9","12","Mephibosheth had a young son named Mika, and all the members of Ziba’s household were servants of Mephibosheth. "
"9852","2 Samuel","9","13","And Mephibosheth lived in Jerusalem, because he always ate at the king’s table; he was lame in both feet."
"9853","2 Samuel","10","1","In the course of time, the king of the Ammonites died, and his son Hanun succeeded him as king. "
"9854","2 Samuel","10","2","David thought, “I will show kindness to Hanun son of Nahash, just as his father showed kindness to me.” So David sent a delegation to express his sympathy to Hanun concerning his father.When David’s men came to the land of the Ammonites, "
"9855","2 Samuel","10","3","the Ammonite commanders said to Hanun their lord, “Do you think David is honoring your father by sending envoys to you to express sympathy? Hasn’t David sent them to you only to explore the city and spy it out and overthrow it?” "
"9856","2 Samuel","10","4","So Hanun seized David’s envoys, shaved off half of each man’s beard, cut off their garments at the buttocks, and sent them away."
"9857","2 Samuel","10","5","When David was told about this, he sent messengers to meet the men, for they were greatly humiliated. The king said, “Stay at Jericho till your beards have grown, and then come back.”"
"9858","2 Samuel","10","6","When the Ammonites realized that they had become obnoxious to David, they hired twenty thousand Aramean foot soldiers from Beth Rehob and Zobah, as well as the king of Maakah with a thousand men, and also twelve thousand men from Tob."
"9859","2 Samuel","10","7","On hearing this, David sent Joab out with the entire army of fighting men. "
"9860","2 Samuel","10","8","The Ammonites came out and drew up in battle formation at the entrance of their city gate, while the Arameans of Zobah and Rehob and the men of Tob and Maakah were by themselves in the open country."
"9861","2 Samuel","10","9","Joab saw that there were battle lines in front of him and behind him; so he selected some of the best troops in Israel and deployed them against the Arameans. "
"9862","2 Samuel","10","10","He put the rest of the men under the command of Abishai his brother and deployed them against the Ammonites. "
"9863","2 Samuel","10","11","Joab said, “If the Arameans are too strong for me, then you are to come to my rescue; but if the Ammonites are too strong for you, then I will come to rescue you. "
"9864","2 Samuel","10","12","Be strong, and let us fight bravely for our people and the cities of our God. The Lord will do what is good in his sight.”"
"9865","2 Samuel","10","13","Then Joab and the troops with him advanced to fight the Arameans, and they fled before him. "
"9866","2 Samuel","10","14","When the Ammonites realized that the Arameans were fleeing, they fled before Abishai and went inside the city. So Joab returned from fighting the Ammonites and came to Jerusalem."
"9867","2 Samuel","10","15","After the Arameans saw that they had been routed by Israel, they regrouped. "
"9868","2 Samuel","10","16","Hadadezer had Arameans brought from beyond the Euphrates River; they went to Helam, with Shobak the commander of Hadadezer’s army leading them."
"9869","2 Samuel","10","17","When David was told of this, he gathered all Israel, crossed the Jordan and went to Helam. The Arameans formed their battle lines to meet David and fought against him. "
"9870","2 Samuel","10","18","But they fled before Israel, and David killed seven hundred of their charioteers and forty thousand of their foot soldiers.10:18 Some Septuagint manuscripts (see also 1 Chron. 19:18); Hebrew horsemen He also struck down Shobak the commander of their army, and he died there. "
"9871","2 Samuel","10","19","When all the kings who were vassals of Hadadezer saw that they had been routed by Israel, they made peace with the Israelites and became subject to them.So the Arameans were afraid to help the Ammonites anymore."
"9872","2 Samuel","11","1","In the spring, at the time when kings go off to war, David sent Joab out with the king’s men and the whole Israelite army. They destroyed the Ammonites and besieged Rabbah. But David remained in Jerusalem."
"9873","2 Samuel","11","2","One evening David got up from his bed and walked around on the roof of the palace. From the roof he saw a woman bathing. The woman was very beautiful, "
"9874","2 Samuel","11","3","and David sent someone to find out about her. The man said, “She is Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam and the wife of Uriah the Hittite.” "
"9875","2 Samuel","11","4","Then David sent messengers to get her. She came to him, and he slept with her. (Now she was purifying herself from her monthly uncleanness.) Then she went back home. "
"9876","2 Samuel","11","5","The woman conceived and sent word to David, saying, “I am pregnant.”"
"9877","2 Samuel","11","6","So David sent this word to Joab: “Send me Uriah the Hittite.” And Joab sent him to David. "
"9878","2 Samuel","11","7","When Uriah came to him, David asked him how Joab was, how the soldiers were and how the war was going. "
"9879","2 Samuel","11","8","Then David said to Uriah, “Go down to your house and wash your feet.” So Uriah left the palace, and a gift from the king was sent after him. "
"9880","2 Samuel","11","9","But Uriah slept at the entrance to the palace with all his master’s servants and did not go down to his house."
"9881","2 Samuel","11","10","David was told, “Uriah did not go home.” So he asked Uriah, “Haven’t you just come from a military campaign? Why didn’t you go home?”"
"9882","2 Samuel","11","11","Uriah said to David, “The ark and Israel and Judah are staying in tents,11:11 Or staying at Sukkoth and my commander Joab and my lord’s men are camped in the open country. How could I go to my house to eat and drink and make love to my wife? As surely as you live, I will not do such a thing!”"
"9883","2 Samuel","11","12","Then David said to him, “Stay here one more day, and tomorrow I will send you back.” So Uriah remained in Jerusalem that day and the next. "
"9884","2 Samuel","11","13","At David’s invitation, he ate and drank with him, and David made him drunk. But in the evening Uriah went out to sleep on his mat among his master’s servants; he did not go home."
"9885","2 Samuel","11","14","In the morning David wrote a letter to Joab and sent it with Uriah. "
"9886","2 Samuel","11","15","In it he wrote, “Put Uriah out in front where the fighting is fiercest. Then withdraw from him so he will be struck down and die.”"
"9887","2 Samuel","11","16","So while Joab had the city under siege, he put Uriah at a place where he knew the strongest defenders were. "
"9888","2 Samuel","11","17","When the men of the city came out and fought against Joab, some of the men in David’s army fell; moreover, Uriah the Hittite died."
"9889","2 Samuel","11","18","Joab sent David a full account of the battle. "
"9890","2 Samuel","11","19","He instructed the messenger: “When you have finished giving the king this account of the battle, "
"9891","2 Samuel","11","20","the king’s anger may flare up, and he may ask you, ‘Why did you get so close to the city to fight? Didn’t you know they would shoot arrows from the wall? "
"9892","2 Samuel","11","21","Who killed Abimelek son of Jerub-Besheth11:21 Also known as Jerub-Baal (that is, Gideon)? Didn’t a woman drop an upper millstone on him from the wall, so that he died in Thebez? Why did you get so close to the wall?’ If he asks you this, then say to him, ‘Moreover, your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead.’ ”"
"9893","2 Samuel","11","22","The messenger set out, and when he arrived he told David everything Joab had sent him to say. "
"9894","2 Samuel","11","23","The messenger said to David, “The men overpowered us and came out against us in the open, but we drove them back to the entrance of the city gate. "
"9895","2 Samuel","11","24","Then the archers shot arrows at your servants from the wall, and some of the king’s men died. Moreover, your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead.”"
"9896","2 Samuel","11","25","David told the messenger, “Say this to Joab: ‘Don’t let this upset you; the sword devours one as well as another. Press the attack against the city and destroy it.’ Say this to encourage Joab.”"
"9897","2 Samuel","11","26","When Uriah’s wife heard that her husband was dead, she mourned for him. "
"9898","2 Samuel","11","27","After the time of mourning was over, David had her brought to his house, and she became his wife and bore him a son. But the thing David had done displeased the Lord."
"9899","2 Samuel","12","1","The Lord sent Nathan to David. When he came to him, he said, “There were two men in a certain town, one rich and the other poor. "
"9900","2 Samuel","12","2","The rich man had a very large number of sheep and cattle, "
"9901","2 Samuel","12","3","but the poor man had nothing except one little ewe lamb he had bought. He raised it, and it grew up with him and his children. It shared his food, drank from his cup and even slept in his arms. It was like a daughter to him. "
"9902","2 Samuel","12","4","""Now a traveler came to the rich man, but the rich man refrained from taking one of his own sheep or cattle to prepare a meal for the traveler who had come to him. Instead, he took the ewe lamb that belonged to the poor man and prepared it for the one who had come to him.”"
"9903","2 Samuel","12","5","David burned with anger against the man and said to Nathan, “As surely as the Lord lives, the man who did this must die! "
"9904","2 Samuel","12","6","He must pay for that lamb four times over, because he did such a thing and had no pity.”"
"9905","2 Samuel","12","7","Then Nathan said to David, “You are the man! This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: ‘I anointed you king over Israel, and I delivered you from the hand of Saul. "
"9906","2 Samuel","12","8","I gave your master’s house to you, and your master’s wives into your arms. I gave you all Israel and Judah. And if all this had been too little, I would have given you even more. "
"9907","2 Samuel","12","9","Why did you despise the word of the Lord by doing what is evil in his eyes? You struck down Uriah the Hittite with the sword and took his wife to be your own. You killed him with the sword of the Ammonites. "
"9908","2 Samuel","12","10","Now, therefore, the sword will never depart from your house, because you despised me and took the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your own.’ "
"9909","2 Samuel","12","11","""This is what the Lord says: ‘Out of your own household I am going to bring calamity on you. Before your very eyes I will take your wives and give them to one who is close to you, and he will sleep with your wives in broad daylight. "
"9910","2 Samuel","12","12","You did it in secret, but I will do this thing in broad daylight before all Israel.’ ”"
"9911","2 Samuel","12","13","Then David said to Nathan, “I have sinned against the Lord.”Nathan replied, “The Lord has taken away your sin. You are not going to die. "
"9912","2 Samuel","12","14","But because by doing this you have shown utter contempt for12:14 An ancient Hebrew scribal tradition; Masoretic Text for the enemies of the Lord, the son born to you will die.”"
"9913","2 Samuel","12","15","After Nathan had gone home, the Lord struck the child that Uriah’s wife had borne to David, and he became ill. "
"9914","2 Samuel","12","16","David pleaded with God for the child. He fasted and spent the nights lying in sackcloth12:16 Dead Sea Scrolls and Septuagint; Masoretic Text does not have in sackcloth. on the ground. "
"9915","2 Samuel","12","17","The elders of his household stood beside him to get him up from the ground, but he refused, and he would not eat any food with them."
"9916","2 Samuel","12","18","On the seventh day the child died. David’s attendants were afraid to tell him that the child was dead, for they thought, “While the child was still living, he wouldn’t listen to us when we spoke to him. How can we now tell him the child is dead? He may do something desperate.”"
"9917","2 Samuel","12","19","David noticed that his attendants were whispering among themselves, and he realized the child was dead. “Is the child dead?” he asked.“Yes,” they replied, “he is dead.”"
"9918","2 Samuel","12","20","Then David got up from the ground. After he had washed, put on lotions and changed his clothes, he went into the house of the Lord and worshiped. Then he went to his own house, and at his request they served him food, and he ate."
"9919","2 Samuel","12","21","His attendants asked him, “Why are you acting this way? While the child was alive, you fasted and wept, but now that the child is dead, you get up and eat!”"
"9920","2 Samuel","12","22","He answered, “While the child was still alive, I fasted and wept. I thought, ‘Who knows? The Lord may be gracious to me and let the child live.’ "
"9921","2 Samuel","12","23","But now that he is dead, why should I go on fasting? Can I bring him back again? I will go to him, but he will not return to me.”"
"9922","2 Samuel","12","24","Then David comforted his wife Bathsheba, and he went to her and made love to her. She gave birth to a son, and they named him Solomon. The Lord loved him; "
"9923","2 Samuel","12","25","and because the Lord loved him, he sent word through Nathan the prophet to name him Jedidiah.12:25 Jedidiah means loved by the Lord."
"9924","2 Samuel","12","26","Meanwhile Joab fought against Rabbah of the Ammonites and captured the royal citadel. "
"9925","2 Samuel","12","27","Joab then sent messengers to David, saying, “I have fought against Rabbah and taken its water supply. "
"9926","2 Samuel","12","28","Now muster the rest of the troops and besiege the city and capture it. Otherwise I will take the city, and it will be named after me.”"
"9927","2 Samuel","12","29","So David mustered the entire army and went to Rabbah, and attacked and captured it. "
"9928","2 Samuel","12","30","David took the crown from their king’s12:30 Or from Milkom’s (that is, Molek’s) head, and it was placed on his own head. It weighed a talent12:30 That is, about 75 pounds or about 34 kilograms of gold, and it was set with precious stones. David took a great quantity of plunder from the city "
"9929","2 Samuel","12","31","and brought out the people who were there, consigning them to labor with saws and with iron picks and axes, and he made them work at brickmaking.12:31 The meaning of the Hebrew for this clause is uncertain. David did this to all the Ammonite towns. Then he and his entire army returned to Jerusalem."
"9930","2 Samuel","13","1","In the course of time, Amnon son of David fell in love with Tamar, the beautiful sister of Absalom son of David."
"9931","2 Samuel","13","2","Amnon became so obsessed with his sister Tamar that he made himself ill. She was a virgin, and it seemed impossible for him to do anything to her."
"9932","2 Samuel","13","3","Now Amnon had an adviser named Jonadab son of Shimeah, David’s brother. Jonadab was a very shrewd man. "
"9933","2 Samuel","13","4","He asked Amnon, “Why do you, the king’s son, look so haggard morning after morning? Won’t you tell me?”Amnon said to him, “I’m in love with Tamar, my brother Absalom’s sister.” "
"9934","2 Samuel","13","5","""Go to bed and pretend to be ill,” Jonadab said. “When your father comes to see you, say to him, ‘I would like my sister Tamar to come and give me something to eat. Let her prepare the food in my sight so I may watch her and then eat it from her hand.’ ”"
"9935","2 Samuel","13","6","So Amnon lay down and pretended to be ill. When the king came to see him, Amnon said to him, “I would like my sister Tamar to come and make some special bread in my sight, so I may eat from her hand.”"
"9936","2 Samuel","13","7","David sent word to Tamar at the palace: “Go to the house of your brother Amnon and prepare some food for him.” "
"9937","2 Samuel","13","8","So Tamar went to the house of her brother Amnon, who was lying down. She took some dough, kneaded it, made the bread in his sight and baked it. "
"9938","2 Samuel","13","9","Then she took the pan and served him the bread, but he refused to eat.“Send everyone out of here,” Amnon said. So everyone left him. "
"9939","2 Samuel","13","10","Then Amnon said to Tamar, “Bring the food here into my bedroom so I may eat from your hand.” And Tamar took the bread she had prepared and brought it to her brother Amnon in his bedroom. "
"9940","2 Samuel","13","11","But when she took it to him to eat, he grabbed her and said, “Come to bed with me, my sister.” "
"9941","2 Samuel","13","12","""No, my brother!” she said to him. “Don’t force me! Such a thing should not be done in Israel! Don’t do this wicked thing. "
"9942","2 Samuel","13","13","What about me? Where could I get rid of my disgrace? And what about you? You would be like one of the wicked fools in Israel. Please speak to the king; he will not keep me from being married to you.” "
"9943","2 Samuel","13","14","But he refused to listen to her, and since he was stronger than she, he raped her."
"9944","2 Samuel","13","15","Then Amnon hated her with intense hatred. In fact, he hated her more than he had loved her. Amnon said to her, “Get up and get out!” "
"9945","2 Samuel","13","16","""No!” she said to him. “Sending me away would be a greater wrong than what you have already done to me.”But he refused to listen to her. "
"9946","2 Samuel","13","17","He called his personal servant and said, “Get this woman out of my sight and bolt the door after her.” "
"9947","2 Samuel","13","18","So his servant put her out and bolted the door after her. She was wearing an ornate13:18 The meaning of the Hebrew for this word is uncertain; also in verse 19. robe, for this was the kind of garment the virgin daughters of the king wore. "
"9948","2 Samuel","13","19","Tamar put ashes on her head and tore the ornate robe she was wearing. She put her hands on her head and went away, weeping aloud as she went."
"9949","2 Samuel","13","20","Her brother Absalom said to her, “Has that Amnon, your brother, been with you? Be quiet for now, my sister; he is your brother. Don’t take this thing to heart.” And Tamar lived in her brother Absalom’s house, a desolate woman."
"9950","2 Samuel","13","21","When King David heard all this, he was furious. "
"9951","2 Samuel","13","22","And Absalom never said a word to Amnon, either good or bad; he hated Amnon because he had disgraced his sister Tamar.Absalom Kills Amnon"
"9952","2 Samuel","13","23","Two years later, when Absalom’s sheepshearers were at Baal Hazor near the border of Ephraim, he invited all the king’s sons to come there. "
"9953","2 Samuel","13","24","Absalom went to the king and said, “Your servant has had shearers come. Will the king and his attendants please join me?” "
"9954","2 Samuel","13","25","""No, my son,” the king replied. “All of us should not go; we would only be a burden to you.” Although Absalom urged him, he still refused to go but gave him his blessing."
"9955","2 Samuel","13","26","Then Absalom said, “If not, please let my brother Amnon come with us.”The king asked him, “Why should he go with you?” "
"9956","2 Samuel","13","27","But Absalom urged him, so he sent with him Amnon and the rest of the king’s sons."
"9957","2 Samuel","13","28","Absalom ordered his men, “Listen! When Amnon is in high spirits from drinking wine and I say to you, ‘Strike Amnon down,’ then kill him. Don’t be afraid. Haven’t I given you this order? Be strong and brave.” "
"9958","2 Samuel","13","29","So Absalom’s men did to Amnon what Absalom had ordered. Then all the king’s sons got up, mounted their mules and fled."
"9959","2 Samuel","13","30","While they were on their way, the report came to David: “Absalom has struck down all the king’s sons; not one of them is left.” "
"9960","2 Samuel","13","31","The king stood up, tore his clothes and lay down on the ground; and all his attendants stood by with their clothes torn."
"9961","2 Samuel","13","32","But Jonadab son of Shimeah, David’s brother, said, “My lord should not think that they killed all the princes; only Amnon is dead. This has been Absalom’s express intention ever since the day Amnon raped his sister Tamar. "
"9962","2 Samuel","13","33","My lord the king should not be concerned about the report that all the king’s sons are dead. Only Amnon is dead.”"
"9963","2 Samuel","13","34","Meanwhile, Absalom had fled.Now the man standing watch looked up and saw many people on the road west of him, coming down the side of the hill. The watchman went and told the king, “I see men in the direction of Horonaim, on the side of the hill.”13:34 Septuagint; Hebrew does not have this sentence."
"9964","2 Samuel","13","35","Jonadab said to the king, “See, the king’s sons have come; it has happened just as your servant said.”"
"9965","2 Samuel","13","36","As he finished speaking, the king’s sons came in, wailing loudly. The king, too, and all his attendants wept very bitterly."
"9966","2 Samuel","13","37","Absalom fled and went to Talmai son of Ammihud, the king of Geshur. But King David mourned many days for his son."
"9967","2 Samuel","13","38","After Absalom fled and went to Geshur, he stayed there three years. "
"9968","2 Samuel","13","39","And King David longed to go to Absalom, for he was consoled concerning Amnon’s death."
"9969","2 Samuel","14","1","Joab son of Zeruiah knew that the king’s heart longed for Absalom. "
"9970","2 Samuel","14","2","So Joab sent someone to Tekoa and had a wise woman brought from there. He said to her, “Pretend you are in mourning. Dress in mourning clothes, and don’t use any cosmetic lotions. Act like a woman who has spent many days grieving for the dead. "
"9971","2 Samuel","14","3","Then go to the king and speak these words to him.” And Joab put the words in her mouth."
"9972","2 Samuel","14","4","When the woman from Tekoa went14:4 Many Hebrew manuscripts, Septuagint, Vulgate and Syriac; most Hebrew manuscripts spoke to the king, she fell with her face to the ground to pay him honor, and she said, “Help me, Your Majesty!”"
"9973","2 Samuel","14","5","The king asked her, “What is troubling you?”She said, “I am a widow; my husband is dead. "
"9974","2 Samuel","14","6","I your servant had two sons. They got into a fight with each other in the field, and no one was there to separate them. One struck the other and killed him. "
"9975","2 Samuel","14","7","Now the whole clan has risen up against your servant; they say, ‘Hand over the one who struck his brother down, so that we may put him to death for the life of his brother whom he killed; then we will get rid of the heir as well.’ They would put out the only burning coal I have left, leaving my husband neither name nor descendant on the face of the earth.”"
"9976","2 Samuel","14","8","The king said to the woman, “Go home, and I will issue an order in your behalf.”"
"9977","2 Samuel","14","9","But the woman from Tekoa said to him, “Let my lord the king pardon me and my family, and let the king and his throne be without guilt.”"
"9978","2 Samuel","14","10","The king replied, “If anyone says anything to you, bring them to me, and they will not bother you again.”"
"9979","2 Samuel","14","11","She said, “Then let the king invoke the Lord his God to prevent the avenger of blood from adding to the destruction, so that my son will not be destroyed.”“As surely as the Lord lives,” he said, “not one hair of your son’s head will fall to the ground.”"
"9980","2 Samuel","14","12","Then the woman said, “Let your servant speak a word to my lord the king.”“Speak,” he replied."
"9981","2 Samuel","14","13","The woman said, “Why then have you devised a thing like this against the people of God? When the king says this, does he not convict himself, for the king has not brought back his banished son? "
"9982","2 Samuel","14","14","Like water spilled on the ground, which cannot be recovered, so we must die. But that is not what God desires; rather, he devises ways so that a banished person does not remain banished from him. "
"9983","2 Samuel","14","15","""And now I have come to say this to my lord the king because the people have made me afraid. Your servant thought, ‘I will speak to the king; perhaps he will grant his servant’s request. "
"9984","2 Samuel","14","16","Perhaps the king will agree to deliver his servant from the hand of the man who is trying to cut off both me and my son from God’s inheritance.’ "
"9985","2 Samuel","14","17","""And now your servant says, ‘May the word of my lord the king secure my inheritance, for my lord the king is like an angel of God in discerning good and evil. May the Lord your God be with you.’ ”"
"9986","2 Samuel","14","18","Then the king said to the woman, “Don’t keep from me the answer to what I am going to ask you.”“Let my lord the king speak,” the woman said."
"9987","2 Samuel","14","19","The king asked, “Isn’t the hand of Joab with you in all this?”The woman answered, “As surely as you live, my lord the king, no one can turn to the right or to the left from anything my lord the king says. Yes, it was your servant Joab who instructed me to do this and who put all these words into the mouth of your servant. "
"9988","2 Samuel","14","20","Your servant Joab did this to change the present situation. My lord has wisdom like that of an angel of God—he knows everything that happens in the land.”"
"9989","2 Samuel","14","21","The king said to Joab, “Very well, I will do it. Go, bring back the young man Absalom.”"
"9990","2 Samuel","14","22","Joab fell with his face to the ground to pay him honor, and he blessed the king. Joab said, “Today your servant knows that he has found favor in your eyes, my lord the king, because the king has granted his servant’s request.”"
"9991","2 Samuel","14","23","Then Joab went to Geshur and brought Absalom back to Jerusalem. "
"9992","2 Samuel","14","24","But the king said, “He must go to his own house; he must not see my face.” So Absalom went to his own house and did not see the face of the king."
"9993","2 Samuel","14","25","In all Israel there was not a man so highly praised for his handsome appearance as Absalom. From the top of his head to the sole of his foot there was no blemish in him. "
"9994","2 Samuel","14","26","Whenever he cut the hair of his head—he used to cut his hair once a year because it became too heavy for him—he would weigh it, and its weight was two hundred shekels14:26 That is, about 5 pounds or about 2.3 kilograms by the royal standard."
"9995","2 Samuel","14","27","Three sons and a daughter were born to Absalom. His daughter’s name was Tamar, and she became a beautiful woman."
"9996","2 Samuel","14","28","Absalom lived two years in Jerusalem without seeing the king’s face. "
"9997","2 Samuel","14","29","Then Absalom sent for Joab in order to send him to the king, but Joab refused to come to him. So he sent a second time, but he refused to come. "
"9998","2 Samuel","14","30","Then he said to his servants, “Look, Joab’s field is next to mine, and he has barley there. Go and set it on fire.” So Absalom’s servants set the field on fire."
"9999","2 Samuel","14","31","Then Joab did go to Absalom’s house, and he said to him, “Why have your servants set my field on fire?”"
"10000","2 Samuel","14","32","Absalom said to Joab, “Look, I sent word to you and said, ‘Come here so I can send you to the king to ask, “Why have I come from Geshur? It would be better for me if I were still there!” ’ Now then, I want to see the king’s face, and if I am guilty of anything, let him put me to death.”"
"10001","2 Samuel","14","33","So Joab went to the king and told him this. Then the king summoned Absalom, and he came in and bowed down with his face to the ground before the king. And the king kissed Absalom."
"10002","2 Samuel","15","1","In the course of time, Absalom provided himself with a chariot and horses and with fifty men to run ahead of him. "
"10003","2 Samuel","15","2","He would get up early and stand by the side of the road leading to the city gate. Whenever anyone came with a complaint to be placed before the king for a decision, Absalom would call out to him, “What town are you from?” He would answer, “Your servant is from one of the tribes of Israel.” "
"10004","2 Samuel","15","3","Then Absalom would say to him, “Look, your claims are valid and proper, but there is no representative of the king to hear you.” "
"10005","2 Samuel","15","4","And Absalom would add, “If only I were appointed judge in the land! Then everyone who has a complaint or case could come to me and I would see that they receive justice.”"
"10006","2 Samuel","15","5","Also, whenever anyone approached him to bow down before him, Absalom would reach out his hand, take hold of him and kiss him. "
"10007","2 Samuel","15","6","Absalom behaved in this way toward all the Israelites who came to the king asking for justice, and so he stole the hearts of the people of Israel."
"10008","2 Samuel","15","7","At the end of four15:7 Some Septuagint manuscripts, Syriac and Josephus; Hebrew forty years, Absalom said to the king, “Let me go to Hebron and fulfill a vow I made to the Lord. "
"10009","2 Samuel","15","8","While your servant was living at Geshur in Aram, I made this vow: ‘If the Lord takes me back to Jerusalem, I will worship the Lord in Hebron.15:8 Some Septuagint manuscripts; Hebrew does not have in Hebron.’ ”"
"10010","2 Samuel","15","9","The king said to him, “Go in peace.” So he went to Hebron."
"10011","2 Samuel","15","10","Then Absalom sent secret messengers throughout the tribes of Israel to say, “As soon as you hear the sound of the trumpets, then say, ‘Absalom is king in Hebron.’ ” "
"10012","2 Samuel","15","11","Two hundred men from Jerusalem had accompanied Absalom. They had been invited as guests and went quite innocently, knowing nothing about the matter. "
"10013","2 Samuel","15","12","While Absalom was offering sacrifices, he also sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David’s counselor, to come from Giloh, his hometown. And so the conspiracy gained strength, and Absalom’s following kept on increasing.David Flees"
"10014","2 Samuel","15","13","A messenger came and told David, “The hearts of the people of Israel are with Absalom.”"
"10015","2 Samuel","15","14","Then David said to all his officials who were with him in Jerusalem, “Come! We must flee, or none of us will escape from Absalom. We must leave immediately, or he will move quickly to overtake us and bring ruin on us and put the city to the sword.”"
"10016","2 Samuel","15","15","The king’s officials answered him, “Your servants are ready to do whatever our lord the king chooses.”"
"10017","2 Samuel","15","16","The king set out, with his entire household following him; but he left ten concubines to take care of the palace. "
"10018","2 Samuel","15","17","So the king set out, with all the people following him, and they halted at the edge of the city. "
"10019","2 Samuel","15","18","All his men marched past him, along with all the Kerethites and Pelethites; and all the six hundred Gittites who had accompanied him from Gath marched before the king."
"10020","2 Samuel","15","19","The king said to Ittai the Gittite, “Why should you come along with us? Go back and stay with King Absalom. You are a foreigner, an exile from your homeland. "
"10021","2 Samuel","15","20","You came only yesterday. And today shall I make you wander about with us, when I do not know where I am going? Go back, and take your people with you. May the Lord show you kindness and faithfulness.”15:20 Septuagint; Hebrew May kindness and faithfulness be with you"
"10022","2 Samuel","15","21","But Ittai replied to the king, “As surely as the Lord lives, and as my lord the king lives, wherever my lord the king may be, whether it means life or death, there will your servant be.”"
"10023","2 Samuel","15","22","David said to Ittai, “Go ahead, march on.” So Ittai the Gittite marched on with all his men and the families that were with him."
"10024","2 Samuel","15","23","The whole countryside wept aloud as all the people passed by. The king also crossed the Kidron Valley, and all the people moved on toward the wilderness."
"10025","2 Samuel","15","24","Zadok was there, too, and all the Levites who were with him were carrying the ark of the covenant of God. They set down the ark of God, and Abiathar offered sacrifices until all the people had finished leaving the city."
"10026","2 Samuel","15","25","Then the king said to Zadok, “Take the ark of God back into the city. If I find favor in the Lord’s eyes, he will bring me back and let me see it and his dwelling place again. "
"10027","2 Samuel","15","26","But if he says, ‘I am not pleased with you,’ then I am ready; let him do to me whatever seems good to him.”"
"10028","2 Samuel","15","27","The king also said to Zadok the priest, “Do you understand? Go back to the city with my blessing. Take your son Ahimaaz with you, and also Abiathar’s son Jonathan. You and Abiathar return with your two sons. "
"10029","2 Samuel","15","28","I will wait at the fords in the wilderness until word comes from you to inform me.” "
"10030","2 Samuel","15","29","So Zadok and Abiathar took the ark of God back to Jerusalem and stayed there."
"10031","2 Samuel","15","30","But David continued up the Mount of Olives, weeping as he went; his head was covered and he was barefoot. All the people with him covered their heads too and were weeping as they went up. "
"10032","2 Samuel","15","31","Now David had been told, “Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom.” So David prayed, “Lord, turn Ahithophel’s counsel into foolishness.”"
"10033","2 Samuel","15","32","When David arrived at the summit, where people used to worship God, Hushai the Arkite was there to meet him, his robe torn and dust on his head. "
"10034","2 Samuel","15","33","David said to him, “If you go with me, you will be a burden to me. "
"10035","2 Samuel","15","34","But if you return to the city and say to Absalom, ‘Your Majesty, I will be your servant; I was your father’s servant in the past, but now I will be your servant,’ then you can help me by frustrating Ahithophel’s advice. "
"10036","2 Samuel","15","35","Won’t the priests Zadok and Abiathar be there with you? Tell them anything you hear in the king’s palace. "
"10037","2 Samuel","15","36","Their two sons, Ahimaaz son of Zadok and Jonathan son of Abiathar, are there with them. Send them to me with anything you hear.”"
"10038","2 Samuel","15","37","So Hushai, David’s confidant, arrived at Jerusalem as Absalom was entering the city."
"10039","2 Samuel","16","1","When David had gone a short distance beyond the summit, there was Ziba, the steward of Mephibosheth, waiting to meet him. He had a string of donkeys saddled and loaded with two hundred loaves of bread, a hundred cakes of raisins, a hundred cakes of figs and a skin of wine."
"10040","2 Samuel","16","2","The king asked Ziba, “Why have you brought these?”Ziba answered, “The donkeys are for the king’s household to ride on, the bread and fruit are for the men to eat, and the wine is to refresh those who become exhausted in the wilderness.”"
"10041","2 Samuel","16","3","The king then asked, “Where is your master’s grandson?”Ziba said to him, “He is staying in Jerusalem, because he thinks, ‘Today the Israelites will restore to me my grandfather’s kingdom.’ ”"
"10042","2 Samuel","16","4","Then the king said to Ziba, “All that belonged to Mephibosheth is now yours.”“I humbly bow,” Ziba said. “May I find favor in your eyes, my lord the king.”Shimei Curses David"
"10043","2 Samuel","16","5","As King David approached Bahurim, a man from the same clan as Saul’s family came out from there. His name was Shimei son of Gera, and he cursed as he came out. "
"10044","2 Samuel","16","6","He pelted David and all the king’s officials with stones, though all the troops and the special guard were on David’s right and left. "
"10045","2 Samuel","16","7","As he cursed, Shimei said, “Get out, get out, you murderer, you scoundrel! "
"10046","2 Samuel","16","8","The Lord has repaid you for all the blood you shed in the household of Saul, in whose place you have reigned. The Lord has given the kingdom into the hands of your son Absalom. You have come to ruin because you are a murderer!”"
"10047","2 Samuel","16","9","Then Abishai son of Zeruiah said to the king, “Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? Let me go over and cut off his head.”"
"10048","2 Samuel","16","10","But the king said, “What does this have to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah? If he is cursing because the Lord said to him, ‘Curse David,’ who can ask, ‘Why do you do this?’ ”"
"10049","2 Samuel","16","11","David then said to Abishai and all his officials, “My son, my own flesh and blood, is trying to kill me. How much more, then, this Benjamite! Leave him alone; let him curse, for the Lord has told him to. "
"10050","2 Samuel","16","12","It may be that the Lord will look upon my misery and restore to me his covenant blessing instead of his curse today.”"
"10051","2 Samuel","16","13","So David and his men continued along the road while Shimei was going along the hillside opposite him, cursing as he went and throwing stones at him and showering him with dirt. "
"10052","2 Samuel","16","14","The king and all the people with him arrived at their destination exhausted. And there he refreshed himself.The Advice of Ahithophel and Hushai"
"10053","2 Samuel","16","15","Meanwhile, Absalom and all the men of Israel came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel was with him. "
"10054","2 Samuel","16","16","Then Hushai the Arkite, David’s confidant, went to Absalom and said to him, “Long live the king! Long live the king!”"
"10055","2 Samuel","16","17","Absalom said to Hushai, “So this is the love you show your friend? If he’s your friend, why didn’t you go with him?”"
"10056","2 Samuel","16","18","Hushai said to Absalom, “No, the one chosen by the Lord, by these people, and by all the men of Israel—his I will be, and I will remain with him. "
"10057","2 Samuel","16","19","Furthermore, whom should I serve? Should I not serve the son? Just as I served your father, so I will serve you.”"
"10058","2 Samuel","16","20","Absalom said to Ahithophel, “Give us your advice. What should we do?”"
"10059","2 Samuel","16","21","Ahithophel answered, “Sleep with your father’s concubines whom he left to take care of the palace. Then all Israel will hear that you have made yourself obnoxious to your father, and the hands of everyone with you will be more resolute.” "
"10060","2 Samuel","16","22","So they pitched a tent for Absalom on the roof, and he slept with his father’s concubines in the sight of all Israel."
"10061","2 Samuel","16","23","Now in those days the advice Ahithophel gave was like that of one who inquires of God. That was how both David and Absalom regarded all of Ahithophel’s advice."
"10062","2 Samuel","17","1","Ahithophel said to Absalom, “I would17:1 Or Let me choose twelve thousand men and set out tonight in pursuit of David. "
"10063","2 Samuel","17","2","I would attack him while he is weary and weak. I would strike him with terror, and then all the people with him will flee. I would strike down only the king "
"10064","2 Samuel","17","3","and bring all the people back to you. The death of the man you seek will mean the return of all; all the people will be unharmed.” "
"10065","2 Samuel","17","4","This plan seemed good to Absalom and to all the elders of Israel."
"10066","2 Samuel","17","5","But Absalom said, “Summon also Hushai the Arkite, so we can hear what he has to say as well.” "
"10067","2 Samuel","17","6","When Hushai came to him, Absalom said, “Ahithophel has given this advice. Should we do what he says? If not, give us your opinion.”"
"10068","2 Samuel","17","7","Hushai replied to Absalom, “The advice Ahithophel has given is not good this time. "
"10069","2 Samuel","17","8","You know your father and his men; they are fighters, and as fierce as a wild bear robbed of her cubs. Besides, your father is an experienced fighter; he will not spend the night with the troops. "
"10070","2 Samuel","17","9","Even now, he is hidden in a cave or some other place. If he should attack your troops first,17:9 Or When some of the men fall at the first attack whoever hears about it will say, ‘There has been a slaughter among the troops who follow Absalom.’ "
"10071","2 Samuel","17","10","Then even the bravest soldier, whose heart is like the heart of a lion, will melt with fear, for all Israel knows that your father is a fighter and that those with him are brave. "
"10072","2 Samuel","17","11","""So I advise you: Let all Israel, from Dan to Beersheba—as numerous as the sand on the seashore—be gathered to you, with you yourself leading them into battle. "
"10073","2 Samuel","17","12","Then we will attack him wherever he may be found, and we will fall on him as dew settles on the ground. Neither he nor any of his men will be left alive. "
"10074","2 Samuel","17","13","If he withdraws into a city, then all Israel will bring ropes to that city, and we will drag it down to the valley until not so much as a pebble is left.”"
"10075","2 Samuel","17","14","Absalom and all the men of Israel said, “The advice of Hushai the Arkite is better than that of Ahithophel.” For the Lord had determined to frustrate the good advice of Ahithophel in order to bring disaster on Absalom."
"10076","2 Samuel","17","15","Hushai told Zadok and Abiathar, the priests, “Ahithophel has advised Absalom and the elders of Israel to do such and such, but I have advised them to do so and so. "
"10077","2 Samuel","17","16","Now send a message at once and tell David, ‘Do not spend the night at the fords in the wilderness; cross over without fail, or the king and all the people with him will be swallowed up.’ ”"
"10078","2 Samuel","17","17","Jonathan and Ahimaaz were staying at En Rogel. A female servant was to go and inform them, and they were to go and tell King David, for they could not risk being seen entering the city. "
"10079","2 Samuel","17","18","But a young man saw them and told Absalom. So the two of them left at once and went to the house of a man in Bahurim. He had a well in his courtyard, and they climbed down into it. "
"10080","2 Samuel","17","19","His wife took a covering and spread it out over the opening of the well and scattered grain over it. No one knew anything about it."
"10081","2 Samuel","17","20","When Absalom’s men came to the woman at the house, they asked, “Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan?”The woman answered them, “They crossed over the brook.”17:20 Or “They passed by the sheep pen toward the water.” The men searched but found no one, so they returned to Jerusalem."
"10082","2 Samuel","17","21","After they had gone, the two climbed out of the well and went to inform King David. They said to him, “Set out and cross the river at once; Ahithophel has advised such and such against you.” "
"10083","2 Samuel","17","22","So David and all the people with him set out and crossed the Jordan. By daybreak, no one was left who had not crossed the Jordan."
"10084","2 Samuel","17","23","When Ahithophel saw that his advice had not been followed, he saddled his donkey and set out for his house in his hometown. He put his house in order and then hanged himself. So he died and was buried in his father’s tomb.Absalom’s Death"
"10085","2 Samuel","17","24","David went to Mahanaim, and Absalom crossed the Jordan with all the men of Israel. "
"10086","2 Samuel","17","25","Absalom had appointed Amasa over the army in place of Joab. Amasa was the son of Jether,17:25 Hebrew Ithra, a variant of Jether an Ishmaelite17:25 Some Septuagint manuscripts (see also 1 Chron. 2:17); Hebrew and other Septuagint manuscripts Israelite who had married Abigail,17:25 Hebrew Abigal, a variant of Abigail the daughter of Nahash and sister of Zeruiah the mother of Joab. "
"10087","2 Samuel","17","26","The Israelites and Absalom camped in the land of Gilead."
"10088","2 Samuel","17","27","When David came to Mahanaim, Shobi son of Nahash from Rabbah of the Ammonites, and Makir son of Ammiel from Lo Debar, and Barzillai the Gileadite from Rogelim "
"10089","2 Samuel","17","28","brought bedding and bowls and articles of pottery. They also brought wheat and barley, flour and roasted grain, beans and lentils,17:28 Most Septuagint manuscripts and Syriac; Hebrew lentils, and roasted grain "
"10090","2 Samuel","17","29","honey and curds, sheep, and cheese from cows’ milk for David and his people to eat. For they said, “The people have become exhausted and hungry and thirsty in the wilderness.”"
"10091","2 Samuel","18","1","David mustered the men who were with him and appointed over them commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds. "
"10092","2 Samuel","18","2","David sent out his troops, a third under the command of Joab, a third under Joab’s brother Abishai son of Zeruiah, and a third under Ittai the Gittite. The king told the troops, “I myself will surely march out with you.”"
"10093","2 Samuel","18","3","But the men said, “You must not go out; if we are forced to flee, they won’t care about us. Even if half of us die, they won’t care; but you are worth ten thousand of us.18:3 Two Hebrew manuscripts, some Septuagint manuscripts and Vulgate; most Hebrew manuscripts care; for now there are ten thousand like us It would be better now for you to give us support from the city.”"
"10094","2 Samuel","18","4","The king answered, “I will do whatever seems best to you.”So the king stood beside the gate while all his men marched out in units of hundreds and of thousands. "
"10095","2 Samuel","18","5","The king commanded Joab, Abishai and Ittai, “Be gentle with the young man Absalom for my sake.” And all the troops heard the king giving orders concerning Absalom to each of the commanders."
"10096","2 Samuel","18","6","David’s army marched out of the city to fight Israel, and the battle took place in the forest of Ephraim. "
"10097","2 Samuel","18","7","There Israel’s troops were routed by David’s men, and the casualties that day were great—twenty thousand men. "
"10098","2 Samuel","18","8","The battle spread out over the whole countryside, and the forest swallowed up more men that day than the sword."
"10099","2 Samuel","18","9","Now Absalom happened to meet David’s men. He was riding his mule, and as the mule went under the thick branches of a large oak, Absalom’s hair got caught in the tree. He was left hanging in midair, while the mule he was riding kept on going."
"10100","2 Samuel","18","10","When one of the men saw what had happened, he told Joab, “I just saw Absalom hanging in an oak tree.”"
"10101","2 Samuel","18","11","Joab said to the man who had told him this, “What! You saw him? Why didn’t you strike him to the ground right there? Then I would have had to give you ten shekels18:11 That is, about 4 ounces or about 115 grams of silver and a warrior’s belt.”"
"10102","2 Samuel","18","12","But the man replied, “Even if a thousand shekels18:12 That is, about 25 pounds or about 12 kilograms were weighed out into my hands, I would not lay a hand on the king’s son. In our hearing the king commanded you and Abishai and Ittai, ‘Protect the young man Absalom for my sake.18:12 A few Hebrew manuscripts, Septuagint, Vulgate and Syriac; most Hebrew manuscripts may be translated Absalom, whoever you may be.’ "
"10103","2 Samuel","18","13","And if I had put my life in jeopardy18:13 Or Otherwise, if I had acted treacherously toward him—and nothing is hidden from the king—you would have kept your distance from me.”"
"10104","2 Samuel","18","14","Joab said, “I’m not going to wait like this for you.” So he took three javelins in his hand and plunged them into Absalom’s heart while Absalom was still alive in the oak tree. "
"10105","2 Samuel","18","15","And ten of Joab’s armor-bearers surrounded Absalom, struck him and killed him."
"10106","2 Samuel","18","16","Then Joab sounded the trumpet, and the troops stopped pursuing Israel, for Joab halted them. "
"10107","2 Samuel","18","17","They took Absalom, threw him into a big pit in the forest and piled up a large heap of rocks over him. Meanwhile, all the Israelites fled to their homes."
"10108","2 Samuel","18","18","During his lifetime Absalom had taken a pillar and erected it in the King’s Valley as a monument to himself, for he thought, “I have no son to carry on the memory of my name.” He named the pillar after himself, and it is called Absalom’s Monument to this day.David Mourns"
"10109","2 Samuel","18","19","Now Ahimaaz son of Zadok said, “Let me run and take the news to the king that the Lord has vindicated him by delivering him from the hand of his enemies.” "
"10110","2 Samuel","18","20","""You are not the one to take the news today,” Joab told him. “You may take the news another time, but you must not do so today, because the king’s son is dead.”"
"10111","2 Samuel","18","21","Then Joab said to a Cushite, “Go, tell the king what you have seen.” The Cushite bowed down before Joab and ran off."
"10112","2 Samuel","18","22","Ahimaaz son of Zadok again said to Joab, “Come what may, please let me run behind the Cushite.”But Joab replied, “My son, why do you want to go? You don’t have any news that will bring you a reward.”"
"10113","2 Samuel","18","23","He said, “Come what may, I want to run.”So Joab said, “Run!” Then Ahimaaz ran by way of the plain18:23 That is, the plain of the Jordan and outran the Cushite."
"10114","2 Samuel","18","24","While David was sitting between the inner and outer gates, the watchman went up to the roof of the gateway by the wall. As he looked out, he saw a man running alone. "
"10115","2 Samuel","18","25","The watchman called out to the king and reported it.The king said, “If he is alone, he must have good news.” And the runner came closer and closer."
"10116","2 Samuel","18","26","Then the watchman saw another runner, and he called down to the gatekeeper, “Look, another man running alone!”The king said, “He must be bringing good news, too.”"
"10117","2 Samuel","18","27","The watchman said, “It seems to me that the first one runs like Ahimaaz son of Zadok.”“He’s a good man,” the king said. “He comes with good news.”"
"10118","2 Samuel","18","28","Then Ahimaaz called out to the king, “All is well!” He bowed down before the king with his face to the ground and said, “Praise be to the Lord your God! He has delivered up those who lifted their hands against my lord the king.”"
"10119","2 Samuel","18","29","The king asked, “Is the young man Absalom safe?”Ahimaaz answered, “I saw great confusion just as Joab was about to send the king’s servant and me, your servant, but I don’t know what it was.”"
"10120","2 Samuel","18","30","The king said, “Stand aside and wait here.” So he stepped aside and stood there."
"10121","2 Samuel","18","31","Then the Cushite arrived and said, “My lord the king, hear the good news! The Lord has vindicated you today by delivering you from the hand of all who rose up against you.”"
"10122","2 Samuel","18","32","The king asked the Cushite, “Is the young man Absalom safe?”The Cushite replied, “May the enemies of my lord the king and all who rise up to harm you be like that young man.”"
"10123","2 Samuel","18","33","The king was shaken. He went up to the room over the gateway and wept. As he went, he said: “O my son Absalom! My son, my son Absalom! If only I had died instead of you—O Absalom, my son, my son!”18:33 In Hebrew texts this verse (18:33) is numbered 19:1."
"10124","2 Samuel","19","1","Joab was told, “The king is weeping and mourning for Absalom.” "
"10125","2 Samuel","19","2","And for the whole army the victory that day was turned into mourning, because on that day the troops heard it said, “The king is grieving for his son.” "
"10126","2 Samuel","19","3","The men stole into the city that day as men steal in who are ashamed when they flee from battle. "
"10127","2 Samuel","19","4","The king covered his face and cried aloud, “O my son Absalom! O Absalom, my son, my son!”"
"10128","2 Samuel","19","5","Then Joab went into the house to the king and said, “Today you have humiliated all your men, who have just saved your life and the lives of your sons and daughters and the lives of your wives and concubines. "

"10130","2 Samuel","19","7","Now go out and encourage your men. I swear by the Lord that if you don’t go out, not a man will be left with you by nightfall. This will be worse for you than all the calamities that have come on you from your youth till now.”"

"10133","2 Samuel","19","10","and Absalom, whom we anointed to rule over us, has died in battle. So why do you say nothing about bringing the king back?”"
"10134","2 Samuel","19","11","King David sent this message to Zadok and Abiathar, the priests: “Ask the elders of Judah, ‘Why should you be the last to bring the king back to his palace, since what is being said throughout Israel has reached the king at his quarters? "
"10135","2 Samuel","19","12","You are my relatives, my own flesh and blood. So why should you be the last to bring back the king?’ "
"10136","2 Samuel","19","13","And say to Amasa, ‘Are you not my own flesh and blood? May God deal with me, be it ever so severely, if you are not the commander of my army for life in place of Joab.’ ”"
"10137","2 Samuel","19","14","He won over the hearts of the men of Judah so that they were all of one mind. They sent word to the king, “Return, you and all your men.” "
"10138","2 Samuel","19","15","Then the king returned and went as far as the Jordan.Now the men of Judah had come to Gilgal to go out and meet the king and bring him across the Jordan. "
"10139","2 Samuel","19","16","Shimei son of Gera, the Benjamite from Bahurim, hurried down with the men of Judah to meet King David. "
"10140","2 Samuel","19","17","With him were a thousand Benjamites, along with Ziba, the steward of Saul’s household, and his fifteen sons and twenty servants. They rushed to the Jordan, where the king was. "
"10141","2 Samuel","19","18","They crossed at the ford to take the king’s household over and to do whatever he wished.When Shimei son of Gera crossed the Jordan, he fell prostrate before the king "
"10142","2 Samuel","19","19","and said to him, “May my lord not hold me guilty. Do not remember how your servant did wrong on the day my lord the king left Jerusalem. May the king put it out of his mind. "
"10143","2 Samuel","19","20","For I your servant know that I have sinned, but today I have come here as the first from the tribes of Joseph to come down and meet my lord the king.”"
"10144","2 Samuel","19","21","Then Abishai son of Zeruiah said, “Shouldn’t Shimei be put to death for this? He cursed the Lord’s anointed.”"
"10145","2 Samuel","19","22","David replied, “What does this have to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah? What right do you have to interfere? Should anyone be put to death in Israel today? Don’t I know that today I am king over Israel?” "
"10146","2 Samuel","19","23","So the king said to Shimei, “You shall not die.” And the king promised him on oath."
"10147","2 Samuel","19","24","Mephibosheth, Saul’s grandson, also went down to meet the king. He had not taken care of his feet or trimmed his mustache or washed his clothes from the day the king left until the day he returned safely. "
"10148","2 Samuel","19","25","When he came from Jerusalem to meet the king, the king asked him, “Why didn’t you go with me, Mephibosheth?”"
"10149","2 Samuel","19","26","He said, “My lord the king, since I your servant am lame, I said, ‘I will have my donkey saddled and will ride on it, so I can go with the king.’ But Ziba my servant betrayed me. "
"10150","2 Samuel","19","27","And he has slandered your servant to my lord the king. My lord the king is like an angel of God; so do whatever you wish. "
"10151","2 Samuel","19","28","All my grandfather’s descendants deserved nothing but death from my lord the king, but you gave your servant a place among those who eat at your table. So what right do I have to make any more appeals to the king?”"
"10152","2 Samuel","19","29","The king said to him, “Why say more? I order you and Ziba to divide the land.”"
"10153","2 Samuel","19","30","Mephibosheth said to the king, “Let him take everything, now that my lord the king has returned home safely.”"
"10154","2 Samuel","19","31","Barzillai the Gileadite also came down from Rogelim to cross the Jordan with the king and to send him on his way from there. "
"10155","2 Samuel","19","32","Now Barzillai was very old, eighty years of age. He had provided for the king during his stay in Mahanaim, for he was a very wealthy man. "
"10156","2 Samuel","19","33","The king said to Barzillai, “Cross over with me and stay with me in Jerusalem, and I will provide for you.”"
"10157","2 Samuel","19","34","But Barzillai answered the king, “How many more years will I live, that I should go up to Jerusalem with the king? "
"10158","2 Samuel","19","35","I am now eighty years old. Can I tell the difference between what is enjoyable and what is not? Can your servant taste what he eats and drinks? Can I still hear the voices of male and female singers? Why should your servant be an added burden to my lord the king? "
"10159","2 Samuel","19","36","Your servant will cross over the Jordan with the king for a short distance, but why should the king reward me in this way? "
"10160","2 Samuel","19","37","Let your servant return, that I may die in my own town near the tomb of my father and mother. But here is your servant Kimham. Let him cross over with my lord the king. Do for him whatever you wish.”"
"10161","2 Samuel","19","38","The king said, “Kimham shall cross over with me, and I will do for him whatever you wish. And anything you desire from me I will do for you.”"
"10162","2 Samuel","19","39","So all the people crossed the Jordan, and then the king crossed over. The king kissed Barzillai and bid him farewell, and Barzillai returned to his home."
"10163","2 Samuel","19","40","When the king crossed over to Gilgal, Kimham crossed with him. All the troops of Judah and half the troops of Israel had taken the king over."
"10164","2 Samuel","19","41","Soon all the men of Israel were coming to the king and saying to him, “Why did our brothers, the men of Judah, steal the king away and bring him and his household across the Jordan, together with all his men?”"
"10165","2 Samuel","19","42","All the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, “We did this because the king is closely related to us. Why are you angry about it? Have we eaten any of the king’s provisions? Have we taken anything for ourselves?”"
"10166","2 Samuel","19","43","Then the men of Israel answered the men of Judah, “We have ten shares in the king; so we have a greater claim on David than you have. Why then do you treat us with contempt? Weren’t we the first to speak of bringing back our king?”But the men of Judah pressed their claims even more forcefully than the men of Israel."
"10167","2 Samuel","20","1","Now a troublemaker named Sheba son of Bikri, a Benjamite, happened to be there. He sounded the trumpet and shouted,“We have no share in David,no part in Jesse’s son!Every man to his tent, Israel!”"
"10168","2 Samuel","20","2","So all the men of Israel deserted David to follow Sheba son of Bikri. But the men of Judah stayed by their king all the way from the Jordan to Jerusalem."
"10169","2 Samuel","20","3","When David returned to his palace in Jerusalem, he took the ten concubines he had left to take care of the palace and put them in a house under guard. He provided for them but had no sexual relations with them. They were kept in confinement till the day of their death, living as widows."
"10170","2 Samuel","20","4","Then the king said to Amasa, “Summon the men of Judah to come to me within three days, and be here yourself.” "
"10171","2 Samuel","20","5","But when Amasa went to summon Judah, he took longer than the time the king had set for him."
"10172","2 Samuel","20","6","David said to Abishai, “Now Sheba son of Bikri will do us more harm than Absalom did. Take your master’s men and pursue him, or he will find fortified cities and escape from us.”20:6 Or and do us serious injury "
"10173","2 Samuel","20","7","So Joab’s men and the Kerethites and Pelethites and all the mighty warriors went out under the command of Abishai. They marched out from Jerusalem to pursue Sheba son of Bikri."
"10174","2 Samuel","20","8","While they were at the great rock in Gibeon, Amasa came to meet them. Joab was wearing his military tunic, and strapped over it at his waist was a belt with a dagger in its sheath. As he stepped forward, it dropped out of its sheath."
"10175","2 Samuel","20","9","Joab said to Amasa, “How are you, my brother?” Then Joab took Amasa by the beard with his right hand to kiss him. "
"10176","2 Samuel","20","10","Amasa was not on his guard against the dagger in Joab’s hand, and Joab plunged it into his belly, and his intestines spilled out on the ground. Without being stabbed again, Amasa died. Then Joab and his brother Abishai pursued Sheba son of Bikri."
"10177","2 Samuel","20","11","One of Joab’s men stood beside Amasa and said, “Whoever favors Joab, and whoever is for David, let him follow Joab!” "
"10178","2 Samuel","20","12","Amasa lay wallowing in his blood in the middle of the road, and the man saw that all the troops came to a halt there. When he realized that everyone who came up to Amasa stopped, he dragged him from the road into a field and threw a garment over him. "
"10179","2 Samuel","20","13","After Amasa had been removed from the road, everyone went on with Joab to pursue Sheba son of Bikri."
"10180","2 Samuel","20","14","Sheba passed through all the tribes of Israel to Abel Beth Maakah and through the entire region of the Bikrites,20:14 See Septuagint and Vulgate; Hebrew Berites. who gathered together and followed him. "
"10181","2 Samuel","20","15","All the troops with Joab came and besieged Sheba in Abel Beth Maakah. They built a siege ramp up to the city, and it stood against the outer fortifications. While they were battering the wall to bring it down, "
"10182","2 Samuel","20","16","a wise woman called from the city, “Listen! Listen! Tell Joab to come here so I can speak to him.” "
"10183","2 Samuel","20","17","He went toward her, and she asked, “Are you Joab?”“I am,” he answered.She said, “Listen to what your servant has to say.”“I’m listening,” he said."
"10184","2 Samuel","20","18","She continued, “Long ago they used to say, ‘Get your answer at Abel,’ and that settled it. "
"10185","2 Samuel","20","19","We are the peaceful and faithful in Israel. You are trying to destroy a city that is a mother in Israel. Why do you want to swallow up the Lord’s inheritance?” "
"10186","2 Samuel","20","20","""Far be it from me!” Joab replied, “Far be it from me to swallow up or destroy! "
"10187","2 Samuel","20","21","That is not the case. A man named Sheba son of Bikri, from the hill country of Ephraim, has lifted up his hand against the king, against David. Hand over this one man, and I’ll withdraw from the city.”The woman said to Joab, “His head will be thrown to you from the wall.”"
"10188","2 Samuel","20","22","Then the woman went to all the people with her wise advice, and they cut off the head of Sheba son of Bikri and threw it to Joab. So he sounded the trumpet, and his men dispersed from the city, each returning to his home. And Joab went back to the king in Jerusalem.David’s Officials"

"10194","2 Samuel","21","2","The king summoned the Gibeonites and spoke to them. (Now the Gibeonites were not a part of Israel but were survivors of the Amorites; the Israelites had sworn to spare them, but Saul in his zeal for Israel and Judah had tried to annihilate them.) "

"10281","2 Samuel","23","16","So the three mighty warriors broke through the Philistine lines, drew water from the well near the gate of Bethlehem and carried it back to David. But he refused to drink it; instead, he poured it out before the Lord.  "
"10282","2 Samuel","23","17","""Far be it from me, Lord, to do this!” he said. “Is it not the blood of men who went at the risk of their lives?” And David would not drink it.Such were the exploits of the three mighty warriors."
"10283","2 Samuel","23","18","Abishai the brother of Joab son of Zeruiah was chief of the Three.23:18 Most Hebrew manuscripts (see also 1 Chron. 11:20); two Hebrew manuscripts and Syriac Thirty He raised his spear against three hundred men, whom he killed, and so he became as famous as the Three. "
"10284","2 Samuel","23","19","Was he not held in greater honor than the Three? He became their commander, even though he was not included among them."
"10285","2 Samuel","23","20","Benaiah son of Jehoiada, a valiant fighter from Kabzeel, performed great exploits. He struck down Moab’s two mightiest warriors. He also went down into a pit on a snowy day and killed a lion. "
"10286","2 Samuel","23","21","And he struck down a huge Egyptian. Although the Egyptian had a spear in his hand, Benaiah went against him with a club. He snatched the spear from the Egyptian’s hand and killed him with his own spear. "
"10287","2 Samuel","23","22","Such were the exploits of Benaiah son of Jehoiada; he too was as famous as the three mighty warriors. "
"10288","2 Samuel","23","23","He was held in greater honor than any of the Thirty, but he was not included among the Three. And David put him in charge of his bodyguard."

"10305","2 Samuel","24","1","Again the anger of the Lord burned against Israel, and he incited David against them, saying, “Go and take a census of Israel and Judah.”"
"10306","2 Samuel","24","2","So the king said to Joab and the army commanders24:2 Septuagint (see also verse 4 and 1 Chron. 21:2); Hebrew Joab the army commander with him, “Go throughout the tribes of Israel from Dan to Beersheba and enroll the fighting men, so that I may know how many there are.”"
"10307","2 Samuel","24","3","But Joab replied to the king, “May the Lord your God multiply the troops a hundred times over, and may the eyes of my lord the king see it. But why does my lord the king want to do such a thing?”"
"10308","2 Samuel","24","4","The king’s word, however, overruled Joab and the army commanders; so they left the presence of the king to enroll the fighting men of Israel."
"10309","2 Samuel","24","5","After crossing the Jordan, they camped near Aroer, south of the town in the gorge, and then went through Gad and on to Jazer. "
"10310","2 Samuel","24","6","They went to Gilead and the region of Tahtim Hodshi, and on to Dan Jaan and around toward Sidon. "
"10311","2 Samuel","24","7","Then they went toward the fortress of Tyre and all the towns of the Hivites and Canaanites. Finally, they went on to Beersheba in the Negev of Judah."
"10312","2 Samuel","24","8","After they had gone through the entire land, they came back to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days."
"10313","2 Samuel","24","9","Joab reported the number of the fighting men to the king: In Israel there were eight hundred thousand able-bodied men who could handle a sword, and in Judah five hundred thousand."
"10314","2 Samuel","24","10","David was conscience-stricken after he had counted the fighting men, and he said to the Lord, “I have sinned greatly in what I have done. Now, Lord, I beg you, take away the guilt of your servant. I have done a very foolish thing.”"
"10315","2 Samuel","24","11","Before David got up the next morning, the word of the Lord had come to Gad the prophet, David’s seer:  "
"10316","2 Samuel","24","12","""Go and tell David, ‘This is what the Lord says: I am giving you three options. Choose one of them for me to carry out against you.’ ”"
"10317","2 Samuel","24","13","So Gad went to David and said to him, “Shall there come on you three24:13 Septuagint (see also 1 Chron. 21:12); Hebrew seven years of famine in your land? Or three months of fleeing from your enemies while they pursue you? Or three days of plague in your land? Now then, think it over and decide how I should answer the one who sent me.”"
"10318","2 Samuel","24","14","David said to Gad, “I am in deep distress. Let us fall into the hands of the Lord, for his mercy is great; but do not let me fall into human hands.”"
"10319","2 Samuel","24","15","So the Lord sent a plague on Israel from that morning until the end of the time designated, and seventy thousand of the people from Dan to Beersheba died. "
"10320","2 Samuel","24","16","When the angel stretched out his hand to destroy Jerusalem, the Lord relented concerning the disaster and said to the angel who was afflicting the people, “Enough! Withdraw your hand.” The angel of the Lord was then at the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite."
"10321","2 Samuel","24","17","When David saw the angel who was striking down the people, he said to the Lord, “I have sinned; I, the shepherd,24:17 Dead Sea Scrolls and Septuagint; Masoretic Text does not have the shepherd. have done wrong. These are but sheep. What have they done? Let your hand fall on me and my family.”David Builds an Altar"
"10322","2 Samuel","24","18","On that day Gad went to David and said to him, “Go up and build an altar to the Lord on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.” "
"10323","2 Samuel","24","19","So David went up, as the Lord had commanded through Gad. "
"10324","2 Samuel","24","20","When Araunah looked and saw the king and his officials coming toward him, he went out and bowed down before the king with his face to the ground."
"10325","2 Samuel","24","21","Araunah said, “Why has my lord the king come to his servant?”“To buy your threshing floor,” David answered, “so I can build an altar to the Lord, that the plague on the people may be stopped.”"
"10326","2 Samuel","24","22","Araunah said to David, “Let my lord the king take whatever he wishes and offer it up. Here are oxen for the burnt offering, and here are threshing sledges and ox yokes for the wood. "
"10327","2 Samuel","24","23","Your Majesty, Araunah24:23 Some Hebrew manuscripts and Septuagint; most Hebrew manuscripts King Araunah gives all this to the king.” Araunah also said to him, “May the Lord your God accept you.”"
"10328","2 Samuel","24","24","But the king replied to Araunah, “No, I insist on paying you for it. I will not sacrifice to the Lord my God burnt offerings that cost me nothing.”So David bought the threshing floor and the oxen and paid fifty shekels24:24 That is, about 1 1/4 pounds or about 575 grams of silver for them. "
"10329","2 Samuel","24","25","David built an altar to the Lord there and sacrificed burnt offerings and fellowship offerings. Then the Lord answered his prayer in behalf of the land, and the plague on Israel was stopped."
"10330","1 Kings","1","1","When King David was very old, he could not keep warm even when they put covers over him. "
"10331","1 Kings","1","2","So his attendants said to him, “Let us look for a young virgin to serve the king and take care of him. She can lie beside him so that our lord the king may keep warm.”"
"10332","1 Kings","1","3","Then they searched throughout Israel for a beautiful young woman and found Abishag, a Shunammite, and brought her to the king. "
"10333","1 Kings","1","4","The woman was very beautiful; she took care of the king and waited on him, but the king had no sexual relations with her."
"10334","1 Kings","1","5","Now Adonijah, whose mother was Haggith, put himself forward and said, “I will be king.” So he got chariots and horses1:5 Or charioteers ready, with fifty men to run ahead of him. 6(His father had never rebuked him by asking, “Why do you behave as you do?” He was also very handsome and was born next after Absalom.)"
"10335","1 Kings","1","7","Adonijah conferred with Joab son of Zeruiah and with Abiathar the priest, and they gave him their support. "
"10336","1 Kings","1","8","But Zadok the priest, Benaiah son of Jehoiada, Nathan the prophet, Shimei and Rei and David’s special guard did not join Adonijah."
"10337","1 Kings","1","9","Adonijah then sacrificed sheep, cattle and fattened calves at the Stone of Zoheleth near En Rogel. He invited all his brothers, the king’s sons, and all the royal officials of Judah, "
"10338","1 Kings","1","10","but he did not invite Nathan the prophet or Benaiah or the special guard or his brother Solomon."
"10339","1 Kings","1","11","Then Nathan asked Bathsheba, Solomon’s mother, “Have you not heard that Adonijah, the son of Haggith, has become king, and our lord David knows nothing about it? "
"10340","1 Kings","1","12","Now then, let me advise you how you can save your own life and the life of your son Solomon. "
"10341","1 Kings","1","13","Go in to King David and say to him, ‘My lord the king, did you not swear to me your servant: “Surely Solomon your son shall be king after me, and he will sit on my throne”? Why then has Adonijah become king?’ "
"10342","1 Kings","1","14","While you are still there talking to the king, I will come in and add my word to what you have said.”"
"10343","1 Kings","1","15","So Bathsheba went to see the aged king in his room, where Abishag the Shunammite was attending him. "
"10344","1 Kings","1","16","Bathsheba bowed down, prostrating herself before the king.“What is it you want?” the king asked."
"10345","1 Kings","1","17","She said to him, “My lord, you yourself swore to me your servant by the Lord your God: ‘Solomon your son shall be king after me, and he will sit on my throne.’ "
"10346","1 Kings","1","18","But now Adonijah has become king, and you, my lord the king, do not know about it. "
"10347","1 Kings","1","19","He has sacrificed great numbers of cattle, fattened calves, and sheep, and has invited all the king’s sons, Abiathar the priest and Joab the commander of the army, but he has not invited Solomon your servant. "
"10348","1 Kings","1","20","My lord the king, the eyes of all Israel are on you, to learn from you who will sit on the throne of my lord the king after him. "
"10349","1 Kings","1","21","Otherwise, as soon as my lord the king is laid to rest with his ancestors, I and my son Solomon will be treated as criminals.”"
"10350","1 Kings","1","22","While she was still speaking with the king, Nathan the prophet arrived. "
"10351","1 Kings","1","23","And the king was told, “Nathan the prophet is here.” So he went before the king and bowed with his face to the ground."
"10352","1 Kings","1","24","Nathan said, “Have you, my lord the king, declared that Adonijah shall be king after you, and that he will sit on your throne? "
"10353","1 Kings","1","25","Today he has gone down and sacrificed great numbers of cattle, fattened calves, and sheep. He has invited all the king’s sons, the commanders of the army and Abiathar the priest. Right now they are eating and drinking with him and saying, ‘Long live King Adonijah!’ "
"10354","1 Kings","1","26","But me your servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah son of Jehoiada, and your servant Solomon he did not invite. "
"10355","1 Kings","1","27","Is this something my lord the king has done without letting his servants know who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?”David Makes Solomon King"
"10356","1 Kings","1","28","Then King David said, “Call in Bathsheba.” So she came into the king’s presence and stood before him."
"10357","1 Kings","1","29","The king then took an oath: “As surely as the Lord lives, who has delivered me out of every trouble, "
"10358","1 Kings","1","30","I will surely carry out this very day what I swore to you by the Lord, the God of Israel: Solomon your son shall be king after me, and he will sit on my throne in my place.”"
"10359","1 Kings","1","31","Then Bathsheba bowed down with her face to the ground, prostrating herself before the king, and said, “May my lord King David live forever!”"
"10360","1 Kings","1","32","King David said, “Call in Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet and Benaiah son of Jehoiada.” When they came before the king, "
"10361","1 Kings","1","33","he said to them: “Take your lord’s servants with you and have Solomon my son mount my own mule and take him down to Gihon. "
"10362","1 Kings","1","34","There have Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him king over Israel. Blow the trumpet and shout, ‘Long live King Solomon!’ "
"10363","1 Kings","1","35","Then you are to go up with him, and he is to come and sit on my throne and reign in my place. I have appointed him ruler over Israel and Judah.”"
"10364","1 Kings","1","36","Benaiah son of Jehoiada answered the king, “Amen! May the Lord, the God of my lord the king, so declare it. "
"10365","1 Kings","1","37","As the Lord was with my lord the king, so may he be with Solomon to make his throne even greater than the throne of my lord King David!”"
"10366","1 Kings","1","38","So Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah son of Jehoiada, the Kerethites and the Pelethites went down and had Solomon mount King David’s mule, and they escorted him to Gihon. "
"10367","1 Kings","1","39","Zadok the priest took the horn of oil from the sacred tent and anointed Solomon. Then they sounded the trumpet and all the people shouted, “Long live King Solomon!” "
"10368","1 Kings","1","40","And all the people went up after him, playing pipes and rejoicing greatly, so that the ground shook with the sound."
"10369","1 Kings","1","41","Adonijah and all the guests who were with him heard it as they were finishing their feast. On hearing the sound of the trumpet, Joab asked, “What’s the meaning of all the noise in the city?”"
"10370","1 Kings","1","42","Even as he was speaking, Jonathan son of Abiathar the priest arrived. Adonijah said, “Come in. A worthy man like you must be bringing good news.” "
"10371","1 Kings","1","43","""Not at all!” Jonathan answered. “Our lord King David has made Solomon king. "
"10372","1 Kings","1","44","The king has sent with him Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah son of Jehoiada, the Kerethites and the Pelethites, and they have put him on the king’s mule, "
"10373","1 Kings","1","45","and Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king at Gihon. From there they have gone up cheering, and the city resounds with it. That’s the noise you hear. "
"10374","1 Kings","1","46","Moreover, Solomon has taken his seat on the royal throne. "
"10375","1 Kings","1","47","Also, the royal officials have come to congratulate our lord King David, saying, ‘May your God make Solomon’s name more famous than yours and his throne greater than yours!’ And the king bowed in worship on his bed "
"10376","1 Kings","1","48","and said, ‘Praise be to the Lord, the God of Israel, who has allowed my eyes to see a successor on my throne today.’ ”"
"10377","1 Kings","1","49","At this, all Adonijah’s guests rose in alarm and dispersed. "
"10378","1 Kings","1","50","But Adonijah, in fear of Solomon, went and took hold of the horns of the altar. "
"10379","1 Kings","1","51","Then Solomon was told, “Adonijah is afraid of King Solomon and is clinging to the horns of the altar. He says, ‘Let King Solomon swear to me today that he will not put his servant to death with the sword.’ ”"
"10380","1 Kings","1","52","Solomon replied, “If he shows himself to be worthy, not a hair of his head will fall to the ground; but if evil is found in him, he will die.” "
"10381","1 Kings","1","53","Then King Solomon sent men, and they brought him down from the altar. And Adonijah came and bowed down to King Solomon, and Solomon said, “Go to your home.”"
"10382","1 Kings","2","1","When the time drew near for David to die, he gave a charge to Solomon his son. "
"10383","1 Kings","2","2","""I am about to go the way of all the earth,” he said. “So be strong, act like a man, "
"10384","1 Kings","2","3","and observe what the Lord your God requires: Walk in obedience to him, and keep his decrees and commands, his laws and regulations, as written in the Law of Moses. Do this so that you may prosper in all you do and wherever you go "
"10385","1 Kings","2","4","and that the Lord may keep his promise to me: ‘If your descendants watch how they live, and if they walk faithfully before me with all their heart and soul, you will never fail to have a successor on the throne of Israel.’ "
"10386","1 Kings","2","5","""Now you yourself know what Joab son of Zeruiah did to me—what he did to the two commanders of Israel’s armies, Abner son of Ner and Amasa son of Jether. He killed them, shedding their blood in peacetime as if in battle, and with that blood he stained the belt around his waist and the sandals on his feet. "
"10387","1 Kings","2","6","Deal with him according to your wisdom, but do not let his gray head go down to the grave in peace. "
"10388","1 Kings","2","7","""But show kindness to the sons of Barzillai of Gilead and let them be among those who eat at your table. They stood by me when I fled from your brother Absalom. "
"10389","1 Kings","2","8","""And remember, you have with you Shimei son of Gera, the Benjamite from Bahurim, who called down bitter curses on me the day I went to Mahanaim. When he came down to meet me at the Jordan, I swore to him by the Lord: ‘I will not put you to death by the sword.’ "
"10390","1 Kings","2","9","But now, do not consider him innocent. You are a man of wisdom; you will know what to do to him. Bring his gray head down to the grave in blood.”"
"10391","1 Kings","2","10","Then David rested with his ancestors and was buried in the City of David. "
"10392","1 Kings","2","11","He had reigned forty years over Israel—seven years in Hebron and thirty-three in Jerusalem. "
"10393","1 Kings","2","12","So Solomon sat on the throne of his father David, and his rule was firmly established.Solomon’s Throne Established"
"10394","1 Kings","2","13","Now Adonijah, the son of Haggith, went to Bathsheba, Solomon’s mother. Bathsheba asked him, “Do you come peacefully?”He answered, “Yes, peacefully.” "
"10395","1 Kings","2","14","Then he added, “I have something to say to you.”“You may say it,” she replied. "
"10396","1 Kings","2","15","""As you know,” he said, “the kingdom was mine. All Israel looked to me as their king. But things changed, and the kingdom has gone to my brother; for it has come to him from the Lord. "
"10397","1 Kings","2","16","Now I have one request to make of you. Do not refuse me.”“You may make it,” she said."
"10398","1 Kings","2","17","So he continued, “Please ask King Solomon—he will not refuse you—to give me Abishag the Shunammite as my wife.” "
"10399","1 Kings","2","18","""Very well,” Bathsheba replied, “I will speak to the king for you.”"
"10400","1 Kings","2","19","When Bathsheba went to King Solomon to speak to him for Adonijah, the king stood up to meet her, bowed down to her and sat down on his throne. He had a throne brought for the king’s mother, and she sat down at his right hand. "
"10401","1 Kings","2","20","""I have one small request to make of you,” she said. “Do not refuse me.”The king replied, “Make it, my mother; I will not refuse you.”"
"10402","1 Kings","2","21","So she said, “Let Abishag the Shunammite be given in marriage to your brother Adonijah.”"
"10403","1 Kings","2","22","King Solomon answered his mother, “Why do you request Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? You might as well request the kingdom for him—after all, he is my older brother—yes, for him and for Abiathar the priest and Joab son of Zeruiah!”"
"10404","1 Kings","2","23","Then King Solomon swore by the Lord: “May God deal with me, be it ever so severely, if Adonijah does not pay with his life for this request! "
"10405","1 Kings","2","24","And now, as surely as the Lord lives—he who has established me securely on the throne of my father David and has founded a dynasty for me as he promised—Adonijah shall be put to death today!” "
"10406","1 Kings","2","25","So King Solomon gave orders to Benaiah son of Jehoiada, and he struck down Adonijah and he died."
"10407","1 Kings","2","26","To Abiathar the priest the king said, “Go back to your fields in Anathoth. You deserve to die, but I will not put you to death now, because you carried the ark of the Sovereign Lord before my father David and shared all my father’s hardships.” "
"10408","1 Kings","2","27","So Solomon removed Abiathar from the priesthood of the Lord, fulfilling the word the Lord had spoken at Shiloh about the house of Eli."
"10409","1 Kings","2","28","When the news reached Joab, who had conspired with Adonijah though not with Absalom, he fled to the tent of the Lord and took hold of the horns of the altar. "
"10410","1 Kings","2","29","King Solomon was told that Joab had fled to the tent of the Lord and was beside the altar. Then Solomon ordered Benaiah son of Jehoiada, “Go, strike him down!”"
"10411","1 Kings","2","30","So Benaiah entered the tent of the Lord and said to Joab, “The king says, ‘Come out!’ ”But he answered, “No, I will die here.”Benaiah reported to the king, “This is how Joab answered me.”"
"10412","1 Kings","2","31","Then the king commanded Benaiah, “Do as he says. Strike him down and bury him, and so clear me and my whole family of the guilt of the innocent blood that Joab shed. "
"10413","1 Kings","2","32","The Lord will repay him for the blood he shed, because without my father David knowing it he attacked two men and killed them with the sword. Both of them—Abner son of Ner, commander of Israel’s army, and Amasa son of Jether, commander of Judah’s army—were better men and more upright than he. "
"10414","1 Kings","2","33","May the guilt of their blood rest on the head of Joab and his descendants forever. But on David and his descendants, his house and his throne, may there be the Lord’s peace forever.”"
"10415","1 Kings","2","34","So Benaiah son of Jehoiada went up and struck down Joab and killed him, and he was buried at his home out in the country. "
"10416","1 Kings","2","35","The king put Benaiah son of Jehoiada over the army in Joab’s position and replaced Abiathar with Zadok the priest."
"10417","1 Kings","2","36","Then the king sent for Shimei and said to him, “Build yourself a house in Jerusalem and live there, but do not go anywhere else. "
"10418","1 Kings","2","37","The day you leave and cross the Kidron Valley, you can be sure you will die; your blood will be on your own head.”"
"10419","1 Kings","2","38","Shimei answered the king, “What you say is good. Your servant will do as my lord the king has said.” And Shimei stayed in Jerusalem for a long time."
"10420","1 Kings","2","39","But three years later, two of Shimei’s slaves ran off to Achish son of Maakah, king of Gath, and Shimei was told, “Your slaves are in Gath.” "
"10421","1 Kings","2","40","At this, he saddled his donkey and went to Achish at Gath in search of his slaves. So Shimei went away and brought the slaves back from Gath."
"10422","1 Kings","2","41","When Solomon was told that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath and had returned, "
"10423","1 Kings","2","42","the king summoned Shimei and said to him, “Did I not make you swear by the Lord and warn you, ‘On the day you leave to go anywhere else, you can be sure you will die’? At that time you said to me, ‘What you say is good. I will obey.’ "
"10424","1 Kings","2","43","Why then did you not keep your oath to the Lord and obey the command I gave you?”"
"10425","1 Kings","2","44","The king also said to Shimei, “You know in your heart all the wrong you did to my father David. Now the Lord will repay you for your wrongdoing. "
"10426","1 Kings","2","45","But King Solomon will be blessed, and David’s throne will remain secure before the Lord forever.”"
"10427","1 Kings","2","46","Then the king gave the order to Benaiah son of Jehoiada, and he went out and struck Shimei down and he died.The kingdom was now established in Solomon’s hands."
"10428","1 Kings","3","1","Solomon made an alliance with Pharaoh king of Egypt and married his daughter. He brought her to the City of David until he finished building his palace and the temple of the Lord, and the wall around Jerusalem. "
"10429","1 Kings","3","2","The people, however, were still sacrificing at the high places, because a temple had not yet been built for the Name of the Lord. "
"10430","1 Kings","3","3","Solomon showed his love for the Lord by walking according to the instructions given him by his father David, except that he offered sacrifices and burned incense on the high places."
"10431","1 Kings","3","4","The king went to Gibeon to offer sacrifices, for that was the most important high place, and Solomon offered a thousand burnt offerings on that altar. "
"10432","1 Kings","3","5","At Gibeon the Lord appeared to Solomon during the night in a dream, and God said, “Ask for whatever you want me to give you.”"
"10433","1 Kings","3","6","Solomon answered, “You have shown great kindness to your servant, my father David, because he was faithful to you and righteous and upright in heart. You have continued this great kindness to him and have given him a son to sit on his throne this very day. "
"10434","1 Kings","3","7","""Now, Lord my God, you have made your servant king in place of my father David. But I am only a little child and do not know how to carry out my duties. "
"10435","1 Kings","3","8","Your servant is here among the people you have chosen, a great people, too numerous to count or number. "
"10436","1 Kings","3","9","So give your servant a discerning heart to govern your people and to distinguish between right and wrong. For who is able to govern this great people of yours?”"
"10437","1 Kings","3","10","The Lord was pleased that Solomon had asked for this. "
"10438","1 Kings","3","11","So God said to him, “Since you have asked for this and not for long life or wealth for yourself, nor have asked for the death of your enemies but for discernment in administering justice, "
"10439","1 Kings","3","12","I will do what you have asked. I will give you a wise and discerning heart, so that there will never have been anyone like you, nor will there ever be. "
"10440","1 Kings","3","13","Moreover, I will give you what you have not asked for—both wealth and honor—so that in your lifetime you will have no equal among kings. "
"10441","1 Kings","3","14","And if you walk in obedience to me and keep my decrees and commands as David your father did, I will give you a long life.” "
"10442","1 Kings","3","15","Then Solomon awoke—and he realized it had been a dream.He returned to Jerusalem, stood before the ark of the Lord’s covenant and sacrificed burnt offerings and fellowship offerings. Then he gave a feast for all his court.A Wise Ruling"
"10443","1 Kings","3","16","Now two prostitutes came to the king and stood before him. "
"10444","1 Kings","3","17","One of them said, “Pardon me, my lord. This woman and I live in the same house, and I had a baby while she was there with me. "
"10445","1 Kings","3","18","The third day after my child was born, this woman also had a baby. We were alone; there was no one in the house but the two of us. "
"10446","1 Kings","3","19","""During the night this woman’s son died because she lay on him. "
"10447","1 Kings","3","20","So she got up in the middle of the night and took my son from my side while I your servant was asleep. She put him by her breast and put her dead son by my breast. "
"10448","1 Kings","3","21","The next morning, I got up to nurse my son—and he was dead! But when I looked at him closely in the morning light, I saw that it wasn’t the son I had borne.”"
"10449","1 Kings","3","22","The other woman said, “No! The living one is my son; the dead one is yours.”But the first one insisted, “No! The dead one is yours; the living one is mine.” And so they argued before the king."
"10450","1 Kings","3","23","The king said, “This one says, ‘My son is alive and your son is dead,’ while that one says, ‘No! Your son is dead and mine is alive.’ ”"
"10451","1 Kings","3","24","Then the king said, “Bring me a sword.” So they brought a sword for the king. "
"10452","1 Kings","3","25","He then gave an order: “Cut the living child in two and give half to one and half to the other.”"
"10453","1 Kings","3","26","The woman whose son was alive was deeply moved out of love for her son and said to the king, “Please, my lord, give her the living baby! Don’t kill him!”But the other said, “Neither I nor you shall have him. Cut him in two!”"
"10454","1 Kings","3","27","Then the king gave his ruling: “Give the living baby to the first woman. Do not kill him; she is his mother.”"
"10455","1 Kings","3","28","When all Israel heard the verdict the king had given, they held the king in awe, because they saw that he had wisdom from God to administer justice."
"10456","1 Kings","4","1","So King Solomon ruled over all Israel. "
"10457","1 Kings","4","2","And these were his chief officials:Azariah son of Zadok—the priest;"
"10458","1 Kings","4","3","Elihoreph and Ahijah, sons of Shisha—secretaries;Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud—recorder;"

"10462","1 Kings","4","7","Solomon had twelve district governors over all Israel, who supplied provisions for the king and the royal household. Each one had to provide supplies for one month in the year. "
"10463","1 Kings","4","8","These are their names:Ben-Hur—in the hill country of Ephraim;"
"10464","1 Kings","4","9","Ben-Deker—in Makaz, Shaalbim, Beth Shemesh and Elon Bethhanan;"

"10475","1 Kings","4","20","The people of Judah and Israel were as numerous as the sand on the seashore; they ate, they drank and they were happy. "
"10476","1 Kings","4","21","And Solomon ruled over all the kingdoms from the Euphrates River to the land of the Philistines, as far as the border of Egypt. These countries brought tribute and were Solomon’s subjects all his life."
"10477","1 Kings","4","22","Solomon’s daily provisions were thirty cors4:22 That is, probably about 5 1/2 tons or about 5 metric tons of the finest flour and sixty cors4:22 That is, probably about 11 tons or about 10 metric tons of meal, "

"10479","1 Kings","4","24","For he ruled over all the kingdoms west of the Euphrates River, from Tiphsah to Gaza, and had peace on all sides. "
"10480","1 Kings","4","25","During Solomon’s lifetime Judah and Israel, from Dan to Beersheba, lived in safety, everyone under their own vine and under their own fig tree."

"10482","1 Kings","4","27","The district governors, each in his month, supplied provisions for King Solomon and all who came to the king’s table. They saw to it that nothing was lacking. "
"10483","1 Kings","4","28","They also brought to the proper place their quotas of barley and straw for the chariot horses and the other horses.Solomon’s Wisdom"
"10484","1 Kings","4","29","God gave Solomon wisdom and very great insight, and a breadth of understanding as measureless as the sand on the seashore. "
"10485","1 Kings","4","30","Solomon’s wisdom was greater than the wisdom of all the people of the East, and greater than all the wisdom of Egypt. "
"10486","1 Kings","4","31","He was wiser than anyone else, including Ethan the Ezrahite—wiser than Heman, Kalkol and Darda, the sons of Mahol. And his fame spread to all the surrounding nations. "
"10487","1 Kings","4","32","He spoke three thousand proverbs and his songs numbered a thousand and five. "
"10488","1 Kings","4","33","He spoke about plant life, from the cedar of Lebanon to the hyssop that grows out of walls. He also spoke about animals and birds, reptiles and fish. "
"10489","1 Kings","4","34","From all nations people came to listen to Solomon’s wisdom, sent by all the kings of the world, who had heard of his wisdom.4:34 In Hebrew texts 4:21-34 is numbered 5:1-14."
"10490","1 Kings","5","1","When Hiram king of Tyre heard that Solomon had been anointed king to succeed his father David, he sent his envoys to Solomon, because he had always been on friendly terms with David. "
"10491","1 Kings","5","2","Solomon sent back this message to Hiram: "
"10492","1 Kings","5","3","""You know that because of the wars waged against my father David from all sides, he could not build a temple for the Name of the Lord his God until the Lord put his enemies under his feet. "
"10493","1 Kings","5","4","But now the Lord my God has given me rest on every side, and there is no adversary or disaster. "
"10494","1 Kings","5","5","I intend, therefore, to build a temple for the Name of the Lord my God, as the Lord told my father David, when he said, ‘Your son whom I will put on the throne in your place will build the temple for my Name.’ "
"10495","1 Kings","5","6","""So give orders that cedars of Lebanon be cut for me. My men will work with yours, and I will pay you for your men whatever wages you set. You know that we have no one so skilled in felling timber as the Sidonians.”"
"10496","1 Kings","5","7","When Hiram heard Solomon’s message, he was greatly pleased and said, “Praise be to the Lord today, for he has given David a wise son to rule over this great nation.”"
"10497","1 Kings","5","8","So Hiram sent word to Solomon:“I have received the message you sent me and will do all you want in providing the cedar and juniper logs. "
"10498","1 Kings","5","9","My men will haul them down from Lebanon to the Mediterranean Sea, and I will float them as rafts by sea to the place you specify. There I will separate them and you can take them away. And you are to grant my wish by providing food for my royal household.”"
"10499","1 Kings","5","10","In this way Hiram kept Solomon supplied with all the cedar and juniper logs he wanted, "
"10500","1 Kings","5","11","and Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand cors5:11 That is, probably about 3,600 tons or about 3,250 metric tons of wheat as food for his household, in addition to twenty thousand baths5:11 Septuagint (see also 2 Chron. 2:10); Hebrew twenty cors5:11 That is, about 120,000 gallons or about 440,000 liters of pressed olive oil. Solomon continued to do this for Hiram year after year. "
"10501","1 Kings","5","12","The Lord gave Solomon wisdom, just as he had promised him. There were peaceful relations between Hiram and Solomon, and the two of them made a treaty."
"10502","1 Kings","5","13","King Solomon conscripted laborers from all Israel—thirty thousand men. "
"10503","1 Kings","5","14","He sent them off to Lebanon in shifts of ten thousand a month, so that they spent one month in Lebanon and two months at home. Adoniram was in charge of the forced labor. "
"10504","1 Kings","5","15","Solomon had seventy thousand carriers and eighty thousand stonecutters in the hills, "
"10505","1 Kings","5","16","as well as thirty-three hundred5:16 Hebrew; some Septuagint manuscripts (see also 2 Chron. 2:2,18) thirty-six hundred foremen who supervised the project and directed the workers. "
"10506","1 Kings","5","17","At the king’s command they removed from the quarry large blocks of high-grade stone to provide a foundation of dressed stone for the temple. "
"10507","1 Kings","5","18","The craftsmen of Solomon and Hiram and workers from Byblos cut and prepared the timber and stone for the building of the temple."
"10508","1 Kings","6","1","In the four hundred and eightieth6:1 Hebrew; Septuagint four hundred and fortieth year after the Israelites came out of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon’s reign over Israel, in the month of Ziv, the second month, he began to build the temple of the Lord."
"10509","1 Kings","6","2","The temple that King Solomon built for the Lord was sixty cubits long, twenty wide and thirty high.6:2 That is, about 90 feet long, 30 feet wide and 45 feet high or about 27 meters long, 9 meters wide and 14 meters high "
"10510","1 Kings","6","3","The portico at the front of the main hall of the temple extended the width of the temple, that is twenty cubits,6:3 That is, about 30 feet or about 9 meters; also in verses 16 and 20 and projected ten cubits6:3 That is, about 15 feet or about 4.5 meters; also in verses 23-26 from the front of the temple. "
"10511","1 Kings","6","4","He made narrow windows high up in the temple walls. "
"10512","1 Kings","6","5","Against the walls of the main hall and inner sanctuary he built a structure around the building, in which there were side rooms. "
"10513","1 Kings","6","6","The lowest floor was five cubits6:6 That is, about 7 1/2 feet or about 2.3 meters; also in verses 10 and 24 wide, the middle floor six cubits6:6 That is, about 9 feet or about 2.7 meters and the third floor seven.6:6 That is, about 11 feet or about 3.2 meters He made offset ledges around the outside of the temple so that nothing would be inserted into the temple walls."
"10514","1 Kings","6","7","In building the temple, only blocks dressed at the quarry were used, and no hammer, chisel or any other iron tool was heard at the temple site while it was being built."
"10515","1 Kings","6","8","The entrance to the lowest6:8 Septuagint; Hebrew middle floor was on the south side of the temple; a stairway led up to the middle level and from there to the third. "
"10516","1 Kings","6","9","So he built the temple and completed it, roofing it with beams and cedar planks. "
"10517","1 Kings","6","10","And he built the side rooms all along the temple. The height of each was five cubits, and they were attached to the temple by beams of cedar."
"10518","1 Kings","6","11","The word of the Lord came to Solomon:  "
"10519","1 Kings","6","12","""As for this temple you are building, if you follow my decrees, observe my laws and keep all my commands and obey them, I will fulfill through you the promise I gave to David your father. "
"10520","1 Kings","6","13","And I will live among the Israelites and will not abandon my people Israel.”"
"10521","1 Kings","6","14","So Solomon built the temple and completed it. "
"10522","1 Kings","6","15","He lined its interior walls with cedar boards, paneling them from the floor of the temple to the ceiling, and covered the floor of the temple with planks of juniper. "
"10523","1 Kings","6","16","He partitioned off twenty cubits at the rear of the temple with cedar boards from floor to ceiling to form within the temple an inner sanctuary, the Most Holy Place. "
"10524","1 Kings","6","17","The main hall in front of this room was forty cubits6:17 That is, about 60 feet or about 18 meters long. "
"10525","1 Kings","6","18","The inside of the temple was cedar, carved with gourds and open flowers. Everything was cedar; no stone was to be seen."
"10526","1 Kings","6","19","He prepared the inner sanctuary within the temple to set the ark of the covenant of the Lord there. "
"10527","1 Kings","6","20","The inner sanctuary was twenty cubits long, twenty wide and twenty high. He overlaid the inside with pure gold, and he also overlaid the altar of cedar. "
"10528","1 Kings","6","21","Solomon covered the inside of the temple with pure gold, and he extended gold chains across the front of the inner sanctuary, which was overlaid with gold. "
"10529","1 Kings","6","22","So he overlaid the whole interior with gold. He also overlaid with gold the altar that belonged to the inner sanctuary."
"10530","1 Kings","6","23","For the inner sanctuary he made a pair of cherubim out of olive wood, each ten cubits high. "
"10531","1 Kings","6","24","One wing of the first cherub was five cubits long, and the other wing five cubits—ten cubits from wing tip to wing tip. "
"10532","1 Kings","6","25","The second cherub also measured ten cubits, for the two cherubim were identical in size and shape. "
"10533","1 Kings","6","26","The height of each cherub was ten cubits. "
"10534","1 Kings","6","27","He placed the cherubim inside the innermost room of the temple, with their wings spread out. The wing of one cherub touched one wall, while the wing of the other touched the other wall, and their wings touched each other in the middle of the room. "
"10535","1 Kings","6","28","He overlaid the cherubim with gold."
"10536","1 Kings","6","29","On the walls all around the temple, in both the inner and outer rooms, he carved cherubim, palm trees and open flowers. "
"10537","1 Kings","6","30","He also covered the floors of both the inner and outer rooms of the temple with gold."
"10538","1 Kings","6","31","For the entrance to the inner sanctuary he made doors out of olive wood that were one fifth of the width of the sanctuary. "
"10539","1 Kings","6","32","And on the two olive-wood doors he carved cherubim, palm trees and open flowers, and overlaid the cherubim and palm trees with hammered gold. "
"10540","1 Kings","6","33","In the same way, for the entrance to the main hall he made doorframes out of olive wood that were one fourth of the width of the hall. "
"10541","1 Kings","6","34","He also made two doors out of juniper wood, each having two leaves that turned in sockets. "
"10542","1 Kings","6","35","He carved cherubim, palm trees and open flowers on them and overlaid them with gold hammered evenly over the carvings."
"10543","1 Kings","6","36","And he built the inner courtyard of three courses of dressed stone and one course of trimmed cedar beams."
"10544","1 Kings","6","37","The foundation of the temple of the Lord was laid in the fourth year, in the month of Ziv. "
"10545","1 Kings","6","38","In the eleventh year in the month of Bul, the eighth month, the temple was finished in all its details according to its specifications. He had spent seven years building it."
"10546","1 Kings","7","1","It took Solomon thirteen years, however, to complete the construction of his palace. "
"10547","1 Kings","7","2","He built the Palace of the Forest of Lebanon a hundred cubits long, fifty wide and thirty high,7:2 That is, about 150 feet long, 75 feet wide and 45 feet high or about 45 meters long, 23 meters wide and 14 meters high with four rows of cedar columns supporting trimmed cedar beams. "
"10548","1 Kings","7","3","It was roofed with cedar above the beams that rested on the columns—forty-five beams, fifteen to a row. "
"10549","1 Kings","7","4","Its windows were placed high in sets of three, facing each other. "
"10550","1 Kings","7","5","All the doorways had rectangular frames; they were in the front part in sets of three, facing each other.7:5 The meaning of the Hebrew for this verse is uncertain."
"10551","1 Kings","7","6","He made a colonnade fifty cubits long and thirty wide.7:6 That is, about 75 feet long and 45 feet wide or about 23 meters long and 14 meters wide In front of it was a portico, and in front of that were pillars and an overhanging roof."
"10552","1 Kings","7","7","He built the throne hall, the Hall of Justice, where he was to judge, and he covered it with cedar from floor to ceiling.7:7 Vulgate and Syriac; Hebrew floor "
"10553","1 Kings","7","8","And the palace in which he was to live, set farther back, was similar in design. Solomon also made a palace like this hall for Pharaoh’s daughter, whom he had married."
"10554","1 Kings","7","9","All these structures, from the outside to the great courtyard and from foundation to eaves, were made of blocks of high-grade stone cut to size and smoothed on their inner and outer faces. "
"10555","1 Kings","7","10","The foundations were laid with large stones of good quality, some measuring ten cubits7:10 That is, about 15 feet or about 4.5 meters; also in verse 23 and some eight.7:10 That is, about 12 feet or about 3.6 meters "
"10556","1 Kings","7","11","Above were high-grade stones, cut to size, and cedar beams. "
"10557","1 Kings","7","12","The great courtyard was surrounded by a wall of three courses of dressed stone and one course of trimmed cedar beams, as was the inner courtyard of the temple of the Lord with its portico.The Temple’s Furnishings"
"10558","1 Kings","7","13","King Solomon sent to Tyre and brought Huram,7:13 Hebrew Hiram, a variant of Huram; also in verses 40 and 45 "
"10559","1 Kings","7","14","whose mother was a widow from the tribe of Naphtali and whose father was from Tyre and a skilled craftsman in bronze. Huram was filled with wisdom, with understanding and with knowledge to do all kinds of bronze work. He came to King Solomon and did all the work assigned to him."
"10560","1 Kings","7","15","He cast two bronze pillars, each eighteen cubits high and twelve cubits in circumference.7:15 That is, about 27 feet high and 18 feet in circumference or about 8.1 meters high and 5.4 meters in circumference "
"10561","1 Kings","7","16","He also made two capitals of cast bronze to set on the tops of the pillars; each capital was five cubits7:16 That is, about 7 1/2 feet or about 2.3 meters; also in verse 23 high. "
"10562","1 Kings","7","17","A network of interwoven chains adorned the capitals on top of the pillars, seven for each capital. "
"10563","1 Kings","7","18","He made pomegranates in two rows7:18 Two Hebrew manuscripts and Septuagint; most Hebrew manuscripts made the pillars, and there were two rows encircling each network to decorate the capitals on top of the pillars.7:18 Many Hebrew manuscripts and Syriac; most Hebrew manuscripts pomegranates He did the same for each capital. "
"10564","1 Kings","7","19","The capitals on top of the pillars in the portico were in the shape of lilies, four cubits7:19 That is, about 6 feet or about 1.8 meters; also in verse 38 high. "
"10565","1 Kings","7","20","On the capitals of both pillars, above the bowl-shaped part next to the network, were the two hundred pomegranates in rows all around. "
"10566","1 Kings","7","21","He erected the pillars at the portico of the temple. The pillar to the south he named Jakin7:21 Jakin probably means he establishes. and the one to the north Boaz.7:21 Boaz probably means in him is strength. "
"10567","1 Kings","7","22","The capitals on top were in the shape of lilies. And so the work on the pillars was completed."
"10568","1 Kings","7","23","He made the Sea of cast metal, circular in shape, measuring ten cubits from rim to rim and five cubits high. It took a line of thirty cubits7:23 That is, about 45 feet or about 14 meters to measure around it. "
"10569","1 Kings","7","24","Below the rim, gourds encircled it—ten to a cubit. The gourds were cast in two rows in one piece with the Sea."
"10570","1 Kings","7","25","The Sea stood on twelve bulls, three facing north, three facing west, three facing south and three facing east. The Sea rested on top of them, and their hindquarters were toward the center. "
"10571","1 Kings","7","26","It was a handbreadth7:26 That is, about 3 inches or about 7.5 centimeters in thickness, and its rim was like the rim of a cup, like a lily blossom. It held two thousand baths.7:26 That is, about 12,000 gallons or about 44,000 liters; the Septuagint does not have this sentence."
"10572","1 Kings","7","27","He also made ten movable stands of bronze; each was four cubits long, four wide and three high.7:27 That is, about 6 feet long and wide and about 4 1/2 feet high or about 1.8 meters long and wide and 1.4 meters high "
"10573","1 Kings","7","28","This is how the stands were made: They had side panels attached to uprights. "
"10574","1 Kings","7","29","On the panels between the uprights were lions, bulls and cherubim—and on the uprights as well. Above and below the lions and bulls were wreaths of hammered work. "
"10575","1 Kings","7","30","Each stand had four bronze wheels with bronze axles, and each had a basin resting on four supports, cast with wreaths on each side. "
"10576","1 Kings","7","31","On the inside of the stand there was an opening that had a circular frame one cubit7:31 That is, about 18 inches or about 45 centimeters deep. This opening was round, and with its basework it measured a cubit and a half.7:31 That is, about 2 1/4 feet or about 68 centimeters; also in verse 32 Around its opening there was engraving. The panels of the stands were square, not round. "
"10577","1 Kings","7","32","The four wheels were under the panels, and the axles of the wheels were attached to the stand. The diameter of each wheel was a cubit and a half. "
"10578","1 Kings","7","33","The wheels were made like chariot wheels; the axles, rims, spokes and hubs were all of cast metal."
"10579","1 Kings","7","34","Each stand had four handles, one on each corner, projecting from the stand. "
"10580","1 Kings","7","35","At the top of the stand there was a circular band half a cubit7:35 That is, about 9 inches or about 23 centimeters deep. The supports and panels were attached to the top of the stand. "

"10582","1 Kings","7","37","This is the way he made the ten stands. They were all cast in the same molds and were identical in size and shape."
"10583","1 Kings","7","38","He then made ten bronze basins, each holding forty baths7:38 That is, about 240 gallons or about 880 liters and measuring four cubits across, one basin to go on each of the ten stands. "
"10584","1 Kings","7","39","He placed five of the stands on the south side of the temple and five on the north. He placed the Sea on the south side, at the southeast corner of the temple. "
"10585","1 Kings","7","40","He also made the pots7:40 Many Hebrew manuscripts, Septuagint, Syriac and Vulgate (see also verse 45 and 2 Chron. 4:11); many other Hebrew manuscripts basins and shovels and sprinkling bowls.So Huram finished all the work he had undertaken for King Solomon in the temple of the Lord:"
"10586","1 Kings","7","41","the two pillars;the two bowl-shaped capitals on top of the pillars;the two sets of network decorating the two bowl-shaped capitals on top of the pillars;"
"10587","1 Kings","7","42","the four hundred pomegranates for the two sets of network (two rows of pomegranates for each network decorating the bowl-shaped capitals on top of the pillars);"
"10588","1 Kings","7","43","the ten stands with their ten basins;"
"10589","1 Kings","7","44","the Sea and the twelve bulls under it;"
"10590","1 Kings","7","45","the pots, shovels and sprinkling bowls.All these objects that Huram made for King Solomon for the temple of the Lord were of burnished bronze. "
"10591","1 Kings","7","46","The king had them cast in clay molds in the plain of the Jordan between Sukkoth and Zarethan. "
"10592","1 Kings","7","47","Solomon left all these things unweighed, because there were so many; the weight of the bronze was not determined."
"10593","1 Kings","7","48","Solomon also made all the furnishings that were in the Lord’s temple:the golden altar;the golden table on which was the bread of the Presence;"
"10594","1 Kings","7","49","the lampstands of pure gold (five on the right and five on the left, in front of the inner sanctuary);the gold floral work and lamps and tongs;"
"10595","1 Kings","7","50","the pure gold basins, wick trimmers, sprinkling bowls, dishes and censers;and the gold sockets for the doors of the innermost room, the Most Holy Place, and also for the doors of the main hall of the temple."
"10596","1 Kings","7","51","When all the work King Solomon had done for the temple of the Lord was finished, he brought in the things his father David had dedicated—the silver and gold and the furnishings—and he placed them in the treasuries of the Lord’s temple."
"10597","1 Kings","8","1","Then King Solomon summoned into his presence at Jerusalem the elders of Israel, all the heads of the tribes and the chiefs of the Israelite families, to bring up the ark of the Lord’s covenant from Zion, the City of David. "
"10598","1 Kings","8","2","All the Israelites came together to King Solomon at the time of the festival in the month of Ethanim, the seventh month."
"10599","1 Kings","8","3","When all the elders of Israel had arrived, the priests took up the ark, "
"10600","1 Kings","8","4","and they brought up the ark of the Lord and the tent of meeting and all the sacred furnishings in it. The priests and Levites carried them up, "
"10601","1 Kings","8","5","and King Solomon and the entire assembly of Israel that had gathered about him were before the ark, sacrificing so many sheep and cattle that they could not be recorded or counted."
"10602","1 Kings","8","6","The priests then brought the ark of the Lord’s covenant to its place in the inner sanctuary of the temple, the Most Holy Place, and put it beneath the wings of the cherubim. "
"10603","1 Kings","8","7","The cherubim spread their wings over the place of the ark and overshadowed the ark and its carrying poles. "
"10604","1 Kings","8","8","These poles were so long that their ends could be seen from the Holy Place in front of the inner sanctuary, but not from outside the Holy Place; and they are still there today. "
"10605","1 Kings","8","9","There was nothing in the ark except the two stone tablets that Moses had placed in it at Horeb, where the Lord made a covenant with the Israelites after they came out of Egypt."
"10606","1 Kings","8","10","When the priests withdrew from the Holy Place, the cloud filled the temple of the Lord. "
"10607","1 Kings","8","11","And the priests could not perform their service because of the cloud, for the glory of the Lord filled his temple."
"10608","1 Kings","8","12","Then Solomon said, “The Lord has said that he would dwell in a dark cloud; "
"10609","1 Kings","8","13","I have indeed built a magnificent temple for you, a place for you to dwell forever.”"
"10610","1 Kings","8","14","While the whole assembly of Israel was standing there, the king turned around and blessed them. "
"10611","1 Kings","8","15","Then he said:“Praise be to the Lord, the God of Israel, who with his own hand has fulfilled what he promised with his own mouth to my father David. For he said, 16‘Since the day I brought my people Israel out of Egypt, I have not chosen a city in any tribe of Israel to have a temple built so that my Name might be there, but I have chosen David to rule my people Israel.’ "
"10612","1 Kings","8","17","""My father David had it in his heart to build a temple for the Name of the Lord, the God of Israel. "
"10613","1 Kings","8","18","But the Lord said to my father David, ‘You did well to have it in your heart to build a temple for my Name. "
"10614","1 Kings","8","19","Nevertheless, you are not the one to build the temple, but your son, your own flesh and blood—he is the one who will build the temple for my Name.’ "
"10615","1 Kings","8","20","""The Lord has kept the promise he made: I have succeeded David my father and now I sit on the throne of Israel, just as the Lord promised, and I have built the temple for the Name of the Lord, the God of Israel. "

"10617","1 Kings","8","22","Then Solomon stood before the altar of the Lord in front of the whole assembly of Israel, spread out his hands toward heaven "
"10618","1 Kings","8","23","and said:“Lord, the God of Israel, there is no God like you in heaven above or on earth below—you who keep your covenant of love with your servants who continue wholeheartedly in your way. "
"10619","1 Kings","8","24","You have kept your promise to your servant David my father; with your mouth you have promised and with your hand you have fulfilled it—as it is today. "
"10620","1 Kings","8","25","""Now Lord, the God of Israel, keep for your servant David my father the promises you made to him when you said, ‘You shall never fail to have a successor to sit before me on the throne of Israel, if only your descendants are careful in all they do to walk before me faithfully as you have done.’ "
"10621","1 Kings","8","26","And now, God of Israel, let your word that you promised your servant David my father come true. "
"10622","1 Kings","8","27","""But will God really dwell on earth? The heavens, even the highest heaven, cannot contain you. How much less this temple I have built! "
"10623","1 Kings","8","28","Yet give attention to your servant’s prayer and his plea for mercy, Lord my God. Hear the cry and the prayer that your servant is praying in your presence this day. "
"10624","1 Kings","8","29","May your eyes be open toward this temple night and day, this place of which you said, ‘My Name shall be there,’ so that you will hear the prayer your servant prays toward this place. "
"10625","1 Kings","8","30","Hear the supplication of your servant and of your people Israel when they pray toward this place. Hear from heaven, your dwelling place, and when you hear, forgive. "
"10626","1 Kings","8","31","""When anyone wrongs their neighbor and is required to take an oath and they come and swear the oath before your altar in this temple, "

"10634","1 Kings","8","39","then hear from heaven, your dwelling place. Forgive and act; deal with everyone according to all they do, since you know their hearts (for you alone know every human heart), "

"10643","1 Kings","8","48","and if they turn back to you with all their heart and soul in the land of their enemies who took them captive, and pray to you toward the land you gave their ancestors, toward the city you have chosen and the temple I have built for your Name; "

"10645","1 Kings","8","50","And forgive your people, who have sinned against you; forgive all the offenses they have committed against you, and cause their captors to show them mercy; "
"10646","1 Kings","8","51","for they are your people and your inheritance, whom you brought out of Egypt, out of that iron-smelting furnace. "
"10647","1 Kings","8","52","""May your eyes be open to your servant’s plea and to the plea of your people Israel, and may you listen to them whenever they cry out to you. "
"10648","1 Kings","8","53","For you singled them out from all the nations of the world to be your own inheritance, just as you declared through your servant Moses when you, Sovereign Lord, brought our ancestors out of Egypt.”"
"10649","1 Kings","8","54","When Solomon had finished all these prayers and supplications to the Lord, he rose from before the altar of the Lord, where he had been kneeling with his hands spread out toward heaven. "
"10650","1 Kings","8","55","He stood and blessed the whole assembly of Israel in a loud voice, saying: "

"10656","1 Kings","8","61","And may your hearts be fully committed to the Lord our God, to live by his decrees and obey his commands, as at this time.”The Dedication of the Temple"
"10657","1 Kings","8","62","Then the king and all Israel with him offered sacrifices before the Lord. "
"10658","1 Kings","8","63","Solomon offered a sacrifice of fellowship offerings to the Lord: twenty-two thousand cattle and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep and goats. So the king and all the Israelites dedicated the temple of the Lord."
"10659","1 Kings","8","64","On that same day the king consecrated the middle part of the courtyard in front of the temple of the Lord, and there he offered burnt offerings, grain offerings and the fat of the fellowship offerings, because the bronze altar that stood before the Lord was too small to hold the burnt offerings, the grain offerings and the fat of the fellowship offerings."
"10660","1 Kings","8","65","So Solomon observed the festival at that time, and all Israel with him—a vast assembly, people from Lebo Hamath to the Wadi of Egypt. They celebrated it before the Lord our God for seven days and seven days more, fourteen days in all. "
"10661","1 Kings","8","66","On the following day he sent the people away. They blessed the king and then went home, joyful and glad in heart for all the good things the Lord had done for his servant David and his people Israel."
"10662","1 Kings","9","1","When Solomon had finished building the temple of the Lord and the royal palace, and had achieved all he had desired to do, "
"10663","1 Kings","9","2","the Lord appeared to him a second time, as he had appeared to him at Gibeon. "
"10664","1 Kings","9","3","The Lord said to him:“I have heard the prayer and plea you have made before me; I have consecrated this temple, which you have built, by putting my Name there forever. My eyes and my heart will always be there. "
"10665","1 Kings","9","4","""As for you, if you walk before me faithfully with integrity of heart and uprightness, as David your father did, and do all I command and observe my decrees and laws, "
"10666","1 Kings","9","5","I will establish your royal throne over Israel forever, as I promised David your father when I said, ‘You shall never fail to have a successor on the throne of Israel.’ "
"10667","1 Kings","9","6","""But if you9:6 The Hebrew is plural. or your descendants turn away from me and do not observe the commands and decrees I have given you9:6 The Hebrew is plural. and go off to serve other gods and worship them, "
"10668","1 Kings","9","7","then I will cut off Israel from the land I have given them and will reject this temple I have consecrated for my Name. Israel will then become a byword and an object of ridicule among all peoples. "
"10669","1 Kings","9","8","This temple will become a heap of rubble. All9:8 See some Septuagint manuscripts, Old Latin, Syriac, Arabic and Targum; Hebrew And though this temple is now imposing, all who pass by will be appalled and will scoff and say, ‘Why has the Lord done such a thing to this land and to this temple?’ "
"10670","1 Kings","9","9","People will answer, ‘Because they have forsaken the Lord their God, who brought their ancestors out of Egypt, and have embraced other gods, worshiping and serving them—that is why the Lord brought all this disaster on them.’ ”Solomon’s Other Activities"
"10671","1 Kings","9","10","At the end of twenty years, during which Solomon built these two buildings—the temple of the Lord and the royal palace— "
"10672","1 Kings","9","11","King Solomon gave twenty towns in Galilee to Hiram king of Tyre, because Hiram had supplied him with all the cedar and juniper and gold he wanted. "
"10673","1 Kings","9","12","But when Hiram went from Tyre to see the towns that Solomon had given him, he was not pleased with them.  "
"10674","1 Kings","9","13","""What kind of towns are these you have given me, my brother?” he asked. And he called them the Land of Kabul,9:13 Kabul sounds like the Hebrew for good-for-nothing. a name they have to this day. "
"10675","1 Kings","9","14","Now Hiram had sent to the king 120 talents9:14 That is, about 4 1/2 tons or about 4 metric tons of gold."
"10676","1 Kings","9","15","Here is the account of the forced labor King Solomon conscripted to build the Lord’s temple, his own palace, the terraces,9:15 Or the Millo; also in verse 24 the wall of Jerusalem, and Hazor, Megiddo and Gezer. 16(Pharaoh king of Egypt had attacked and captured Gezer. He had set it on fire. He killed its Canaanite inhabitants and then gave it as a wedding gift to his daughter, Solomon’s wife. "
"10677","1 Kings","9","17","And Solomon rebuilt Gezer.) He built up Lower Beth Horon, "
"10678","1 Kings","9","18","Baalath, and Tadmor9:18 The Hebrew may also be read Tamar. in the desert, within his land, "
"10679","1 Kings","9","19","as well as all his store cities and the towns for his chariots and for his horses9:19 Or charioteers—whatever he desired to build in Jerusalem, in Lebanon and throughout all the territory he ruled."
"10680","1 Kings","9","20","There were still people left from the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites (these peoples were not Israelites). "
"10681","1 Kings","9","21","Solomon conscripted the descendants of all these peoples remaining in the land—whom the Israelites could not exterminate9:21 The Hebrew term refers to the irrevocable giving over of things or persons to the Lord, often by totally destroying them.—to serve as slave labor, as it is to this day. "
"10682","1 Kings","9","22","But Solomon did not make slaves of any of the Israelites; they were his fighting men, his government officials, his officers, his captains, and the commanders of his chariots and charioteers. "
"10683","1 Kings","9","23","They were also the chief officials in charge of Solomon’s projects—550 officials supervising those who did the work."
"10684","1 Kings","9","24","After Pharaoh’s daughter had come up from the City of David to the palace Solomon had built for her, he constructed the terraces."
"10685","1 Kings","9","25","Three times a year Solomon sacrificed burnt offerings and fellowship offerings on the altar he had built for the Lord, burning incense before the Lord along with them, and so fulfilled the temple obligations."
"10686","1 Kings","9","26","King Solomon also built ships at Ezion Geber, which is near Elath in Edom, on the shore of the Red Sea.9:26 Or the Sea of Reeds "
"10687","1 Kings","9","27","And Hiram sent his men—sailors who knew the sea—to serve in the fleet with Solomon’s men. "
"10688","1 Kings","9","28","They sailed to Ophir and brought back 420 talents9:28 That is, about 16 tons or about 14 metric tons of gold, which they delivered to King Solomon."
"10689","1 Kings","10","1","When the queen of Sheba heard about the fame of Solomon and his relationship to the Lord, she came to test Solomon with hard questions. "
"10690","1 Kings","10","2","Arriving at Jerusalem with a very great caravan—with camels carrying spices, large quantities of gold, and precious stones—she came to Solomon and talked with him about all that she had on her mind. "
"10691","1 Kings","10","3","Solomon answered all her questions; nothing was too hard for the king to explain to her. "
"10692","1 Kings","10","4","When the queen of Sheba saw all the wisdom of Solomon and the palace he had built, "

"10694","1 Kings","10","6","She said to the king, “The report I heard in my own country about your achievements and your wisdom is true. "
"10695","1 Kings","10","7","But I did not believe these things until I came and saw with my own eyes. Indeed, not even half was told me; in wisdom and wealth you have far exceeded the report I heard. "
"10696","1 Kings","10","8","How happy your people must be! How happy your officials, who continually stand before you and hear your wisdom! "
"10697","1 Kings","10","9","Praise be to the Lord your God, who has delighted in you and placed you on the throne of Israel. Because of the Lord’s eternal love for Israel, he has made you king to maintain justice and righteousness.”"
"10698","1 Kings","10","10","And she gave the king 120 talents10:10 That is, about 4 1/2 tons or about 4 metric tons of gold, large quantities of spices, and precious stones. Never again were so many spices brought in as those the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon.11(Hiram’s ships brought gold from Ophir; and from there they brought great cargoes of almugwood10:11 Probably a variant of algumwood; also in verse 12 and precious stones. "
"10699","1 Kings","10","12","The king used the almugwood to make supports10:12 The meaning of the Hebrew for this word is uncertain. for the temple of the Lord and for the royal palace, and to make harps and lyres for the musicians. So much almugwood has never been imported or seen since that day.)"
"10700","1 Kings","10","13","King Solomon gave the queen of Sheba all she desired and asked for, besides what he had given her out of his royal bounty. Then she left and returned with her retinue to her own country.Solomon’s Splendor"
"10701","1 Kings","10","14","The weight of the gold that Solomon received yearly was 666 talents,10:14 That is, about 25 tons or about 23 metric tons "
"10702","1 Kings","10","15","not including the revenues from merchants and traders and from all the Arabian kings and the governors of the territories."
"10703","1 Kings","10","16","King Solomon made two hundred large shields of hammered gold; six hundred shekels10:16 That is, about 15 pounds or about 6.9 kilograms; also in verse 29 of gold went into each shield. "
"10704","1 Kings","10","17","He also made three hundred small shields of hammered gold, with three minas10:17 That is, about 3 3/4 pounds or about 1.7 kilograms; or perhaps reference is to double minas, that is, about 7 1/2 pounds or about 3.5 kilograms. of gold in each shield. The king put them in the Palace of the Forest of Lebanon."
"10705","1 Kings","10","18","Then the king made a great throne covered with ivory and overlaid with fine gold. "
"10706","1 Kings","10","19","The throne had six steps, and its back had a rounded top. On both sides of the seat were armrests, with a lion standing beside each of them. "
"10707","1 Kings","10","20","Twelve lions stood on the six steps, one at either end of each step. Nothing like it had ever been made for any other kingdom. "
"10708","1 Kings","10","21","All King Solomon’s goblets were gold, and all the household articles in the Palace of the Forest of Lebanon were pure gold. Nothing was made of silver, because silver was considered of little value in Solomon’s days. "
"10709","1 Kings","10","22","The king had a fleet of trading ships10:22 Hebrew of ships of Tarshish at sea along with the ships of Hiram. Once every three years it returned, carrying gold, silver and ivory, and apes and baboons."
"10710","1 Kings","10","23","King Solomon was greater in riches and wisdom than all the other kings of the earth. "
"10711","1 Kings","10","24","The whole world sought audience with Solomon to hear the wisdom God had put in his heart. "
"10712","1 Kings","10","25","Year after year, everyone who came brought a gift—articles of silver and gold, robes, weapons and spices, and horses and mules."
"10713","1 Kings","10","26","Solomon accumulated chariots and horses; he had fourteen hundred chariots and twelve thousand horses,10:26 Or charioteers which he kept in the chariot cities and also with him in Jerusalem. "
"10714","1 Kings","10","27","The king made silver as common in Jerusalem as stones, and cedar as plentiful as sycamore-fig trees in the foothills. "
"10715","1 Kings","10","28","Solomon’s horses were imported from Egypt and from Kue10:28 Probably Cilicia—the royal merchants purchased them from Kue at the current price. "
"10716","1 Kings","10","29","They imported a chariot from Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty.10:29 That is, about 3 3/4 pounds or about 1.7 kilograms They also exported them to all the kings of the Hittites and of the Arameans."
"10717","1 Kings","11","1","King Solomon, however, loved many foreign women besides Pharaoh’s daughter—Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Sidonians and Hittites. "
"10718","1 Kings","11","2","They were from nations about which the Lord had told the Israelites, “You must not intermarry with them, because they will surely turn your hearts after their gods.” Nevertheless, Solomon held fast to them in love. "
"10719","1 Kings","11","3","He had seven hundred wives of royal birth and three hundred concubines, and his wives led him astray. "
"10720","1 Kings","11","4","As Solomon grew old, his wives turned his heart after other gods, and his heart was not fully devoted to the Lord his God, as the heart of David his father had been. "
"10721","1 Kings","11","5","He followed Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, and Molek the detestable god of the Ammonites. "
"10722","1 Kings","11","6","So Solomon did evil in the eyes of the Lord; he did not follow the Lord completely, as David his father had done."
"10723","1 Kings","11","7","On a hill east of Jerusalem, Solomon built a high place for Chemosh the detestable god of Moab, and for Molek the detestable god of the Ammonites. "
"10724","1 Kings","11","8","He did the same for all his foreign wives, who burned incense and offered sacrifices to their gods."
"10725","1 Kings","11","9","The Lord became angry with Solomon because his heart had turned away from the Lord, the God of Israel, who had appeared to him twice. "
"10726","1 Kings","11","10","Although he had forbidden Solomon to follow other gods, Solomon did not keep the Lord’s command. "
"10727","1 Kings","11","11","So the Lord said to Solomon, “Since this is your attitude and you have not kept my covenant and my decrees, which I commanded you, I will most certainly tear the kingdom away from you and give it to one of your subordinates. "
"10728","1 Kings","11","12","Nevertheless, for the sake of David your father, I will not do it during your lifetime. I will tear it out of the hand of your son. "

"10730","1 Kings","11","14","Then the Lord raised up against Solomon an adversary, Hadad the Edomite, from the royal line of Edom. "
"10731","1 Kings","11","15","Earlier when David was fighting with Edom, Joab the commander of the army, who had gone up to bury the dead, had struck down all the men in Edom. "
"10732","1 Kings","11","16","Joab and all the Israelites stayed there for six months, until they had destroyed all the men in Edom. "
"10733","1 Kings","11","17","But Hadad, still only a boy, fled to Egypt with some Edomite officials who had served his father. "
"10734","1 Kings","11","18","They set out from Midian and went to Paran. Then taking people from Paran with them, they went to Egypt, to Pharaoh king of Egypt, who gave Hadad a house and land and provided him with food."
"10735","1 Kings","11","19","Pharaoh was so pleased with Hadad that he gave him a sister of his own wife, Queen Tahpenes, in marriage. "
"10736","1 Kings","11","20","The sister of Tahpenes bore him a son named Genubath, whom Tahpenes brought up in the royal palace. There Genubath lived with Pharaoh’s own children."
"10737","1 Kings","11","21","While he was in Egypt, Hadad heard that David rested with his ancestors and that Joab the commander of the army was also dead. Then Hadad said to Pharaoh, “Let me go, that I may return to my own country.” "
"10738","1 Kings","11","22","""What have you lacked here that you want to go back to your own country?” Pharaoh asked.“Nothing,” Hadad replied, “but do let me go!”"
"10739","1 Kings","11","23","And God raised up against Solomon another adversary, Rezon son of Eliada, who had fled from his master, Hadadezer king of Zobah. "
"10740","1 Kings","11","24","When David destroyed Zobah’s army, Rezon gathered a band of men around him and became their leader; they went to Damascus, where they settled and took control. "
"10741","1 Kings","11","25","Rezon was Israel’s adversary as long as Solomon lived, adding to the trouble caused by Hadad. So Rezon ruled in Aram and was hostile toward Israel.Jeroboam Rebels Against Solomon"
"10742","1 Kings","11","26","Also, Jeroboam son of Nebat rebelled against the king. He was one of Solomon’s officials, an Ephraimite from Zeredah, and his mother was a widow named Zeruah."
"10743","1 Kings","11","27","Here is the account of how he rebelled against the king: Solomon had built the terraces11:27 Or the Millo and had filled in the gap in the wall of the city of David his father. "
"10744","1 Kings","11","28","Now Jeroboam was a man of standing, and when Solomon saw how well the young man did his work, he put him in charge of the whole labor force of the tribes of Joseph."
"10745","1 Kings","11","29","About that time Jeroboam was going out of Jerusalem, and Ahijah the prophet of Shiloh met him on the way, wearing a new cloak. The two of them were alone out in the country, "
"10746","1 Kings","11","30","and Ahijah took hold of the new cloak he was wearing and tore it into twelve pieces. "
"10747","1 Kings","11","31","Then he said to Jeroboam, “Take ten pieces for yourself, for this is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: ‘See, I am going to tear the kingdom out of Solomon’s hand and give you ten tribes. "
"10748","1 Kings","11","32","But for the sake of my servant David and the city of Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, he will have one tribe. "
"10749","1 Kings","11","33","I will do this because they have11:33 Hebrew; Septuagint, Vulgate and Syriac because he has forsaken me and worshiped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, Chemosh the god of the Moabites, and Molek the god of the Ammonites, and have not walked in obedience to me, nor done what is right in my eyes, nor kept my decrees and laws as David, Solomon’s father, did. "
"10750","1 Kings","11","34",""" ‘But I will not take the whole kingdom out of Solomon’s hand; I have made him ruler all the days of his life for the sake of David my servant, whom I chose and who obeyed my commands and decrees. "
"10751","1 Kings","11","35","I will take the kingdom from his son’s hands and give you ten tribes. "
"10752","1 Kings","11","36","I will give one tribe to his son so that David my servant may always have a lamp before me in Jerusalem, the city where I chose to put my Name. "
"10753","1 Kings","11","37","However, as for you, I will take you, and you will rule over all that your heart desires; you will be king over Israel. "
"10754","1 Kings","11","38","If you do whatever I command you and walk in obedience to me and do what is right in my eyes by obeying my decrees and commands, as David my servant did, I will be with you. I will build you a dynasty as enduring as the one I built for David and will give Israel to you. "
"10755","1 Kings","11","39","I will humble David’s descendants because of this, but not forever.’ ”"
"10756","1 Kings","11","40","Solomon tried to kill Jeroboam, but Jeroboam fled to Egypt, to Shishak the king, and stayed there until Solomon’s death.Solomon’s Death"
"10757","1 Kings","11","41","As for the other events of Solomon’s reign—all he did and the wisdom he displayed—are they not written in the book of the annals of Solomon? "
"10758","1 Kings","11","42","Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years. "
"10759","1 Kings","11","43","Then he rested with his ancestors and was buried in the city of David his father. And Rehoboam his son succeeded him as king."
"10760","1 Kings","12","1","Rehoboam went to Shechem, for all Israel had gone there to make him king. "
"10761","1 Kings","12","2","When Jeroboam son of Nebat heard this (he was still in Egypt, where he had fled from King Solomon), he returned from12:2 Or he remained in Egypt. "
"10762","1 Kings","12","3","So they sent for Jeroboam, and he and the whole assembly of Israel went to Rehoboam and said to him:  "
"10763","1 Kings","12","4","""Your father put a heavy yoke on us, but now lighten the harsh labor and the heavy yoke he put on us, and we will serve you.”"
"10764","1 Kings","12","5","Rehoboam answered, “Go away for three days and then come back to me.” So the people went away."
"10765","1 Kings","12","6","Then King Rehoboam consulted the elders who had served his father Solomon during his lifetime. “How would you advise me to answer these people?” he asked."
"10766","1 Kings","12","7","They replied, “If today you will be a servant to these people and serve them and give them a favorable answer, they will always be your servants.”"
"10767","1 Kings","12","8","But Rehoboam rejected the advice the elders gave him and consulted the young men who had grown up with him and were serving him. "
"10768","1 Kings","12","9","He asked them, “What is your advice? How should we answer these people who say to me, ‘Lighten the yoke your father put on us’?”"
"10769","1 Kings","12","10","The young men who had grown up with him replied, “These people have said to you, ‘Your father put a heavy yoke on us, but make our yoke lighter.’ Now tell them, ‘My little finger is thicker than my father’s waist. "
"10770","1 Kings","12","11","My father laid on you a heavy yoke; I will make it even heavier. My father scourged you with whips; I will scourge you with scorpions.’ ”"
"10771","1 Kings","12","12","Three days later Jeroboam and all the people returned to Rehoboam, as the king had said, “Come back to me in three days.” "
"10772","1 Kings","12","13","The king answered the people harshly. Rejecting the advice given him by the elders, "
"10773","1 Kings","12","14","he followed the advice of the young men and said, “My father made your yoke heavy; I will make it even heavier. My father scourged you with whips; I will scourge you with scorpions.” "
"10774","1 Kings","12","15","So the king did not listen to the people, for this turn of events was from the Lord, to fulfill the word the Lord had spoken to Jeroboam son of Nebat through Ahijah the Shilonite."
"10775","1 Kings","12","16","When all Israel saw that the king refused to listen to them, they answered the king:“What share do we have in David,what part in Jesse’s son?To your tents, Israel!Look after your own house, David!”So the Israelites went home. "
"10776","1 Kings","12","17","But as for the Israelites who were living in the towns of Judah, Rehoboam still ruled over them."
"10777","1 Kings","12","18","King Rehoboam sent out Adoniram,12:18 Some Septuagint manuscripts and Syriac (see also 4:6 and 5:14); Hebrew Adoram who was in charge of forced labor, but all Israel stoned him to death. King Rehoboam, however, managed to get into his chariot and escape to Jerusalem. "
"10778","1 Kings","12","19","So Israel has been in rebellion against the house of David to this day."
"10779","1 Kings","12","20","When all the Israelites heard that Jeroboam had returned, they sent and called him to the assembly and made him king over all Israel. Only the tribe of Judah remained loyal to the house of David."
"10780","1 Kings","12","21","When Rehoboam arrived in Jerusalem, he mustered all Judah and the tribe of Benjamin—a hundred and eighty thousand able young men—to go to war against Israel and to regain the kingdom for Rehoboam son of Solomon."
"10781","1 Kings","12","22","But this word of God came to Shemaiah the man of God:  "
"10782","1 Kings","12","23","""Say to Rehoboam son of Solomon king of Judah, to all Judah and Benjamin, and to the rest of the people, 24‘This is what the Lord says: Do not go up to fight against your brothers, the Israelites. Go home, every one of you, for this is my doing.’ ” So they obeyed the word of the Lord and went home again, as the Lord had ordered.Golden Calves at Bethel and Dan"
"10783","1 Kings","12","25","Then Jeroboam fortified Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim and lived there. From there he went out and built up Peniel.12:25 Hebrew Penuel, a variant of Peniel"
"10784","1 Kings","12","26","Jeroboam thought to himself, “The kingdom will now likely revert to the house of David. "
"10785","1 Kings","12","27","If these people go up to offer sacrifices at the temple of the Lord in Jerusalem, they will again give their allegiance to their lord, Rehoboam king of Judah. They will kill me and return to King Rehoboam.”"
"10786","1 Kings","12","28","After seeking advice, the king made two golden calves. He said to the people, “It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem. Here are your gods, Israel, who brought you up out of Egypt.” "
"10787","1 Kings","12","29","One he set up in Bethel, and the other in Dan. "
"10788","1 Kings","12","30","And this thing became a sin; the people came to worship the one at Bethel and went as far as Dan to worship the other.12:30 Probable reading of the original Hebrew text; Masoretic Text people went to the one as far as Dan"
"10789","1 Kings","12","31","Jeroboam built shrines on high places and appointed priests from all sorts of people, even though they were not Levites. "
"10790","1 Kings","12","32","He instituted a festival on the fifteenth day of the eighth month, like the festival held in Judah, and offered sacrifices on the altar. This he did in Bethel, sacrificing to the calves he had made. And at Bethel he also installed priests at the high places he had made. "
"10791","1 Kings","12","33","On the fifteenth day of the eighth month, a month of his own choosing, he offered sacrifices on the altar he had built at Bethel. So he instituted the festival for the Israelites and went up to the altar to make offerings."
"10792","1 Kings","13","1","By the word of the Lord a man of God came from Judah to Bethel, as Jeroboam was standing by the altar to make an offering. "
"10793","1 Kings","13","2","By the word of the Lord he cried out against the altar: “Altar, altar! This is what the Lord says: ‘A son named Josiah will be born to the house of David. On you he will sacrifice the priests of the high places who make offerings here, and human bones will be burned on you.’ ” "
"10794","1 Kings","13","3","That same day the man of God gave a sign: “This is the sign the Lord has declared: The altar will be split apart and the ashes on it will be poured out.”"
"10795","1 Kings","13","4","When King Jeroboam heard what the man of God cried out against the altar at Bethel, he stretched out his hand from the altar and said, “Seize him!” But the hand he stretched out toward the man shriveled up, so that he could not pull it back. "
"10796","1 Kings","13","5","Also, the altar was split apart and its ashes poured out according to the sign given by the man of God by the word of the Lord."
"10797","1 Kings","13","6","Then the king said to the man of God, “Intercede with the Lord your God and pray for me that my hand may be restored.” So the man of God interceded with the Lord, and the king’s hand was restored and became as it was before."
"10798","1 Kings","13","7","The king said to the man of God, “Come home with me for a meal, and I will give you a gift.”"
"10799","1 Kings","13","8","But the man of God answered the king, “Even if you were to give me half your possessions, I would not go with you, nor would I eat bread or drink water here. "
"10800","1 Kings","13","9","For I was commanded by the word of the Lord: ‘You must not eat bread or drink water or return by the way you came.’ ” "
"10801","1 Kings","13","10","So he took another road and did not return by the way he had come to Bethel."
"10802","1 Kings","13","11","Now there was a certain old prophet living in Bethel, whose sons came and told him all that the man of God had done there that day. They also told their father what he had said to the king. "
"10803","1 Kings","13","12","Their father asked them, “Which way did he go?” And his sons showed him which road the man of God from Judah had taken. "
"10804","1 Kings","13","13","So he said to his sons, “Saddle the donkey for me.” And when they had saddled the donkey for him, he mounted it "
"10805","1 Kings","13","14","and rode after the man of God. He found him sitting under an oak tree and asked, “Are you the man of God who came from Judah?”“I am,” he replied."
"10806","1 Kings","13","15","So the prophet said to him, “Come home with me and eat.”"
"10807","1 Kings","13","16","The man of God said, “I cannot turn back and go with you, nor can I eat bread or drink water with you in this place. "
"10808","1 Kings","13","17","I have been told by the word of the Lord: ‘You must not eat bread or drink water there or return by the way you came.’ ”"
"10809","1 Kings","13","18","The old prophet answered, “I too am a prophet, as you are. And an angel said to me by the word of the Lord: ‘Bring him back with you to your house so that he may eat bread and drink water.’ ” (But he was lying to him.) "
"10810","1 Kings","13","19","So the man of God returned with him and ate and drank in his house."
"10811","1 Kings","13","20","While they were sitting at the table, the word of the Lord came to the old prophet who had brought him back. "
"10812","1 Kings","13","21","He cried out to the man of God who had come from Judah, “This is what the Lord says: ‘You have defied the word of the Lord and have not kept the command the Lord your God gave you. "
"10813","1 Kings","13","22","You came back and ate bread and drank water in the place where he told you not to eat or drink. Therefore your body will not be buried in the tomb of your ancestors.’ ”"
"10814","1 Kings","13","23","When the man of God had finished eating and drinking, the prophet who had brought him back saddled his donkey for him. "
"10815","1 Kings","13","24","As he went on his way, a lion met him on the road and killed him, and his body was left lying on the road, with both the donkey and the lion standing beside it. "
"10816","1 Kings","13","25","Some people who passed by saw the body lying there, with the lion standing beside the body, and they went and reported it in the city where the old prophet lived."
"10817","1 Kings","13","26","When the prophet who had brought him back from his journey heard of it, he said, “It is the man of God who defied the word of the Lord. The Lord has given him over to the lion, which has mauled him and killed him, as the word of the Lord had warned him.”"
"10818","1 Kings","13","27","The prophet said to his sons, “Saddle the donkey for me,” and they did so. "
"10819","1 Kings","13","28","Then he went out and found the body lying on the road, with the donkey and the lion standing beside it. The lion had neither eaten the body nor mauled the donkey. "
"10820","1 Kings","13","29","So the prophet picked up the body of the man of God, laid it on the donkey, and brought it back to his own city to mourn for him and bury him. "
"10821","1 Kings","13","30","Then he laid the body in his own tomb, and they mourned over him and said, “Alas, my brother!”"
"10822","1 Kings","13","31","After burying him, he said to his sons, “When I die, bury me in the grave where the man of God is buried; lay my bones beside his bones. "
"10823","1 Kings","13","32","For the message he declared by the word of the Lord against the altar in Bethel and against all the shrines on the high places in the towns of Samaria will certainly come true.”"
"10824","1 Kings","13","33","Even after this, Jeroboam did not change his evil ways, but once more appointed priests for the high places from all sorts of people. Anyone who wanted to become a priest he consecrated for the high places. "
"10825","1 Kings","13","34","This was the sin of the house of Jeroboam that led to its downfall and to its destruction from the face of the earth."
"10826","1 Kings","14","1","At that time Abijah son of Jeroboam became ill, "
"10827","1 Kings","14","2","and Jeroboam said to his wife, “Go, disguise yourself, so you won’t be recognized as the wife of Jeroboam. Then go to Shiloh. Ahijah the prophet is there—the one who told me I would be king over this people. "
"10828","1 Kings","14","3","Take ten loaves of bread with you, some cakes and a jar of honey, and go to him. He will tell you what will happen to the boy.” "
"10829","1 Kings","14","4","So Jeroboam’s wife did what he said and went to Ahijah’s house in Shiloh.Now Ahijah could not see; his sight was gone because of his age. "
"10830","1 Kings","14","5","But the Lord had told Ahijah, “Jeroboam’s wife is coming to ask you about her son, for he is ill, and you are to give her such and such an answer. When she arrives, she will pretend to be someone else.”"
"10831","1 Kings","14","6","So when Ahijah heard the sound of her footsteps at the door, he said, “Come in, wife of Jeroboam. Why this pretense? I have been sent to you with bad news. "
"10832","1 Kings","14","7","Go, tell Jeroboam that this is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: ‘I raised you up from among the people and appointed you ruler over my people Israel. "
"10833","1 Kings","14","8","I tore the kingdom away from the house of David and gave it to you, but you have not been like my servant David, who kept my commands and followed me with all his heart, doing only what was right in my eyes. "

"10836","1 Kings","14","11","Dogs will eat those belonging to Jeroboam who die in the city, and the birds will feed on those who die in the country. The Lord has spoken!’ "
"10837","1 Kings","14","12","""As for you, go back home. When you set foot in your city, the boy will die. "
"10838","1 Kings","14","13","All Israel will mourn for him and bury him. He is the only one belonging to Jeroboam who will be buried, because he is the only one in the house of Jeroboam in whom the Lord, the God of Israel, has found anything good. "
"10839","1 Kings","14","14","""The Lord will raise up for himself a king over Israel who will cut off the family of Jeroboam. Even now this is beginning to happen.14:14 The meaning of the Hebrew for this sentence is uncertain. "
"10840","1 Kings","14","15","And the Lord will strike Israel, so that it will be like a reed swaying in the water. He will uproot Israel from this good land that he gave to their ancestors and scatter them beyond the Euphrates River, because they aroused the Lord’s anger by making Asherah poles.14:15 That is, wooden symbols of the goddess Asherah; here and elsewhere in 1 Kings "
"10841","1 Kings","14","16","And he will give Israel up because of the sins Jeroboam has committed and has caused Israel to commit.”"

"10849","1 Kings","14","24","There were even male shrine prostitutes in the land; the people engaged in all the detestable practices of the nations the Lord had driven out before the Israelites."

"10880","1 Kings","15","24","Then Asa rested with his ancestors and was buried with them in the city of his father David. And Jehoshaphat his son succeeded him as king.Nadab King of Israel"
"10881","1 Kings","15","25","Nadab son of Jeroboam became king of Israel in the second year of Asa king of Judah, and he reigned over Israel two years. "
"10882","1 Kings","15","26","He did evil in the eyes of the Lord, following the ways of his father and committing the same sin his father had caused Israel to commit."
"10883","1 Kings","15","27","Baasha son of Ahijah from the tribe of Issachar plotted against him, and he struck him down at Gibbethon, a Philistine town, while Nadab and all Israel were besieging it. "
"10884","1 Kings","15","28","Baasha killed Nadab in the third year of Asa king of Judah and succeeded him as king."
"10885","1 Kings","15","29","As soon as he began to reign, he killed Jeroboam’s whole family. He did not leave Jeroboam anyone that breathed, but destroyed them all, according to the word of the Lord given through his servant Ahijah the Shilonite. "
"10886","1 Kings","15","30","This happened because of the sins Jeroboam had committed and had caused Israel to commit, and because he aroused the anger of the Lord, the God of Israel."

"10890","1 Kings","15","34","He did evil in the eyes of the Lord, following the ways of Jeroboam and committing the same sin Jeroboam had caused Israel to commit."
"10891","1 Kings","16","1","Then the word of the Lord came to Jehu son of Hanani concerning Baasha:  "
"10892","1 Kings","16","2","""I lifted you up from the dust and appointed you ruler over my people Israel, but you followed the ways of Jeroboam and caused my people Israel to sin and to arouse my anger by their sins. "
"10893","1 Kings","16","3","So I am about to wipe out Baasha and his house, and I will make your house like that of Jeroboam son of Nebat. "
"10894","1 Kings","16","4","Dogs will eat those belonging to Baasha who die in the city, and birds will feed on those who die in the country.”"

"10896","1 Kings","16","6","Baasha rested with his ancestors and was buried in Tirzah. And Elah his son succeeded him as king."
"10897","1 Kings","16","7","Moreover, the word of the Lord came through the prophet Jehu son of Hanani to Baasha and his house, because of all the evil he had done in the eyes of the Lord, arousing his anger by the things he did, becoming like the house of Jeroboam—and also because he destroyed it.Elah King of Israel"
"10898","1 Kings","16","8","In the twenty-sixth year of Asa king of Judah, Elah son of Baasha became king of Israel, and he reigned in Tirzah two years."
"10899","1 Kings","16","9","Zimri, one of his officials, who had command of half his chariots, plotted against him. Elah was in Tirzah at the time, getting drunk in the home of Arza, the palace administrator at Tirzah. "

"10901","1 Kings","16","11","As soon as he began to reign and was seated on the throne, he killed off Baasha’s whole family. He did not spare a single male, whether relative or friend. "
"10902","1 Kings","16","12","So Zimri destroyed the whole family of Baasha, in accordance with the word of the Lord spoken against Baasha through the prophet Jehu— "
"10903","1 Kings","16","13","because of all the sins Baasha and his son Elah had committed and had caused Israel to commit, so that they aroused the anger of the Lord, the God of Israel, by their worthless idols."

"10907","1 Kings","16","17","Then Omri and all the Israelites with him withdrew from Gibbethon and laid siege to Tirzah. "
"10908","1 Kings","16","18","When Zimri saw that the city was taken, he went into the citadel of the royal palace and set the palace on fire around him. So he died, "

"10912","1 Kings","16","22","But Omri’s followers proved stronger than those of Tibni son of Ginath. So Tibni died and Omri became king."
"10913","1 Kings","16","23","In the thirty-first year of Asa king of Judah, Omri became king of Israel, and he reigned twelve years, six of them in Tirzah. "
"10914","1 Kings","16","24","He bought the hill of Samaria from Shemer for two talents16:24 That is, about 150 pounds or about 68 kilograms of silver and built a city on the hill, calling it Samaria, after Shemer, the name of the former owner of the hill."

"10919","1 Kings","16","29","In the thirty-eighth year of Asa king of Judah, Ahab son of Omri became king of Israel, and he reigned in Samaria over Israel twenty-two years. "
"10920","1 Kings","16","30","Ahab son of Omri did more evil in the eyes of the Lord than any of those before him. "
"10921","1 Kings","16","31","He not only considered it trivial to commit the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat, but he also married Jezebel daughter of Ethbaal king of the Sidonians, and began to serve Baal and worship him. "
"10922","1 Kings","16","32","He set up an altar for Baal in the temple of Baal that he built in Samaria. "
"10923","1 Kings","16","33","Ahab also made an Asherah pole and did more to arouse the anger of the Lord, the God of Israel, than did all the kings of Israel before him."
"10924","1 Kings","16","34","In Ahab’s time, Hiel of Bethel rebuilt Jericho. He laid its foundations at the cost of his firstborn son Abiram, and he set up its gates at the cost of his youngest son Segub, in accordance with the word of the Lord spoken by Joshua son of Nun."
"10925","1 Kings","17","1","Now Elijah the Tishbite, from Tishbe17:1 Or Tishbite, of the settlers in Gilead, said to Ahab, “As the Lord, the God of Israel, lives, whom I serve, there will be neither dew nor rain in the next few years except at my word.”Elijah Fed by Ravens"
"10926","1 Kings","17","2","Then the word of the Lord came to Elijah:  "
"10927","1 Kings","17","3","""Leave here, turn eastward and hide in the Kerith Ravine, east of the Jordan. "
"10928","1 Kings","17","4","You will drink from the brook, and I have directed the ravens to supply you with food there.”"
"10929","1 Kings","17","5","So he did what the Lord had told him. He went to the Kerith Ravine, east of the Jordan, and stayed there. "
"10930","1 Kings","17","6","The ravens brought him bread and meat in the morning and bread and meat in the evening, and he drank from the brook.Elijah and the Widow at Zarephath"
"10931","1 Kings","17","7","Some time later the brook dried up because there had been no rain in the land. "
"10932","1 Kings","17","8","Then the word of the Lord came to him:  "
"10933","1 Kings","17","9","""Go at once to Zarephath in the region of Sidon and stay there. I have directed a widow there to supply you with food.” "
"10934","1 Kings","17","10","So he went to Zarephath. When he came to the town gate, a widow was there gathering sticks. He called to her and asked, “Would you bring me a little water in a jar so I may have a drink?” "
"10935","1 Kings","17","11","As she was going to get it, he called, “And bring me, please, a piece of bread.” "
"10936","1 Kings","17","12","""As surely as the Lord your God lives,” she replied, “I don’t have any bread—only a handful of flour in a jar and a little olive oil in a jug. I am gathering a few sticks to take home and make a meal for myself and my son, that we may eat it—and die.”"
"10937","1 Kings","17","13","Elijah said to her, “Don’t be afraid. Go home and do as you have said. But first make a small loaf of bread for me from what you have and bring it to me, and then make something for yourself and your son. "
"10938","1 Kings","17","14","For this is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: ‘The jar of flour will not be used up and the jug of oil will not run dry until the day the Lord sends rain on the land.’ ”"
"10939","1 Kings","17","15","She went away and did as Elijah had told her. So there was food every day for Elijah and for the woman and her family. "
"10940","1 Kings","17","16","For the jar of flour was not used up and the jug of oil did not run dry, in keeping with the word of the Lord spoken by Elijah."
"10941","1 Kings","17","17","Some time later the son of the woman who owned the house became ill. He grew worse and worse, and finally stopped breathing. "
"10942","1 Kings","17","18","She said to Elijah, “What do you have against me, man of God? Did you come to remind me of my sin and kill my son?” "
"10943","1 Kings","17","19","""Give me your son,” Elijah replied. He took him from her arms, carried him to the upper room where he was staying, and laid him on his bed. "
"10944","1 Kings","17","20","Then he cried out to the Lord, “Lord my God, have you brought tragedy even on this widow I am staying with, by causing her son to die?” "
"10945","1 Kings","17","21","Then he stretched himself out on the boy three times and cried out to the Lord, “Lord my God, let this boy’s life return to him!”"
"10946","1 Kings","17","22","The Lord heard Elijah’s cry, and the boy’s life returned to him, and he lived. "
"10947","1 Kings","17","23","Elijah picked up the child and carried him down from the room into the house. He gave him to his mother and said, “Look, your son is alive!”"
"10948","1 Kings","17","24","Then the woman said to Elijah, “Now I know that you are a man of God and that the word of the Lord from your mouth is the truth.”"
"10949","1 Kings","18","1","After a long time, in the third year, the word of the Lord came to Elijah: “Go and present yourself to Ahab, and I will send rain on the land.” "
"10950","1 Kings","18","2","So Elijah went to present himself to Ahab.Now the famine was severe in Samaria, "
"10951","1 Kings","18","3","and Ahab had summoned Obadiah, his palace administrator. (Obadiah was a devout believer in the Lord. "
"10952","1 Kings","18","4","While Jezebel was killing off the Lord’s prophets, Obadiah had taken a hundred prophets and hidden them in two caves, fifty in each, and had supplied them with food and water.) "
"10953","1 Kings","18","5","Ahab had said to Obadiah, “Go through the land to all the springs and valleys. Maybe we can find some grass to keep the horses and mules alive so we will not have to kill any of our animals.” "
"10954","1 Kings","18","6","So they divided the land they were to cover, Ahab going in one direction and Obadiah in another."
"10955","1 Kings","18","7","As Obadiah was walking along, Elijah met him. Obadiah recognized him, bowed down to the ground, and said, “Is it really you, my lord Elijah?” "
"10956","1 Kings","18","8","""Yes,” he replied. “Go tell your master, ‘Elijah is here.’ ” "
"10957","1 Kings","18","9","""What have I done wrong,” asked Obadiah, “that you are handing your servant over to Ahab to be put to death? "
"10958","1 Kings","18","10","As surely as the Lord your God lives, there is not a nation or kingdom where my master has not sent someone to look for you. And whenever a nation or kingdom claimed you were not there, he made them swear they could not find you. "
"10959","1 Kings","18","11","But now you tell me to go to my master and say, ‘Elijah is here.’ "
"10960","1 Kings","18","12","I don’t know where the Spirit of the Lord may carry you when I leave you. If I go and tell Ahab and he doesn’t find you, he will kill me. Yet I your servant have worshiped the Lord since my youth. "
"10961","1 Kings","18","13","Haven’t you heard, my lord, what I did while Jezebel was killing the prophets of the Lord? I hid a hundred of the Lord’s prophets in two caves, fifty in each, and supplied them with food and water. "
"10962","1 Kings","18","14","And now you tell me to go to my master and say, ‘Elijah is here.’ He will kill me!”"
"10963","1 Kings","18","15","Elijah said, “As the Lord Almighty lives, whom I serve, I will surely present myself to Ahab today.”Elijah on Mount Carmel"
"10964","1 Kings","18","16","So Obadiah went to meet Ahab and told him, and Ahab went to meet Elijah. "
"10965","1 Kings","18","17","When he saw Elijah, he said to him, “Is that you, you troubler of Israel?” "
"10966","1 Kings","18","18","""I have not made trouble for Israel,” Elijah replied. “But you and your father’s family have. You have abandoned the Lord’s commands and have followed the Baals. "
"10967","1 Kings","18","19","Now summon the people from all over Israel to meet me on Mount Carmel. And bring the four hundred and fifty prophets of Baal and the four hundred prophets of Asherah, who eat at Jezebel’s table.”"
"10968","1 Kings","18","20","So Ahab sent word throughout all Israel and assembled the prophets on Mount Carmel. "
"10969","1 Kings","18","21","Elijah went before the people and said, “How long will you waver between two opinions? If the Lord is God, follow him; but if Baal is God, follow him.”But the people said nothing."
"10970","1 Kings","18","22","Then Elijah said to them, “I am the only one of the Lord’s prophets left, but Baal has four hundred and fifty prophets. "
"10971","1 Kings","18","23","Get two bulls for us. Let Baal’s prophets choose one for themselves, and let them cut it into pieces and put it on the wood but not set fire to it. I will prepare the other bull and put it on the wood but not set fire to it. "
"10972","1 Kings","18","24","Then you call on the name of your god, and I will call on the name of the Lord. The god who answers by fire—he is God.”Then all the people said, “What you say is good.”"
"10973","1 Kings","18","25","Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, “Choose one of the bulls and prepare it first, since there are so many of you. Call on the name of your god, but do not light the fire.” "
"10974","1 Kings","18","26","So they took the bull given them and prepared it.Then they called on the name of Baal from morning till noon. “Baal, answer us!” they shouted. But there was no response; no one answered. And they danced around the altar they had made."
"10975","1 Kings","18","27","At noon Elijah began to taunt them. “Shout louder!” he said. “Surely he is a god! Perhaps he is deep in thought, or busy, or traveling. Maybe he is sleeping and must be awakened.” "
"10976","1 Kings","18","28","So they shouted louder and slashed themselves with swords and spears, as was their custom, until their blood flowed. "
"10977","1 Kings","18","29","Midday passed, and they continued their frantic prophesying until the time for the evening sacrifice. But there was no response, no one answered, no one paid attention."
"10978","1 Kings","18","30","Then Elijah said to all the people, “Come here to me.” They came to him, and he repaired the altar of the Lord, which had been torn down. "
"10979","1 Kings","18","31","Elijah took twelve stones, one for each of the tribes descended from Jacob, to whom the word of the Lord had come, saying, “Your name shall be Israel.” "
"10980","1 Kings","18","32","With the stones he built an altar in the name of the Lord, and he dug a trench around it large enough to hold two seahs18:32 That is, probably about 24 pounds or about 11 kilograms of seed. "
"10981","1 Kings","18","33","He arranged the wood, cut the bull into pieces and laid it on the wood. Then he said to them, “Fill four large jars with water and pour it on the offering and on the wood.” "
"10982","1 Kings","18","34","""Do it again,” he said, and they did it again.“Do it a third time,” he ordered, and they did it the third time. "
"10983","1 Kings","18","35","The water ran down around the altar and even filled the trench."
"10984","1 Kings","18","36","At the time of sacrifice, the prophet Elijah stepped forward and prayed: “Lord, the God of Abraham, Isaac and Israel, let it be known today that you are God in Israel and that I am your servant and have done all these things at your command. "
"10985","1 Kings","18","37","Answer me, Lord, answer me, so these people will know that you, Lord, are God, and that you are turning their hearts back again.”"
"10986","1 Kings","18","38","Then the fire of the Lord fell and burned up the sacrifice, the wood, the stones and the soil, and also licked up the water in the trench."
"10987","1 Kings","18","39","When all the people saw this, they fell prostrate and cried, “The Lord—he is God! The Lord—he is God!”"
"10988","1 Kings","18","40","Then Elijah commanded them, “Seize the prophets of Baal. Don’t let anyone get away!” They seized them, and Elijah had them brought down to the Kishon Valley and slaughtered there."
"10989","1 Kings","18","41","And Elijah said to Ahab, “Go, eat and drink, for there is the sound of a heavy rain.” "
"10990","1 Kings","18","42","So Ahab went off to eat and drink, but Elijah climbed to the top of Carmel, bent down to the ground and put his face between his knees. "
"10991","1 Kings","18","43","""Go and look toward the sea,” he told his servant. And he went up and looked.“There is nothing there,” he said.Seven times Elijah said, “Go back.”"
"10992","1 Kings","18","44","The seventh time the servant reported, “A cloud as small as a man’s hand is rising from the sea.”So Elijah said, “Go and tell Ahab, ‘Hitch up your chariot and go down before the rain stops you.’ ”"
"10993","1 Kings","18","45","Meanwhile, the sky grew black with clouds, the wind rose, a heavy rain started falling and Ahab rode off to Jezreel. "
"10994","1 Kings","18","46","The power of the Lord came on Elijah and, tucking his cloak into his belt, he ran ahead of Ahab all the way to Jezreel."
"10995","1 Kings","19","1","Now Ahab told Jezebel everything Elijah had done and how he had killed all the prophets with the sword. "
"10996","1 Kings","19","2","So Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah to say, “May the gods deal with me, be it ever so severely, if by this time tomorrow I do not make your life like that of one of them.”"
"10997","1 Kings","19","3","Elijah was afraid19:3 Or Elijah saw and ran for his life. When he came to Beersheba in Judah, he left his servant there, "
"10998","1 Kings","19","4","while he himself went a day’s journey into the wilderness. He came to a broom bush, sat down under it and prayed that he might die. “I have had enough, Lord,” he said. “Take my life; I am no better than my ancestors.” "
"10999","1 Kings","19","5","Then he lay down under the bush and fell asleep.All at once an angel touched him and said, “Get up and eat.” "
"11000","1 Kings","19","6","He looked around, and there by his head was some bread baked over hot coals, and a jar of water. He ate and drank and then lay down again."
"11001","1 Kings","19","7","The angel of the Lord came back a second time and touched him and said, “Get up and eat, for the journey is too much for you.” "
"11002","1 Kings","19","8","So he got up and ate and drank. Strengthened by that food, he traveled forty days and forty nights until he reached Horeb, the mountain of God. "
"11003","1 Kings","19","9","There he went into a cave and spent the night.The Lord Appears to ElijahAnd the word of the Lord came to him: “What are you doing here, Elijah?”"
"11004","1 Kings","19","10","He replied, “I have been very zealous for the Lord God Almighty. The Israelites have rejected your covenant, torn down your altars, and put your prophets to death with the sword. I am the only one left, and now they are trying to kill me too.”"
"11005","1 Kings","19","11","The Lord said, “Go out and stand on the mountain in the presence of the Lord, for the Lord is about to pass by.”Then a great and powerful wind tore the mountains apart and shattered the rocks before the Lord, but the Lord was not in the wind. After the wind there was an earthquake, but the Lord was not in the earthquake. "
"11006","1 Kings","19","12","After the earthquake came a fire, but the Lord was not in the fire. And after the fire came a gentle whisper. "
"11007","1 Kings","19","13","When Elijah heard it, he pulled his cloak over his face and went out and stood at the mouth of the cave.Then a voice said to him, “What are you doing here, Elijah?”"
"11008","1 Kings","19","14","He replied, “I have been very zealous for the Lord God Almighty. The Israelites have rejected your covenant, torn down your altars, and put your prophets to death with the sword. I am the only one left, and now they are trying to kill me too.”"
"11009","1 Kings","19","15","The Lord said to him, “Go back the way you came, and go to the Desert of Damascus. When you get there, anoint Hazael king over Aram. "
"11010","1 Kings","19","16","Also, anoint Jehu son of Nimshi king over Israel, and anoint Elisha son of Shaphat from Abel Meholah to succeed you as prophet. "
"11011","1 Kings","19","17","Jehu will put to death any who escape the sword of Hazael, and Elisha will put to death any who escape the sword of Jehu. "
"11012","1 Kings","19","18","Yet I reserve seven thousand in Israel—all whose knees have not bowed down to Baal and whose mouths have not kissed him.”The Call of Elisha"
"11013","1 Kings","19","19","So Elijah went from there and found Elisha son of Shaphat. He was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen, and he himself was driving the twelfth pair. Elijah went up to him and threw his cloak around him. "
"11014","1 Kings","19","20","Elisha then left his oxen and ran after Elijah. “Let me kiss my father and mother goodbye,” he said, “and then I will come with you.”“Go back,” Elijah replied. “What have I done to you?”"
"11015","1 Kings","19","21","So Elisha left him and went back. He took his yoke of oxen and slaughtered them. He burned the plowing equipment to cook the meat and gave it to the people, and they ate. Then he set out to follow Elijah and became his servant."
"11016","1 Kings","20","1","Now Ben-Hadad king of Aram mustered his entire army. Accompanied by thirty-two kings with their horses and chariots, he went up and besieged Samaria and attacked it. "
"11017","1 Kings","20","2","He sent messengers into the city to Ahab king of Israel, saying, “This is what Ben-Hadad says: 3‘Your silver and gold are mine, and the best of your wives and children are mine.’ ”"
"11018","1 Kings","20","4","The king of Israel answered, “Just as you say, my lord the king. I and all I have are yours.”"
"11019","1 Kings","20","5","The messengers came again and said, “This is what Ben-Hadad says: ‘I sent to demand your silver and gold, your wives and your children. "
"11020","1 Kings","20","6","But about this time tomorrow I am going to send my officials to search your palace and the houses of your officials. They will seize everything you value and carry it away.’ ”"
"11021","1 Kings","20","7","The king of Israel summoned all the elders of the land and said to them, “See how this man is looking for trouble! When he sent for my wives and my children, my silver and my gold, I did not refuse him.”"
"11022","1 Kings","20","8","The elders and the people all answered, “Don’t listen to him or agree to his demands.”"
"11023","1 Kings","20","9","So he replied to Ben-Hadad’s messengers, “Tell my lord the king, ‘Your servant will do all you demanded the first time, but this demand I cannot meet.’ ” They left and took the answer back to Ben-Hadad."
"11024","1 Kings","20","10","Then Ben-Hadad sent another message to Ahab: “May the gods deal with me, be it ever so severely, if enough dust remains in Samaria to give each of my men a handful.”"
"11025","1 Kings","20","11","The king of Israel answered, “Tell him: ‘One who puts on his armor should not boast like one who takes it off.’ ”"
"11026","1 Kings","20","12","Ben-Hadad heard this message while he and the kings were drinking in their tents,20:12 Or in Sukkoth; also in verse 16 and he ordered his men: “Prepare to attack.” So they prepared to attack the city.Ahab Defeats Ben-Hadad"
"11027","1 Kings","20","13","Meanwhile a prophet came to Ahab king of Israel and announced, “This is what the Lord says: ‘Do you see this vast army? I will give it into your hand today, and then you will know that I am the Lord.’ ” "
"11028","1 Kings","20","14","""But who will do this?” asked Ahab.The prophet replied, “This is what the Lord says: ‘The junior officers under the provincial commanders will do it.’ ”“And who will start the battle?” he asked.The prophet answered, “You will.”"
"11029","1 Kings","20","15","So Ahab summoned the 232 junior officers under the provincial commanders. Then he assembled the rest of the Israelites, 7,000 in all. "
"11030","1 Kings","20","16","They set out at noon while Ben-Hadad and the 32 kings allied with him were in their tents getting drunk. "
"11031","1 Kings","20","17","The junior officers under the provincial commanders went out first.Now Ben-Hadad had dispatched scouts, who reported, “Men are advancing from Samaria.”"
"11032","1 Kings","20","18","He said, “If they have come out for peace, take them alive; if they have come out for war, take them alive.”"
"11033","1 Kings","20","19","The junior officers under the provincial commanders marched out of the city with the army behind them "
"11034","1 Kings","20","20","and each one struck down his opponent. At that, the Arameans fled, with the Israelites in pursuit. But Ben-Hadad king of Aram escaped on horseback with some of his horsemen. "
"11035","1 Kings","20","21","The king of Israel advanced and overpowered the horses and chariots and inflicted heavy losses on the Arameans."
"11036","1 Kings","20","22","Afterward, the prophet came to the king of Israel and said, “Strengthen your position and see what must be done, because next spring the king of Aram will attack you again.”"
"11037","1 Kings","20","23","Meanwhile, the officials of the king of Aram advised him, “Their gods are gods of the hills. That is why they were too strong for us. But if we fight them on the plains, surely we will be stronger than they. "
"11038","1 Kings","20","24","Do this: Remove all the kings from their commands and replace them with other officers. "
"11039","1 Kings","20","25","You must also raise an army like the one you lost—horse for horse and chariot for chariot—so we can fight Israel on the plains. Then surely we will be stronger than they.” He agreed with them and acted accordingly."
"11040","1 Kings","20","26","The next spring Ben-Hadad mustered the Arameans and went up to Aphek to fight against Israel. "
"11041","1 Kings","20","27","When the Israelites were also mustered and given provisions, they marched out to meet them. The Israelites camped opposite them like two small flocks of goats, while the Arameans covered the countryside."
"11042","1 Kings","20","28","The man of God came up and told the king of Israel, “This is what the Lord says: ‘Because the Arameans think the Lord is a god of the hills and not a god of the valleys, I will deliver this vast army into your hands, and you will know that I am the Lord.’ ”"
"11043","1 Kings","20","29","For seven days they camped opposite each other, and on the seventh day the battle was joined. The Israelites inflicted a hundred thousand casualties on the Aramean foot soldiers in one day. "
"11044","1 Kings","20","30","The rest of them escaped to the city of Aphek, where the wall collapsed on twenty-seven thousand of them. And Ben-Hadad fled to the city and hid in an inner room."
"11045","1 Kings","20","31","His officials said to him, “Look, we have heard that the kings of Israel are merciful. Let us go to the king of Israel with sackcloth around our waists and ropes around our heads. Perhaps he will spare your life.”"
"11046","1 Kings","20","32","Wearing sackcloth around their waists and ropes around their heads, they went to the king of Israel and said, “Your servant Ben-Hadad says: ‘Please let me live.’ ”The king answered, “Is he still alive? He is my brother.”"
"11047","1 Kings","20","33","The men took this as a good sign and were quick to pick up his word. “Yes, your brother Ben-Hadad!” they said.“Go and get him,” the king said. When Ben-Hadad came out, Ahab had him come up into his chariot. "
"11048","1 Kings","20","34","""I will return the cities my father took from your father,” Ben-Hadad offered. “You may set up your own market areas in Damascus, as my father did in Samaria.”Ahab said, “On the basis of a treaty I will set you free.” So he made a treaty with him, and let him go.A Prophet Condemns Ahab"
"11049","1 Kings","20","35","By the word of the Lord one of the company of the prophets said to his companion, “Strike me with your weapon,” but he refused."
"11050","1 Kings","20","36","So the prophet said, “Because you have not obeyed the Lord, as soon as you leave me a lion will kill you.” And after the man went away, a lion found him and killed him."
"11051","1 Kings","20","37","The prophet found another man and said, “Strike me, please.” So the man struck him and wounded him. "
"11052","1 Kings","20","38","Then the prophet went and stood by the road waiting for the king. He disguised himself with his headband down over his eyes. "
"11053","1 Kings","20","39","As the king passed by, the prophet called out to him, “Your servant went into the thick of the battle, and someone came to me with a captive and said, ‘Guard this man. If he is missing, it will be your life for his life, or you must pay a talent20:39 That is, about 75 pounds or about 34 kilograms of silver.’ "
"11054","1 Kings","20","40","While your servant was busy here and there, the man disappeared.”“That is your sentence,” the king of Israel said. “You have pronounced it yourself.”"
"11055","1 Kings","20","41","Then the prophet quickly removed the headband from his eyes, and the king of Israel recognized him as one of the prophets. "
"11056","1 Kings","20","42","He said to the king, “This is what the Lord says: ‘You have set free a man I had determined should die.20:42 The Hebrew term refers to the irrevocable giving over of things or persons to the Lord, often by totally destroying them. Therefore it is your life for his life, your people for his people.’ ” "
"11057","1 Kings","20","43","Sullen and angry, the king of Israel went to his palace in Samaria."
"11058","1 Kings","21","1","Some time later there was an incident involving a vineyard belonging to Naboth the Jezreelite. The vineyard was in Jezreel, close to the palace of Ahab king of Samaria. "
"11059","1 Kings","21","2","Ahab said to Naboth, “Let me have your vineyard to use for a vegetable garden, since it is close to my palace. In exchange I will give you a better vineyard or, if you prefer, I will pay you whatever it is worth.”"
"11060","1 Kings","21","3","But Naboth replied, “The Lord forbid that I should give you the inheritance of my ancestors.”"
"11061","1 Kings","21","4","So Ahab went home, sullen and angry because Naboth the Jezreelite had said, “I will not give you the inheritance of my ancestors.” He lay on his bed sulking and refused to eat."
"11062","1 Kings","21","5","His wife Jezebel came in and asked him, “Why are you so sullen? Why won’t you eat?”"
"11063","1 Kings","21","6","He answered her, “Because I said to Naboth the Jezreelite, ‘Sell me your vineyard; or if you prefer, I will give you another vineyard in its place.’ But he said, ‘I will not give you my vineyard.’ ”"
"11064","1 Kings","21","7","Jezebel his wife said, “Is this how you act as king over Israel? Get up and eat! Cheer up. I’ll get you the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.”"
"11065","1 Kings","21","8","So she wrote letters in Ahab’s name, placed his seal on them, and sent them to the elders and nobles who lived in Naboth’s city with him. "
"11066","1 Kings","21","9","In those letters she wrote:“Proclaim a day of fasting and seat Naboth in a prominent place among the people. "
"11067","1 Kings","21","10","But seat two scoundrels opposite him and have them bring charges that he has cursed both God and the king. Then take him out and stone him to death.”"
"11068","1 Kings","21","11","So the elders and nobles who lived in Naboth’s city did as Jezebel directed in the letters she had written to them. "
"11069","1 Kings","21","12","They proclaimed a fast and seated Naboth in a prominent place among the people. "
"11070","1 Kings","21","13","Then two scoundrels came and sat opposite him and brought charges against Naboth before the people, saying, “Naboth has cursed both God and the king.” So they took him outside the city and stoned him to death. "
"11071","1 Kings","21","14","Then they sent word to Jezebel: “Naboth has been stoned to death.”"
"11072","1 Kings","21","15","As soon as Jezebel heard that Naboth had been stoned to death, she said to Ahab, “Get up and take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite that he refused to sell you. He is no longer alive, but dead.” "
"11073","1 Kings","21","16","When Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, he got up and went down to take possession of Naboth’s vineyard."
"11074","1 Kings","21","17","Then the word of the Lord came to Elijah the Tishbite:  "
"11075","1 Kings","21","18","""Go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, who rules in Samaria. He is now in Naboth’s vineyard, where he has gone to take possession of it. "
"11076","1 Kings","21","19","Say to him, ‘This is what the Lord says: Have you not murdered a man and seized his property?’ Then say to him, ‘This is what the Lord says: In the place where dogs licked up Naboth’s blood, dogs will lick up your blood—yes, yours!’ ”"
"11077","1 Kings","21","20","Ahab said to Elijah, “So you have found me, my enemy!”“I have found you,” he answered, “because you have sold yourself to do evil in the eyes of the Lord. "
"11078","1 Kings","21","21","He says, ‘I am going to bring disaster on you. I will wipe out your descendants and cut off from Ahab every last male in Israel—slave or free.21:21 Or Israel—every ruler or leader "
"11079","1 Kings","21","22","I will make your house like that of Jeroboam son of Nebat and that of Baasha son of Ahijah, because you have aroused my anger and have caused Israel to sin.’ "
"11080","1 Kings","21","23","""And also concerning Jezebel the Lord says: ‘Dogs will devour Jezebel by the wall of21:23 Most Hebrew manuscripts; a few Hebrew manuscripts, Vulgate and Syriac (see also 2 Kings 9:26) the plot of ground at Jezreel.’ "
"11081","1 Kings","21","24","""Dogs will eat those belonging to Ahab who die in the city, and the birds will feed on those who die in the country.”25(There was never anyone like Ahab, who sold himself to do evil in the eyes of the Lord, urged on by Jezebel his wife. "
"11082","1 Kings","21","26","He behaved in the vilest manner by going after idols, like the Amorites the Lord drove out before Israel.)"
"11083","1 Kings","21","27","When Ahab heard these words, he tore his clothes, put on sackcloth and fasted. He lay in sackcloth and went around meekly."
"11084","1 Kings","21","28","Then the word of the Lord came to Elijah the Tishbite:  "
"11085","1 Kings","21","29","""Have you noticed how Ahab has humbled himself before me? Because he has humbled himself, I will not bring this disaster in his day, but I will bring it on his house in the days of his son.”"
"11086","1 Kings","22","1","For three years there was no war between Aram and Israel. "
"11087","1 Kings","22","2","But in the third year Jehoshaphat king of Judah went down to see the king of Israel. "
"11088","1 Kings","22","3","The king of Israel had said to his officials, “Don’t you know that Ramoth Gilead belongs to us and yet we are doing nothing to retake it from the king of Aram?”"
"11089","1 Kings","22","4","So he asked Jehoshaphat, “Will you go with me to fight against Ramoth Gilead?”Jehoshaphat replied to the king of Israel, “I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses.” "
"11090","1 Kings","22","5","But Jehoshaphat also said to the king of Israel, “First seek the counsel of the Lord.”"
"11091","1 Kings","22","6","So the king of Israel brought together the prophets—about four hundred men—and asked them, “Shall I go to war against Ramoth Gilead, or shall I refrain?”“Go,” they answered, “for the Lord will give it into the king’s hand.”"
"11092","1 Kings","22","7","But Jehoshaphat asked, “Is there no longer a prophet of the Lord here whom we can inquire of?”"
"11093","1 Kings","22","8","The king of Israel answered Jehoshaphat, “There is still one prophet through whom we can inquire of the Lord, but I hate him because he never prophesies anything good about me, but always bad. He is Micaiah son of Imlah.”“The king should not say such a thing,” Jehoshaphat replied."
"11094","1 Kings","22","9","So the king of Israel called one of his officials and said, “Bring Micaiah son of Imlah at once.”"
"11095","1 Kings","22","10","Dressed in their royal robes, the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah were sitting on their thrones at the threshing floor by the entrance of the gate of Samaria, with all the prophets prophesying before them. "
"11096","1 Kings","22","11","Now Zedekiah son of Kenaanah had made iron horns and he declared, “This is what the Lord says: ‘With these you will gore the Arameans until they are destroyed.’ ”"
"11097","1 Kings","22","12","All the other prophets were prophesying the same thing. “Attack Ramoth Gilead and be victorious,” they said, “for the Lord will give it into the king’s hand.”"
"11098","1 Kings","22","13","The messenger who had gone to summon Micaiah said to him, “Look, the other prophets without exception are predicting success for the king. Let your word agree with theirs, and speak favorably.”"
"11099","1 Kings","22","14","But Micaiah said, “As surely as the Lord lives, I can tell him only what the Lord tells me.”"
"11100","1 Kings","22","15","When he arrived, the king asked him, “Micaiah, shall we go to war against Ramoth Gilead, or not?”“Attack and be victorious,” he answered, “for the Lord will give it into the king’s hand.”"
"11101","1 Kings","22","16","The king said to him, “How many times must I make you swear to tell me nothing but the truth in the name of the Lord?”"
"11102","1 Kings","22","17","Then Micaiah answered, “I saw all Israel scattered on the hills like sheep without a shepherd, and the Lord said, ‘These people have no master. Let each one go home in peace.’ ”"
"11103","1 Kings","22","18","The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “Didn’t I tell you that he never prophesies anything good about me, but only bad?”"
"11104","1 Kings","22","19","Micaiah continued, “Therefore hear the word of the Lord: I saw the Lord sitting on his throne with all the multitudes of heaven standing around him on his right and on his left. "
"11105","1 Kings","22","20","And the Lord said, ‘Who will entice Ahab into attacking Ramoth Gilead and going to his death there?’“One suggested this, and another that. "
"11106","1 Kings","22","21","Finally, a spirit came forward, stood before the Lord and said, ‘I will entice him.’ "
"11107","1 Kings","22","22",""" ‘By what means?’ the Lord asked.“ ‘I will go out and be a deceiving spirit in the mouths of all his prophets,’ he said.“ ‘You will succeed in enticing him,’ said the Lord. ‘Go and do it.’ "
"11108","1 Kings","22","23","""So now the Lord has put a deceiving spirit in the mouths of all these prophets of yours. The Lord has decreed disaster for you.”"
"11109","1 Kings","22","24","Then Zedekiah son of Kenaanah went up and slapped Micaiah in the face. “Which way did the spirit from22:24 Or Spirit of the Lord go when he went from me to speak to you?” he asked."
"11110","1 Kings","22","25","Micaiah replied, “You will find out on the day you go to hide in an inner room.”"
"11111","1 Kings","22","26","The king of Israel then ordered, “Take Micaiah and send him back to Amon the ruler of the city and to Joash the king’s son "
"11112","1 Kings","22","27","and say, ‘This is what the king says: Put this fellow in prison and give him nothing but bread and water until I return safely.’ ”"
"11113","1 Kings","22","28","Micaiah declared, “If you ever return safely, the Lord has not spoken through me.” Then he added, “Mark my words, all you people!”Ahab Killed at Ramoth Gilead"
"11114","1 Kings","22","29","So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah went up to Ramoth Gilead. "
"11115","1 Kings","22","30","The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “I will enter the battle in disguise, but you wear your royal robes.” So the king of Israel disguised himself and went into battle."
"11116","1 Kings","22","31","Now the king of Aram had ordered his thirty-two chariot commanders, “Do not fight with anyone, small or great, except the king of Israel.” "
"11117","1 Kings","22","32","When the chariot commanders saw Jehoshaphat, they thought, “Surely this is the king of Israel.” So they turned to attack him, but when Jehoshaphat cried out, "
"11118","1 Kings","22","33","the chariot commanders saw that he was not the king of Israel and stopped pursuing him."
"11119","1 Kings","22","34","But someone drew his bow at random and hit the king of Israel between the sections of his armor. The king told his chariot driver, “Wheel around and get me out of the fighting. I’ve been wounded.” "
"11120","1 Kings","22","35","All day long the battle raged, and the king was propped up in his chariot facing the Arameans. The blood from his wound ran onto the floor of the chariot, and that evening he died. "
"11121","1 Kings","22","36","As the sun was setting, a cry spread through the army: “Every man to his town. Every man to his land!”"
"11122","1 Kings","22","37","So the king died and was brought to Samaria, and they buried him there. "
"11123","1 Kings","22","38","They washed the chariot at a pool in Samaria (where the prostitutes bathed),22:38 Or Samaria and cleaned the weapons and the dogs licked up his blood, as the word of the Lord had declared."
"11124","1 Kings","22","39","As for the other events of Ahab’s reign, including all he did, the palace he built and adorned with ivory, and the cities he fortified, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel? "

"11127","1 Kings","22","42","Jehoshaphat was thirty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem twenty-five years. His mother’s name was Azubah daughter of Shilhi. "
"11128","1 Kings","22","43","In everything he followed the ways of his father Asa and did not stray from them; he did what was right in the eyes of the Lord. The high places, however, were not removed, and the people continued to offer sacrifices and burn incense there.22:43 In Hebrew texts this sentence (22:"
"11129","1 Kings","22","43","b) is numbered 22:44, and 22:44-53 is numbered 22:45-54. "
"11130","1 Kings","22","44","Jehoshaphat was also at peace with the king of Israel."

"11132","1 Kings","22","46","He rid the land of the rest of the male shrine prostitutes who remained there even after the reign of his father Asa. "
"11133","1 Kings","22","47","There was then no king in Edom; a provincial governor ruled."
"11134","1 Kings","22","48","Now Jehoshaphat built a fleet of trading ships22:48 Hebrew of ships of Tarshish to go to Ophir for gold, but they never set sail—they were wrecked at Ezion Geber. "
"11135","1 Kings","22","49","At that time Ahaziah son of Ahab said to Jehoshaphat, “Let my men sail with yours,” but Jehoshaphat refused."

"11138","1 Kings","22","52","He did evil in the eyes of the Lord, because he followed the ways of his father and mother and of Jeroboam son of Nebat, who caused Israel to sin. "
"11139","1 Kings","22","53","He served and worshiped Baal and aroused the anger of the Lord, the God of Israel, just as his father had done."
"11140","2 Kings","1","1","After Ahab’s death, Moab rebelled against Israel. "
"11141","2 Kings","1","2","Now Ahaziah had fallen through the lattice of his upper room in Samaria and injured himself. So he sent messengers, saying to them, “Go and consult Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron, to see if I will recover from this injury.”"
"11142","2 Kings","1","3","But the angel of the Lord said to Elijah the Tishbite, “Go up and meet the messengers of the king of Samaria and ask them, ‘Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are going off to consult Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron?’ "

"11145","2 Kings","1","6","""A man came to meet us,” they replied. “And he said to us, ‘Go back to the king who sent you and tell him, “This is what the Lord says: Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are sending messengers to consult Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron?

"11146","2 Kings","1","7","The king asked them, “What kind of man was it who came to meet you and told you this?”"
"11147","2 Kings","1","8","They replied, “He had a garment of hair1:8 Or He was a hairy man and had a leather belt around his waist.”The king said, “That was Elijah the Tishbite.”"
"11148","2 Kings","1","9","Then he sent to Elijah a captain with his company of fifty men. The captain went up to Elijah, who was sitting on the top of a hill, and said to him, “Man of God, the king says, ‘Come down!’ ”"
"11149","2 Kings","1","10","Elijah answered the captain, “If I am a man of God, may fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty men!” Then fire fell from heaven and consumed the captain and his men."

"11156","2 Kings","1","17","So he died, according to the word of the Lord that Elijah had spoken.Because Ahaziah had no son, Joram1:17 Hebrew Jehoram, a variant of Joram succeeded him as king in the second year of Jehoram son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah. "

"11158","2 Kings","2","1","When the Lord was about to take Elijah up to heaven in a whirlwind, Elijah and Elisha were on their way from Gilgal. "

"11164","2 Kings","2","7","Fifty men from the company of the prophets went and stood at a distance, facing the place where Elijah and Elisha had stopped at the Jordan. "
"11165","2 Kings","2","8","Elijah took his cloak, rolled it up and struck the water with it. The water divided to the right and to the left, and the two of them crossed over on dry ground."
"11166","2 Kings","2","9","When they had crossed, Elijah said to Elisha, “Tell me, what can I do for you before I am taken from you?”“Let me inherit a double portion of your spirit,” Elisha replied. "
"11167","2 Kings","2","10","""You have asked a difficult thing,” Elijah said, “yet if you see me when I am taken from you, it will be yours—otherwise, it will not.”"
"11168","2 Kings","2","11","As they were walking along and talking together, suddenly a chariot of fire and horses of fire appeared and separated the two of them, and Elijah went up to heaven in a whirlwind. "
"11169","2 Kings","2","12","Elisha saw this and cried out, “My father! My father! The chariots and horsemen of Israel!” And Elisha saw him no more. Then he took hold of his garment and tore it in two."
"11170","2 Kings","2","13","Elisha then picked up Elijah’s cloak that had fallen from him and went back and stood on the bank of the Jordan. "
"11171","2 Kings","2","14","He took the cloak that had fallen from Elijah and struck the water with it. “Where now is the Lord, the God of Elijah?” he asked. When he struck the water, it divided to the right and to the left, and he crossed over."
"11172","2 Kings","2","15","The company of the prophets from Jericho, who were watching, said, “The spirit of Elijah is resting on Elisha.” And they went to meet him and bowed to the ground before him.  "
"11173","2 Kings","2","16","""Look,” they said, “we your servants have fifty able men. Let them go and look for your master. Perhaps the Spirit of the Lord has picked him up and set him down on some mountain or in some valley.”“No,” Elisha replied, “do not send them.”"
"11174","2 Kings","2","17","But they persisted until he was too embarrassed to refuse. So he said, “Send them.” And they sent fifty men, who searched for three days but did not find him. "
"11175","2 Kings","2","18","When they returned to Elisha, who was staying in Jericho, he said to them, “Didn’t I tell you not to go?”Healing of the Water"
"11176","2 Kings","2","19","The people of the city said to Elisha, “Look, our lord, this town is well situated, as you can see, but the water is bad and the land is unproductive.” "
"11177","2 Kings","2","20","""Bring me a new bowl,” he said, “and put salt in it.” So they brought it to him."
"11178","2 Kings","2","21","Then he went out to the spring and threw the salt into it, saying, “This is what the Lord says: ‘I have healed this water. Never again will it cause death or make the land unproductive.’ ” "
"11179","2 Kings","2","22","And the water has remained pure to this day, according to the word Elisha had spoken.Elisha Is Jeered"
"11180","2 Kings","2","23","From there Elisha went up to Bethel. As he was walking along the road, some boys came out of the town and jeered at him. “Get out of here, baldy!” they said. “Get out of here, baldy!” "
"11181","2 Kings","2","24","He turned around, looked at them and called down a curse on them in the name of the Lord. Then two bears came out of the woods and mauled forty-two of the boys. "
"11182","2 Kings","2","25","And he went on to Mount Carmel and from there returned to Samaria."
"11183","2 Kings","3","1","Joram3:1 Hebrew Jehoram, a variant of Joram; also in verse 6 son of Ahab became king of Israel in Samaria in the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and he reigned twelve years. "
"11184","2 Kings","3","2","He did evil in the eyes of the Lord, but not as his father and mother had done. He got rid of the sacred stone of Baal that his father had made. "
"11185","2 Kings","3","3","Nevertheless he clung to the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat, which he had caused Israel to commit; he did not turn away from them."
"11186","2 Kings","3","4","Now Mesha king of Moab raised sheep, and he had to pay the king of Israel a tribute of a hundred thousand lambs and the wool of a hundred thousand rams. "
"11187","2 Kings","3","5","But after Ahab died, the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel. "
"11188","2 Kings","3","6","So at that time King Joram set out from Samaria and mobilized all Israel. "
"11189","2 Kings","3","7","He also sent this message to Jehoshaphat king of Judah: “The king of Moab has rebelled against me. Will you go with me to fight against Moab?”“I will go with you,” he replied. “I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses.” "
"11190","2 Kings","3","8","""By what route shall we attack?” he asked.“Through the Desert of Edom,” he answered."
"11191","2 Kings","3","9","So the king of Israel set out with the king of Judah and the king of Edom. After a roundabout march of seven days, the army had no more water for themselves or for the animals with them. "
"11192","2 Kings","3","10","""What!” exclaimed the king of Israel. “Has the Lord called us three kings together only to deliver us into the hands of Moab?”"
"11193","2 Kings","3","11","But Jehoshaphat asked, “Is there no prophet of the Lord here, through whom we may inquire of the Lord?”An officer of the king of Israel answered, “Elisha son of Shaphat is here. He used to pour water on the hands of Elijah.3:11 That is, he was Elijah’s personal servant.”"
"11194","2 Kings","3","12","Jehoshaphat said, “The word of the Lord is with him.” So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him."
"11195","2 Kings","3","13","Elisha said to the king of Israel, “Why do you want to involve me? Go to the prophets of your father and the prophets of your mother.”“No,” the king of Israel answered, “because it was the Lord who called us three kings together to deliver us into the hands of Moab.”"
"11196","2 Kings","3","14","Elisha said, “As surely as the Lord Almighty lives, whom I serve, if I did not have respect for the presence of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, I would not pay any attention to you. "
"11197","2 Kings","3","15","But now bring me a harpist.”While the harpist was playing, the hand of the Lord came on Elisha "
"11198","2 Kings","3","16","and he said, “This is what the Lord says: I will fill this valley with pools of water. "
"11199","2 Kings","3","17","For this is what the Lord says: You will see neither wind nor rain, yet this valley will be filled with water, and you, your cattle and your other animals will drink. "
"11200","2 Kings","3","18","This is an easy thing in the eyes of the Lord; he will also deliver Moab into your hands. "
"11201","2 Kings","3","19","You will overthrow every fortified city and every major town. You will cut down every good tree, stop up all the springs, and ruin every good field with stones.”"
"11202","2 Kings","3","20","The next morning, about the time for offering the sacrifice, there it was—water flowing from the direction of Edom! And the land was filled with water."
"11203","2 Kings","3","21","Now all the Moabites had heard that the kings had come to fight against them; so every man, young and old, who could bear arms was called up and stationed on the border. "
"11204","2 Kings","3","22","When they got up early in the morning, the sun was shining on the water. To the Moabites across the way, the water looked red—like blood.  "
"11205","2 Kings","3","23","""That’s blood!” they said. “Those kings must have fought and slaughtered each other. Now to the plunder, Moab!”"
"11206","2 Kings","3","24","But when the Moabites came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up and fought them until they fled. And the Israelites invaded the land and slaughtered the Moabites. "
"11207","2 Kings","3","25","They destroyed the towns, and each man threw a stone on every good field until it was covered. They stopped up all the springs and cut down every good tree. Only Kir Hareseth was left with its stones in place, but men armed with slings surrounded it and attacked it."
"11208","2 Kings","3","26","When the king of Moab saw that the battle had gone against him, he took with him seven hundred swordsmen to break through to the king of Edom, but they failed. "
"11209","2 Kings","3","27","Then he took his firstborn son, who was to succeed him as king, and offered him as a sacrifice on the city wall. The fury against Israel was great; they withdrew and returned to their own land."
"11210","2 Kings","4","1","The wife of a man from the company of the prophets cried out to Elisha, “Your servant my husband is dead, and you know that he revered the Lord. But now his creditor is coming to take my two boys as his slaves.”"
"11211","2 Kings","4","2","Elisha replied to her, “How can I help you? Tell me, what do you have in your house?”“Your servant has nothing there at all,” she said, “except a small jar of olive oil.”"
"11212","2 Kings","4","3","Elisha said, “Go around and ask all your neighbors for empty jars. Don’t ask for just a few. "
"11213","2 Kings","4","4","Then go inside and shut the door behind you and your sons. Pour oil into all the jars, and as each is filled, put it to one side.”"
"11214","2 Kings","4","5","She left him and shut the door behind her and her sons. They brought the jars to her and she kept pouring. "
"11215","2 Kings","4","6","When all the jars were full, she said to her son, “Bring me another one.”But he replied, “There is not a jar left.” Then the oil stopped flowing."
"11216","2 Kings","4","7","She went and told the man of God, and he said, “Go, sell the oil and pay your debts. You and your sons can live on what is left.”The Shunammite’s Son Restored to Life"
"11217","2 Kings","4","8","One day Elisha went to Shunem. And a well-to-do woman was there, who urged him to stay for a meal. So whenever he came by, he stopped there to eat. "
"11218","2 Kings","4","9","She said to her husband, “I know that this man who often comes our way is a holy man of God. "
"11219","2 Kings","4","10","Let’s make a small room on the roof and put in it a bed and a table, a chair and a lamp for him. Then he can stay there whenever he comes to us.”"
"11220","2 Kings","4","11","One day when Elisha came, he went up to his room and lay down there. "
"11221","2 Kings","4","12","He said to his servant Gehazi, “Call the Shunammite.” So he called her, and she stood before him. "
"11222","2 Kings","4","13","Elisha said to him, “Tell her, ‘You have gone to all this trouble for us. Now what can be done for you? Can we speak on your behalf to the king or the commander of the army?’ ”She replied, “I have a home among my own people.” "
"11223","2 Kings","4","14","""What can be done for her?” Elisha asked.Gehazi said, “She has no son, and her husband is old.”"
"11224","2 Kings","4","15","Then Elisha said, “Call her.” So he called her, and she stood in the doorway.  "
"11225","2 Kings","4","16","""About this time next year,” Elisha said, “you will hold a son in your arms.”“No, my lord!” she objected. “Please, man of God, don’t mislead your servant!”"
"11226","2 Kings","4","17","But the woman became pregnant, and the next year about that same time she gave birth to a son, just as Elisha had told her."
"11227","2 Kings","4","18","The child grew, and one day he went out to his father, who was with the reapers. "
"11228","2 Kings","4","19","He said to his father, “My head! My head!”His father told a servant, “Carry him to his mother.” "
"11229","2 Kings","4","20","After the servant had lifted him up and carried him to his mother, the boy sat on her lap until noon, and then he died. "
"11230","2 Kings","4","21","She went up and laid him on the bed of the man of God, then shut the door and went out."
"11231","2 Kings","4","22","She called her husband and said, “Please send me one of the servants and a donkey so I can go to the man of God quickly and return.” "
"11232","2 Kings","4","23","""Why go to him today?” he asked. “It’s not the New Moon or the Sabbath.”“That’s all right,” she said."
"11233","2 Kings","4","24","She saddled the donkey and said to her servant, “Lead on; don’t slow down for me unless I tell you.” "
"11234","2 Kings","4","25","So she set out and came to the man of God at Mount Carmel.When he saw her in the distance, the man of God said to his servant Gehazi, “Look! There’s the Shunammite! "
"11235","2 Kings","4","26","Run to meet her and ask her, ‘Are you all right? Is your husband all right? Is your child all right?’ ”“Everything is all right,” she said."
"11236","2 Kings","4","27","When she reached the man of God at the mountain, she took hold of his feet. Gehazi came over to push her away, but the man of God said, “Leave her alone! She is in bitter distress, but the Lord has hidden it from me and has not told me why.” "
"11237","2 Kings","4","28","""Did I ask you for a son, my lord?” she said. “Didn’t I tell you, ‘Don’t raise my hopes’?”"
"11238","2 Kings","4","29","Elisha said to Gehazi, “Tuck your cloak into your belt, take my staff in your hand and run. Don’t greet anyone you meet, and if anyone greets you, do not answer. Lay my staff on the boy’s face.”"
"11239","2 Kings","4","30","But the child’s mother said, “As surely as the Lord lives and as you live, I will not leave you.” So he got up and followed her."
"11240","2 Kings","4","31","Gehazi went on ahead and laid the staff on the boy’s face, but there was no sound or response. So Gehazi went back to meet Elisha and told him, “The boy has not awakened.”"
"11241","2 Kings","4","32","When Elisha reached the house, there was the boy lying dead on his couch. "
"11242","2 Kings","4","33","He went in, shut the door on the two of them and prayed to the Lord. "
"11243","2 Kings","4","34","Then he got on the bed and lay on the boy, mouth to mouth, eyes to eyes, hands to hands. As he stretched himself out on him, the boy’s body grew warm. "
"11244","2 Kings","4","35","Elisha turned away and walked back and forth in the room and then got on the bed and stretched out on him once more. The boy sneezed seven times and opened his eyes."
"11245","2 Kings","4","36","Elisha summoned Gehazi and said, “Call the Shunammite.” And he did. When she came, he said, “Take your son.” "
"11246","2 Kings","4","37","She came in, fell at his feet and bowed to the ground. Then she took her son and went out.Death in the Pot"
"11247","2 Kings","4","38","Elisha returned to Gilgal and there was a famine in that region. While the company of the prophets was meeting with him, he said to his servant, “Put on the large pot and cook some stew for these prophets.”"
"11248","2 Kings","4","39","One of them went out into the fields to gather herbs and found a wild vine and picked as many of its gourds as his garment could hold. When he returned, he cut them up into the pot of stew, though no one knew what they were. "
"11249","2 Kings","4","40","The stew was poured out for the men, but as they began to eat it, they cried out, “Man of God, there is death in the pot!” And they could not eat it."
"11250","2 Kings","4","41","Elisha said, “Get some flour.” He put it into the pot and said, “Serve it to the people to eat.” And there was nothing harmful in the pot.Feeding of a Hundred"
"11251","2 Kings","4","42","A man came from Baal Shalishah, bringing the man of God twenty loaves of barley bread baked from the first ripe grain, along with some heads of new grain. “Give it to the people to eat,” Elisha said. "
"11252","2 Kings","4","43","""How can I set this before a hundred men?” his servant asked.But Elisha answered, “Give it to the people to eat. For this is what the Lord says: ‘They will eat and have some left over.’ ” "
"11253","2 Kings","4","44","Then he set it before them, and they ate and had some left over, according to the word of the Lord."
"11254","2 Kings","5","1","Now Naaman was commander of the army of the king of Aram. He was a great man in the sight of his master and highly regarded, because through him the Lord had given victory to Aram. He was a valiant soldier, but he had leprosy.5:1 The Hebrew for leprosy was used for various diseases affecting the skin; also in verses 3, 6, 7, 11 and 27."
"11255","2 Kings","5","2","Now bands of raiders from Aram had gone out and had taken captive a young girl from Israel, and she served Naaman’s wife. "
"11256","2 Kings","5","3","She said to her mistress, “If only my master would see the prophet who is in Samaria! He would cure him of his leprosy.”"
"11257","2 Kings","5","4","Naaman went to his master and told him what the girl from Israel had said.  "
"11258","2 Kings","5","5","""By all means, go,” the king of Aram replied. “I will send a letter to the king of Israel.” So Naaman left, taking with him ten talents5:5 That is, about 750 pounds or about 340 kilograms of silver, six thousand shekels5:5 That is, about 150 pounds or about 69 kilograms of gold and ten sets of clothing. "
"11259","2 Kings","5","6","The letter that he took to the king of Israel read: “With this letter I am sending my servant Naaman to you so that you may cure him of his leprosy.”"
"11260","2 Kings","5","7","As soon as the king of Israel read the letter, he tore his robes and said, “Am I God? Can I kill and bring back to life? Why does this fellow send someone to me to be cured of his leprosy? See how he is trying to pick a quarrel with me!”"
"11261","2 Kings","5","8","When Elisha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had torn his robes, he sent him this message: “Why have you torn your robes? Have the man come to me and he will know that there is a prophet in Israel.” "
"11262","2 Kings","5","9","So Naaman went with his horses and chariots and stopped at the door of Elisha’s house. "
"11263","2 Kings","5","10","Elisha sent a messenger to say to him, “Go, wash yourself seven times in the Jordan, and your flesh will be restored and you will be cleansed.”"
"11264","2 Kings","5","11","But Naaman went away angry and said, “I thought that he would surely come out to me and stand and call on the name of the Lord his God, wave his hand over the spot and cure me of my leprosy. "
"11265","2 Kings","5","12","Are not Abana and Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? Couldn’t I wash in them and be cleansed?” So he turned and went off in a rage."
"11266","2 Kings","5","13","Naaman’s servants went to him and said, “My father, if the prophet had told you to do some great thing, would you not have done it? How much more, then, when he tells you, ‘Wash and be cleansed’!” "
"11267","2 Kings","5","14","So he went down and dipped himself in the Jordan seven times, as the man of God had told him, and his flesh was restored and became clean like that of a young boy."
"11268","2 Kings","5","15","Then Naaman and all his attendants went back to the man of God. He stood before him and said, “Now I know that there is no God in all the world except in Israel. So please accept a gift from your servant.”"
"11269","2 Kings","5","16","The prophet answered, “As surely as the Lord lives, whom I serve, I will not accept a thing.” And even though Naaman urged him, he refused. "
"11270","2 Kings","5","17","""If you will not,” said Naaman, “please let me, your servant, be given as much earth as a pair of mules can carry, for your servant will never again make burnt offerings and sacrifices to any other god but the Lord. "
"11271","2 Kings","5","18","But may the Lord forgive your servant for this one thing: When my master enters the temple of Rimmon to bow down and he is leaning on my arm and I have to bow there also—when I bow down in the temple of Rimmon, may the Lord forgive your servant for this.” "
"11272","2 Kings","5","19","""Go in peace,” Elisha said.After Naaman had traveled some distance, "
"11273","2 Kings","5","20","Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said to himself, “My master was too easy on Naaman, this Aramean, by not accepting from him what he brought. As surely as the Lord lives, I will run after him and get something from him.”"
"11274","2 Kings","5","21","So Gehazi hurried after Naaman. When Naaman saw him running toward him, he got down from the chariot to meet him. “Is everything all right?” he asked. "
"11275","2 Kings","5","22","""Everything is all right,” Gehazi answered. “My master sent me to say, ‘Two young men from the company of the prophets have just come to me from the hill country of Ephraim. Please give them a talent5:22 That is, about 75 pounds or about 34 kilograms of silver and two sets of clothing.’ ” "
"11276","2 Kings","5","23","""By all means, take two talents,” said Naaman. He urged Gehazi to accept them, and then tied up the two talents of silver in two bags, with two sets of clothing. He gave them to two of his servants, and they carried them ahead of Gehazi. "
"11277","2 Kings","5","24","When Gehazi came to the hill, he took the things from the servants and put them away in the house. He sent the men away and they left."
"11278","2 Kings","5","25","When he went in and stood before his master, Elisha asked him, “Where have you been, Gehazi?”“Your servant didn’t go anywhere,” Gehazi answered."
"11279","2 Kings","5","26","But Elisha said to him, “Was not my spirit with you when the man got down from his chariot to meet you? Is this the time to take money or to accept clothes—or olive groves and vineyards, or flocks and herds, or male and female slaves? "
"11280","2 Kings","5","27","Naaman’s leprosy will cling to you and to your descendants forever.” Then Gehazi went from Elisha’s presence and his skin was leprous—it had become as white as snow."
"11281","2 Kings","6","1","The company of the prophets said to Elisha, “Look, the place where we meet with you is too small for us. "
"11282","2 Kings","6","2","Let us go to the Jordan, where each of us can get a pole; and let us build a place there for us to meet.”And he said, “Go.”"
"11283","2 Kings","6","3","Then one of them said, “Won’t you please come with your servants?”“I will,” Elisha replied. "
"11284","2 Kings","6","4","And he went with them.They went to the Jordan and began to cut down trees. "
"11285","2 Kings","6","5","As one of them was cutting down a tree, the iron axhead fell into the water. “Oh no, my lord!” he cried out. “It was borrowed!”"
"11286","2 Kings","6","6","The man of God asked, “Where did it fall?” When he showed him the place, Elisha cut a stick and threw it there, and made the iron float.  "
"11287","2 Kings","6","7","""Lift it out,” he said. Then the man reached out his hand and took it.Elisha Traps Blinded Arameans"
"11288","2 Kings","6","8","Now the king of Aram was at war with Israel. After conferring with his officers, he said, “I will set up my camp in such and such a place.”"
"11289","2 Kings","6","9","The man of God sent word to the king of Israel: “Beware of passing that place, because the Arameans are going down there.” "
"11290","2 Kings","6","10","So the king of Israel checked on the place indicated by the man of God. Time and again Elisha warned the king, so that he was on his guard in such places."
"11291","2 Kings","6","11","This enraged the king of Aram. He summoned his officers and demanded of them, “Tell me! Which of us is on the side of the king of Israel?” "
"11292","2 Kings","6","12","""None of us, my lord the king,” said one of his officers, “but Elisha, the prophet who is in Israel, tells the king of Israel the very words you speak in your bedroom.” "
"11293","2 Kings","6","13","""Go, find out where he is,” the king ordered, “so I can send men and capture him.” The report came back: “He is in Dothan.” "
"11294","2 Kings","6","14","Then he sent horses and chariots and a strong force there. They went by night and surrounded the city."
"11295","2 Kings","6","15","When the servant of the man of God got up and went out early the next morning, an army with horses and chariots had surrounded the city. “Oh no, my lord! What shall we do?” the servant asked. "
"11296","2 Kings","6","16","""Don’t be afraid,” the prophet answered. “Those who are with us are more than those who are with them.”"
"11297","2 Kings","6","17","And Elisha prayed, “Open his eyes, Lord, so that he may see.” Then the Lord opened the servant’s eyes, and he looked and saw the hills full of horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha."
"11298","2 Kings","6","18","As the enemy came down toward him, Elisha prayed to the Lord, “Strike this army with blindness.” So he struck them with blindness, as Elisha had asked."
"11299","2 Kings","6","19","Elisha told them, “This is not the road and this is not the city. Follow me, and I will lead you to the man you are looking for.” And he led them to Samaria."
"11300","2 Kings","6","20","After they entered the city, Elisha said, “Lord, open the eyes of these men so they can see.” Then the Lord opened their eyes and they looked, and there they were, inside Samaria."
"11301","2 Kings","6","21","When the king of Israel saw them, he asked Elisha, “Shall I kill them, my father? Shall I kill them?” "
"11302","2 Kings","6","22","""Do not kill them,” he answered. “Would you kill those you have captured with your own sword or bow? Set food and water before them so that they may eat and drink and then go back to their master.” "
"11303","2 Kings","6","23","So he prepared a great feast for them, and after they had finished eating and drinking, he sent them away, and they returned to their master. So the bands from Aram stopped raiding Israel’s territory.Famine in Besieged Samaria"
"11304","2 Kings","6","24","Some time later, Ben-Hadad king of Aram mobilized his entire army and marched up and laid siege to Samaria. "
"11305","2 Kings","6","25","There was a great famine in the city; the siege lasted so long that a donkey’s head sold for eighty shekels6:25 That is, about 2 pounds or about 920 grams of silver, and a quarter of a cab6:25 That is, probably about 1/4 pound or about 100 grams of seed pods6:25 Or of doves’ dung for five shekels.6:25 That is, about 2 ounces or about 58 grams"
"11306","2 Kings","6","26","As the king of Israel was passing by on the wall, a woman cried to him, “Help me, my lord the king!”"
"11307","2 Kings","6","27","The king replied, “If the Lord does not help you, where can I get help for you? From the threshing floor? From the winepress?” "
"11308","2 Kings","6","28","Then he asked her, “What’s the matter?”She answered, “This woman said to me, ‘Give up your son so we may eat him today, and tomorrow we’ll eat my son.’ "
"11309","2 Kings","6","29","So we cooked my son and ate him. The next day I said to her, ‘Give up your son so we may eat him,’ but she had hidden him.”"
"11310","2 Kings","6","30","When the king heard the woman’s words, he tore his robes. As he went along the wall, the people looked, and they saw that, under his robes, he had sackcloth on his body. "
"11311","2 Kings","6","31","He said, “May God deal with me, be it ever so severely, if the head of Elisha son of Shaphat remains on his shoulders today!”"
"11312","2 Kings","6","32","Now Elisha was sitting in his house, and the elders were sitting with him. The king sent a messenger ahead, but before he arrived, Elisha said to the elders, “Don’t you see how this murderer is sending someone to cut off my head? Look, when the messenger comes, shut the door and hold it shut against him. Is not the sound of his master’s footsteps behind him?” "
"11313","2 Kings","6","33","While he was still talking to them, the messenger came down to him.The king said, “This disaster is from the Lord. Why should I wait for the Lord any longer?”"
"11314","2 Kings","7","1","Elisha replied, “Hear the word of the Lord. This is what the Lord says: About this time tomorrow, a seah7:1 That is, probably about 12 pounds or about 5.5 kilograms of flour; also in verses 16 and 18 of the finest flour will sell for a shekel7:1 That is, about 2/5 ounce or about 12 grams; also in verses 16 and 18 and two seahs7:1 That is, probably about 20 pounds or about 9 kilograms of barley; also in verses 16 and 18 of barley for a shekel at the gate of Samaria.”"
"11315","2 Kings","7","2","The officer on whose arm the king was leaning said to the man of God, “Look, even if the Lord should open the floodgates of the heavens, could this happen?”“You will see it with your own eyes,” answered Elisha, “but you will not eat any of it!”The Siege Lifted"
"11316","2 Kings","7","3","Now there were four men with leprosy7:3 The Hebrew for leprosy was used for various diseases affecting the skin; also in verse 8. at the entrance of the city gate. They said to each other, “Why stay here until we die? "
"11317","2 Kings","7","4","If we say, ‘We’ll go into the city’—the famine is there, and we will die. And if we stay here, we will die. So let’s go over to the camp of the Arameans and surrender. If they spare us, we live; if they kill us, then we die.”"
"11318","2 Kings","7","5","At dusk they got up and went to the camp of the Arameans. When they reached the edge of the camp, no one was there, "
"11319","2 Kings","7","6","for the Lord had caused the Arameans to hear the sound of chariots and horses and a great army, so that they said to one another, “Look, the king of Israel has hired the Hittite and Egyptian kings to attack us!” "
"11320","2 Kings","7","7","So they got up and fled in the dusk and abandoned their tents and their horses and donkeys. They left the camp as it was and ran for their lives."
"11321","2 Kings","7","8","The men who had leprosy reached the edge of the camp, entered one of the tents and ate and drank. Then they took silver, gold and clothes, and went off and hid them. They returned and entered another tent and took some things from it and hid them also."
"11322","2 Kings","7","9","Then they said to each other, “What we’re doing is not right. This is a day of good news and we are keeping it to ourselves. If we wait until daylight, punishment will overtake us. Let’s go at once and report this to the royal palace.”"
"11323","2 Kings","7","10","So they went and called out to the city gatekeepers and told them, “We went into the Aramean camp and no one was there—not a sound of anyone—only tethered horses and donkeys, and the tents left just as they were.” "
"11324","2 Kings","7","11","The gatekeepers shouted the news, and it was reported within the palace."
"11325","2 Kings","7","12","The king got up in the night and said to his officers, “I will tell you what the Arameans have done to us. They know we are starving; so they have left the camp to hide in the countryside, thinking, ‘They will surely come out, and then we will take them alive and get into the city.’ ”"
"11326","2 Kings","7","13","One of his officers answered, “Have some men take five of the horses that are left in the city. Their plight will be like that of all the Israelites left here—yes, they will only be like all these Israelites who are doomed. So let us send them to find out what happened.”"
"11327","2 Kings","7","14","So they selected two chariots with their horses, and the king sent them after the Aramean army. He commanded the drivers, “Go and find out what has happened.” "
"11328","2 Kings","7","15","They followed them as far as the Jordan, and they found the whole road strewn with the clothing and equipment the Arameans had thrown away in their headlong flight. So the messengers returned and reported to the king. "
"11329","2 Kings","7","16","Then the people went out and plundered the camp of the Arameans. So a seah of the finest flour sold for a shekel, and two seahs of barley sold for a shekel, as the Lord had said."
"11330","2 Kings","7","17","Now the king had put the officer on whose arm he leaned in charge of the gate, and the people trampled him in the gateway, and he died, just as the man of God had foretold when the king came down to his house. "
"11331","2 Kings","7","18","It happened as the man of God had said to the king: “About this time tomorrow, a seah of the finest flour will sell for a shekel and two seahs of barley for a shekel at the gate of Samaria.”"
"11332","2 Kings","7","19","The officer had said to the man of God, “Look, even if the Lord should open the floodgates of the heavens, could this happen?” The man of God had replied, “You will see it with your own eyes, but you will not eat any of it!” "
"11333","2 Kings","7","20","And that is exactly what happened to him, for the people trampled him in the gateway, and he died."
"11334","2 Kings","8","1","Now Elisha had said to the woman whose son he had restored to life, “Go away with your family and stay for a while wherever you can, because the Lord has decreed a famine in the land that will last seven years.” "
"11335","2 Kings","8","2","The woman proceeded to do as the man of God said. She and her family went away and stayed in the land of the Philistines seven years."
"11336","2 Kings","8","3","At the end of the seven years she came back from the land of the Philistines and went to appeal to the king for her house and land. "
"11337","2 Kings","8","4","The king was talking to Gehazi, the servant of the man of God, and had said, “Tell me about all the great things Elisha has done.” "
"11338","2 Kings","8","5","Just as Gehazi was telling the king how Elisha had restored the dead to life, the woman whose son Elisha had brought back to life came to appeal to the king for her house and land.Gehazi said, “This is the woman, my lord the king, and this is her son whom Elisha restored to life.” "
"11339","2 Kings","8","6","The king asked the woman about it, and she told him.Then he assigned an official to her case and said to him, “Give back everything that belonged to her, including all the income from her land from the day she left the country until now.”Hazael Murders Ben-Hadad"
"11340","2 Kings","8","7","Elisha went to Damascus, and Ben-Hadad king of Aram was ill. When the king was told, “The man of God has come all the way up here,” "
"11341","2 Kings","8","8","he said to Hazael, “Take a gift with you and go to meet the man of God. Consult the Lord through him; ask him, ‘Will I recover from this illness?’ ”"
"11342","2 Kings","8","9","Hazael went to meet Elisha, taking with him as a gift forty camel-loads of all the finest wares of Damascus. He went in and stood before him, and said, “Your son Ben-Hadad king of Aram has sent me to ask, ‘Will I recover from this illness?’ ”"
"11343","2 Kings","8","10","Elisha answered, “Go and say to him, ‘You will certainly recover.’ Nevertheless,8:10 The Hebrew may also be read Go and say, ‘You will certainly not recover,’ for. the Lord has revealed to me that he will in fact die.” "
"11344","2 Kings","8","11","He stared at him with a fixed gaze until Hazael was embarrassed. Then the man of God began to weep. "
"11345","2 Kings","8","12","""Why is my lord weeping?” asked Hazael.“Because I know the harm you will do to the Israelites,” he answered. “You will set fire to their fortified places, kill their young men with the sword, dash their little children to the ground, and rip open their pregnant women.”"
"11346","2 Kings","8","13","Hazael said, “How could your servant, a mere dog, accomplish such a feat?”“The Lord has shown me that you will become king of Aram,” answered Elisha."
"11347","2 Kings","8","14","Then Hazael left Elisha and returned to his master. When Ben-Hadad asked, “What did Elisha say to you?” Hazael replied, “He told me that you would certainly recover.” "
"11348","2 Kings","8","15","But the next day he took a thick cloth, soaked it in water and spread it over the king’s face, so that he died. Then Hazael succeeded him as king.Jehoram King of Judah"
"11349","2 Kings","8","16","In the fifth year of Joram son of Ahab king of Israel, when Jehoshaphat was king of Judah, Jehoram son of Jehoshaphat began his reign as king of Judah. "
"11350","2 Kings","8","17","He was thirty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years. "
"11351","2 Kings","8","18","He followed the ways of the kings of Israel, as the house of Ahab had done, for he married a daughter of Ahab. He did evil in the eyes of the Lord. "
"11352","2 Kings","8","19","Nevertheless, for the sake of his servant David, the Lord was not willing to destroy Judah. He had promised to maintain a lamp for David and his descendants forever."
"11353","2 Kings","8","20","In the time of Jehoram, Edom rebelled against Judah and set up its own king. "
"11354","2 Kings","8","21","So Jehoram8:21 Hebrew Joram, a variant of Jehoram; also in verses 23 and 24 went to Zair with all his chariots. The Edomites surrounded him and his chariot commanders, but he rose up and broke through by night; his army, however, fled back home. "
"11355","2 Kings","8","22","To this day Edom has been in rebellion against Judah. Libnah revolted at the same time."
"11356","2 Kings","8","23","As for the other events of Jehoram’s reign, and all he did, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Judah? "
"11357","2 Kings","8","24","Jehoram rested with his ancestors and was buried with them in the City of David. And Ahaziah his son succeeded him as king.Ahaziah King of Judah"
"11358","2 Kings","8","25","In the twelfth year of Joram son of Ahab king of Israel, Ahaziah son of Jehoram king of Judah began to reign. "
"11359","2 Kings","8","26","Ahaziah was twenty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem one year. His mother’s name was Athaliah, a granddaughter of Omri king of Israel. "
"11360","2 Kings","8","27","He followed the ways of the house of Ahab and did evil in the eyes of the Lord, as the house of Ahab had done, for he was related by marriage to Ahab’s family."
"11361","2 Kings","8","28","Ahaziah went with Joram son of Ahab to war against Hazael king of Aram at Ramoth Gilead. The Arameans wounded Joram; "
"11362","2 Kings","8","29","so King Joram returned to Jezreel to recover from the wounds the Arameans had inflicted on him at Ramoth8:29 Hebrew Ramah, a variant of Ramoth in his battle with Hazael king of Aram.Then Ahaziah son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to Jezreel to see Joram son of Ahab, because he had been wounded."
"11363","2 Kings","9","1","The prophet Elisha summoned a man from the company of the prophets and said to him, “Tuck your cloak into your belt, take this flask of olive oil with you and go to Ramoth Gilead. "
"11364","2 Kings","9","2","When you get there, look for Jehu son of Jehoshaphat, the son of Nimshi. Go to him, get him away from his companions and take him into an inner room. "
"11365","2 Kings","9","3","Then take the flask and pour the oil on his head and declare, ‘This is what the Lord says: I anoint you king over Israel.’ Then open the door and run; don’t delay!”"
"11366","2 Kings","9","4","So the young prophet went to Ramoth Gilead. "
"11367","2 Kings","9","5","When he arrived, he found the army officers sitting together. “I have a message for you, commander,” he said.“For which of us?” asked Jehu.“For you, commander,” he replied."
"11368","2 Kings","9","6","Jehu got up and went into the house. Then the prophet poured the oil on Jehu’s head and declared, “This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: ‘I anoint you king over the Lord’s people Israel. "
"11369","2 Kings","9","7","You are to destroy the house of Ahab your master, and I will avenge the blood of my servants the prophets and the blood of all the Lord’s servants shed by Jezebel. "
"11370","2 Kings","9","8","The whole house of Ahab will perish. I will cut off from Ahab every last male in Israel—slave or free.9:8 Or Israel—every ruler or leader "
"11371","2 Kings","9","9","I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam son of Nebat and like the house of Baasha son of Ahijah. "
"11372","2 Kings","9","10","As for Jezebel, dogs will devour her on the plot of ground at Jezreel, and no one will bury her.’ ” Then he opened the door and ran."
"11373","2 Kings","9","11","When Jehu went out to his fellow officers, one of them asked him, “Is everything all right? Why did this maniac come to you?”“You know the man and the sort of things he says,” Jehu replied. "
"11374","2 Kings","9","12","""That’s not true!” they said. “Tell us.”Jehu said, “Here is what he told me: ‘This is what the Lord says: I anoint you king over Israel.’ ”"
"11375","2 Kings","9","13","They quickly took their cloaks and spread them under him on the bare steps. Then they blew the trumpet and shouted, “Jehu is king!”Jehu Kills Joram and Ahaziah"
"11376","2 Kings","9","14","So Jehu son of Jehoshaphat, the son of Nimshi, conspired against Joram. (Now Joram and all Israel had been defending Ramoth Gilead against Hazael king of Aram, "
"11377","2 Kings","9","15","but King Joram9:15 Hebrew Jehoram, a variant of Joram; also in verses 17 and 21-24 had returned to Jezreel to recover from the wounds the Arameans had inflicted on him in the battle with Hazael king of Aram.) Jehu said, “If you desire to make me king, don’t let anyone slip out of the city to go and tell the news in Jezreel.” "
"11378","2 Kings","9","16","Then he got into his chariot and rode to Jezreel, because Joram was resting there and Ahaziah king of Judah had gone down to see him."
"11379","2 Kings","9","17","When the lookout standing on the tower in Jezreel saw Jehu’s troops approaching, he called out, “I see some troops coming.”“Get a horseman,” Joram ordered. “Send him to meet them and ask, ‘Do you come in peace?’ ”"
"11380","2 Kings","9","18","The horseman rode off to meet Jehu and said, “This is what the king says: ‘Do you come in peace?’ ”“What do you have to do with peace?” Jehu replied. “Fall in behind me.”The lookout reported, “The messenger has reached them, but he isn’t coming back.”"
"11381","2 Kings","9","19","So the king sent out a second horseman. When he came to them he said, “This is what the king says: ‘Do you come in peace?’ ”Jehu replied, “What do you have to do with peace? Fall in behind me.”"
"11382","2 Kings","9","20","The lookout reported, “He has reached them, but he isn’t coming back either. The driving is like that of Jehu son of Nimshi—he drives like a maniac.” "
"11383","2 Kings","9","21","""Hitch up my chariot,” Joram ordered. And when it was hitched up, Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah rode out, each in his own chariot, to meet Jehu. They met him at the plot of ground that had belonged to Naboth the Jezreelite. "
"11384","2 Kings","9","22","When Joram saw Jehu he asked, “Have you come in peace, Jehu?”“How can there be peace,” Jehu replied, “as long as all the idolatry and witchcraft of your mother Jezebel abound?”"
"11385","2 Kings","9","23","Joram turned about and fled, calling out to Ahaziah, “Treachery, Ahaziah!”"
"11386","2 Kings","9","24","Then Jehu drew his bow and shot Joram between the shoulders. The arrow pierced his heart and he slumped down in his chariot. "
"11387","2 Kings","9","25","Jehu said to Bidkar, his chariot officer, “Pick him up and throw him on the field that belonged to Naboth the Jezreelite. Remember how you and I were riding together in chariots behind Ahab his father when the Lord spoke this prophecy against him: 26‘Yesterday I saw the blood of Naboth and the blood of his sons, declares the Lord, and I will surely make you pay for it on this plot of ground, declares the Lord.’9:26 See 1 Kings 21:19. Now then, pick him up and throw him on that plot, in accordance with the word of the Lord.”"
"11388","2 Kings","9","27","When Ahaziah king of Judah saw what had happened, he fled up the road to Beth Haggan.9:27 Or fled by way of the garden house Jehu chased him, shouting, “Kill him too!” They wounded him in his chariot on the way up to Gur near Ibleam, but he escaped to Megiddo and died there. "
"11389","2 Kings","9","28","His servants took him by chariot to Jerusalem and buried him with his ancestors in his tomb in the City of David. 29(In the eleventh year of Joram son of Ahab, Ahaziah had become king of Judah.)Jezebel Killed"
"11390","2 Kings","9","30","Then Jehu went to Jezreel. When Jezebel heard about it, she put on eye makeup, arranged her hair and looked out of a window. "
"11391","2 Kings","9","31","As Jehu entered the gate, she asked, “Have you come in peace, you Zimri, you murderer of your master?”9:31 Or “Was there peace for Zimri, who murdered his master?”"
"11392","2 Kings","9","32","He looked up at the window and called out, “Who is on my side? Who?” Two or three eunuchs looked down at him.  "
"11393","2 Kings","9","33","""Throw her down!” Jehu said. So they threw her down, and some of her blood spattered the wall and the horses as they trampled her underfoot."
"11394","2 Kings","9","34","Jehu went in and ate and drank. “Take care of that cursed woman,” he said, “and bury her, for she was a king’s daughter.” "
"11395","2 Kings","9","35","But when they went out to bury her, they found nothing except her skull, her feet and her hands. "
"11396","2 Kings","9","36","They went back and told Jehu, who said, “This is the word of the Lord that he spoke through his servant Elijah the Tishbite: On the plot of ground at Jezreel dogs will devour Jezebel’s flesh.9:36 See 1 Kings 21:23. "
"11397","2 Kings","9","37","Jezebel’s body will be like dung on the ground in the plot at Jezreel, so that no one will be able to say, ‘This is Jezebel.’ ”"
"11398","2 Kings","10","1","Now there were in Samaria seventy sons of the house of Ahab. So Jehu wrote letters and sent them to Samaria: to the officials of Jezreel,10:1 Hebrew; some Septuagint manuscripts and Vulgate of the city to the elders and to the guardians of Ahab’s children. He said,  "
"11399","2 Kings","10","2","""You have your master’s sons with you and you have chariots and horses, a fortified city and weapons. Now as soon as this letter reaches you, "
"11400","2 Kings","10","3","choose the best and most worthy of your master’s sons and set him on his father’s throne. Then fight for your master’s house.”"
"11401","2 Kings","10","4","But they were terrified and said, “If two kings could not resist him, how can we?”"
"11402","2 Kings","10","5","So the palace administrator, the city governor, the elders and the guardians sent this message to Jehu: “We are your servants and we will do anything you say. We will not appoint anyone as king; you do whatever you think best.”"
"11403","2 Kings","10","6","Then Jehu wrote them a second letter, saying, “If you are on my side and will obey me, take the heads of your master’s sons and come to me in Jezreel by this time tomorrow.”Now the royal princes, seventy of them, were with the leading men of the city, who were rearing them. "
"11404","2 Kings","10","7","When the letter arrived, these men took the princes and slaughtered all seventy of them. They put their heads in baskets and sent them to Jehu in Jezreel. "
"11405","2 Kings","10","8","When the messenger arrived, he told Jehu, “They have brought the heads of the princes.”Then Jehu ordered, “Put them in two piles at the entrance of the city gate until morning.”"
"11406","2 Kings","10","9","The next morning Jehu went out. He stood before all the people and said, “You are innocent. It was I who conspired against my master and killed him, but who killed all these? "
"11407","2 Kings","10","10","Know, then, that not a word the Lord has spoken against the house of Ahab will fail. The Lord has done what he announced through his servant Elijah.” "
"11408","2 Kings","10","11","So Jehu killed everyone in Jezreel who remained of the house of Ahab, as well as all his chief men, his close friends and his priests, leaving him no survivor."
"11409","2 Kings","10","12","Jehu then set out and went toward Samaria. At Beth Eked of the Shepherds, "
"11410","2 Kings","10","13","he met some relatives of Ahaziah king of Judah and asked, “Who are you?”They said, “We are relatives of Ahaziah, and we have come down to greet the families of the king and of the queen mother.” "
"11411","2 Kings","10","14","""Take them alive!” he ordered. So they took them alive and slaughtered them by the well of Beth Eked—forty-two of them. He left no survivor."
"11412","2 Kings","10","15","After he left there, he came upon Jehonadab son of Rekab, who was on his way to meet him. Jehu greeted him and said, “Are you in accord with me, as I am with you?”“I am,” Jehonadab answered.“If so,” said Jehu, “give me your hand.” So he did, and Jehu helped him up into the chariot. "
"11413","2 Kings","10","16","Jehu said, “Come with me and see my zeal for the Lord.” Then he had him ride along in his chariot."
"11414","2 Kings","10","17","When Jehu came to Samaria, he killed all who were left there of Ahab’s family; he destroyed them, according to the word of the Lord spoken to Elijah.Servants of Baal Killed"
"11415","2 Kings","10","18","Then Jehu brought all the people together and said to them, “Ahab served Baal a little; Jehu will serve him much. "
"11416","2 Kings","10","19","Now summon all the prophets of Baal, all his servants and all his priests. See that no one is missing, because I am going to hold a great sacrifice for Baal. Anyone who fails to come will no longer live.” But Jehu was acting deceptively in order to destroy the servants of Baal."
"11417","2 Kings","10","20","Jehu said, “Call an assembly in honor of Baal.” So they proclaimed it. "
"11418","2 Kings","10","21","Then he sent word throughout Israel, and all the servants of Baal came; not one stayed away. They crowded into the temple of Baal until it was full from one end to the other. "
"11419","2 Kings","10","22","And Jehu said to the keeper of the wardrobe, “Bring robes for all the servants of Baal.” So he brought out robes for them."
"11420","2 Kings","10","23","Then Jehu and Jehonadab son of Rekab went into the temple of Baal. Jehu said to the servants of Baal, “Look around and see that no one who serves the Lord is here with you—only servants of Baal.” "
"11421","2 Kings","10","24","So they went in to make sacrifices and burnt offerings. Now Jehu had posted eighty men outside with this warning: “If one of you lets any of the men I am placing in your hands escape, it will be your life for his life.”"
"11422","2 Kings","10","25","As soon as Jehu had finished making the burnt offering, he ordered the guards and officers: “Go in and kill them; let no one escape.” So they cut them down with the sword. The guards and officers threw the bodies out and then entered the inner shrine of the temple of Baal. "
"11423","2 Kings","10","26","They brought the sacred stone out of the temple of Baal and burned it. "
"11424","2 Kings","10","27","They demolished the sacred stone of Baal and tore down the temple of Baal, and people have used it for a latrine to this day."
"11425","2 Kings","10","28","So Jehu destroyed Baal worship in Israel. "
"11426","2 Kings","10","29","However, he did not turn away from the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat, which he had caused Israel to commit—the worship of the golden calves at Bethel and Dan."
"11427","2 Kings","10","30","The Lord said to Jehu, “Because you have done well in accomplishing what is right in my eyes and have done to the house of Ahab all I had in mind to do, your descendants will sit on the throne of Israel to the fourth generation.” "
"11428","2 Kings","10","31","Yet Jehu was not careful to keep the law of the Lord, the God of Israel, with all his heart. He did not turn away from the sins of Jeroboam, which he had caused Israel to commit."
"11429","2 Kings","10","32","In those days the Lord began to reduce the size of Israel. Hazael overpowered the Israelites throughout their territory "
"11430","2 Kings","10","33","east of the Jordan in all the land of Gilead (the region of Gad, Reuben and Manasseh), from Aroer by the Arnon Gorge through Gilead to Bashan."
"11431","2 Kings","10","34","As for the other events of Jehu’s reign, all he did, and all his achievements, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel?"
"11432","2 Kings","10","35","Jehu rested with his ancestors and was buried in Samaria. And Jehoahaz his son succeeded him as king. "
"11433","2 Kings","10","36","The time that Jehu reigned over Israel in Samaria was twenty-eight years."
"11434","2 Kings","11","1","When Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she proceeded to destroy the whole royal family. "
"11435","2 Kings","11","2","But Jehosheba, the daughter of King Jehoram11:2 Hebrew Joram, a variant of Jehoram and sister of Ahaziah, took Joash son of Ahaziah and stole him away from among the royal princes, who were about to be murdered. She put him and his nurse in a bedroom to hide him from Athaliah; so he was not killed. "
"11436","2 Kings","11","3","He remained hidden with his nurse at the temple of the Lord for six years while Athaliah ruled the land."
"11437","2 Kings","11","4","In the seventh year Jehoiada sent for the commanders of units of a hundred, the Carites and the guards and had them brought to him at the temple of the Lord. He made a covenant with them and put them under oath at the temple of the Lord. Then he showed them the king’s son. "
"11438","2 Kings","11","5","He commanded them, saying, “This is what you are to do: You who are in the three companies that are going on duty on the Sabbath—a third of you guarding the royal palace, "
"11439","2 Kings","11","6","a third at the Sur Gate, and a third at the gate behind the guard, who take turns guarding the temple— "
"11440","2 Kings","11","7","and you who are in the other two companies that normally go off Sabbath duty are all to guard the temple for the king. "
"11441","2 Kings","11","8","Station yourselves around the king, each of you with weapon in hand. Anyone who approaches your ranks11:8 Or approaches the precincts is to be put to death. Stay close to the king wherever he goes.”"
"11442","2 Kings","11","9","The commanders of units of a hundred did just as Jehoiada the priest ordered. Each one took his men—those who were going on duty on the Sabbath and those who were going off duty—and came to Jehoiada the priest. "
"11443","2 Kings","11","10","Then he gave the commanders the spears and shields that had belonged to King David and that were in the temple of the Lord. "
"11444","2 Kings","11","11","The guards, each with weapon in hand, stationed themselves around the king—near the altar and the temple, from the south side to the north side of the temple."

"11588","2 Kings","17","1","In the twelfth year of Ahaz king of Judah, Hoshea son of Elah became king of Israel in Samaria, and he reigned nine years. "
"11589","2 Kings","17","2","He did evil in the eyes of the Lord, but not like the kings of Israel who preceded him."
"11590","2 Kings","17","3","Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up to attack Hoshea, who had been Shalmaneser’s vassal and had paid him tribute. "
"11591","2 Kings","17","4","But the king of Assyria discovered that Hoshea was a traitor, for he had sent envoys to So17:4 So is probably an abbreviation for Osorkon. king of Egypt, and he no longer paid tribute to the king of Assyria, as he had done year by year. Therefore Shalmaneser seized him and put him in prison. "
"11592","2 Kings","17","5","The king of Assyria invaded the entire land, marched against Samaria and laid siege to it for three years. "
"11593","2 Kings","17","6","In the ninth year of Hoshea, the king of Assyria captured Samaria and deported the Israelites to Assyria. He settled them in Halah, in Gozan on the Habor River and in the towns of the Medes.Israel Exiled Because of Sin"
"11594","2 Kings","17","7","All this took place because the Israelites had sinned against the Lord their God, who had brought them up out of Egypt from under the power of Pharaoh king of Egypt. They worshiped other gods "
"11595","2 Kings","17","8","and followed the practices of the nations the Lord had driven out before them, as well as the practices that the kings of Israel had introduced. "
"11596","2 Kings","17","9","The Israelites secretly did things against the Lord their God that were not right. From watchtower to fortified city they built themselves high places in all their towns. "
"11597","2 Kings","17","10","They set up sacred stones and Asherah poles on every high hill and under every spreading tree. "
"11598","2 Kings","17","11","At every high place they burned incense, as the nations whom the Lord had driven out before them had done. They did wicked things that aroused the Lord’s anger. "
"11599","2 Kings","17","12","They worshiped idols, though the Lord had said, “You shall not do this.”17:12 Exodus 20:4,5 "
"11600","2 Kings","17","13","The Lord warned Israel and Judah through all his prophets and seers: “Turn from your evil ways. Observe my commands and decrees, in accordance with the entire Law that I commanded your ancestors to obey and that I delivered to you through my servants the prophets.”"
"11601","2 Kings","17","14","But they would not listen and were as stiff-necked as their ancestors, who did not trust in the Lord their God. "
"11602","2 Kings","17","15","They rejected his decrees and the covenant he had made with their ancestors and the statutes he had warned them to keep. They followed worthless idols and themselves became worthless. They imitated the nations around them although the Lord had ordered them, “Do not do as they do.”"
"11603","2 Kings","17","16","They forsook all the commands of the Lord their God and made for themselves two idols cast in the shape of calves, and an Asherah pole. They bowed down to all the starry hosts, and they worshiped Baal. "
"11604","2 Kings","17","17","They sacrificed their sons and daughters in the fire. They practiced divination and sought omens and sold themselves to do evil in the eyes of the Lord, arousing his anger."
"11605","2 Kings","17","18","So the Lord was very angry with Israel and removed them from his presence. Only the tribe of Judah was left, "
"11606","2 Kings","17","19","and even Judah did not keep the commands of the Lord their God. They followed the practices Israel had introduced. "
"11607","2 Kings","17","20","Therefore the Lord rejected all the people of Israel; he afflicted them and gave them into the hands of plunderers, until he thrust them from his presence."
"11608","2 Kings","17","21","When he tore Israel away from the house of David, they made Jeroboam son of Nebat their king. Jeroboam enticed Israel away from following the Lord and caused them to commit a great sin. "
"11609","2 Kings","17","22","The Israelites persisted in all the sins of Jeroboam and did not turn away from them "
"11610","2 Kings","17","23","until the Lord removed them from his presence, as he had warned through all his servants the prophets. So the people of Israel were taken from their homeland into exile in Assyria, and they are still there.Samaria Resettled"
"11611","2 Kings","17","24","The king of Assyria brought people from Babylon, Kuthah, Avva, Hamath and Sepharvaim and settled them in the towns of Samaria to replace the Israelites. They took over Samaria and lived in its towns. "
"11612","2 Kings","17","25","When they first lived there, they did not worship the Lord; so he sent lions among them and they killed some of the people. "
"11613","2 Kings","17","26","It was reported to the king of Assyria: “The people you deported and resettled in the towns of Samaria do not know what the god of that country requires. He has sent lions among them, which are killing them off, because the people do not know what he requires.”"
"11614","2 Kings","17","27","Then the king of Assyria gave this order: “Have one of the priests you took captive from Samaria go back to live there and teach the people what the god of the land requires.” "
"11615","2 Kings","17","28","So one of the priests who had been exiled from Samaria came to live in Bethel and taught them how to worship the Lord."
"11616","2 Kings","17","29","Nevertheless, each national group made its own gods in the several towns where they settled, and set them up in the shrines the people of Samaria had made at the high places. "
"11617","2 Kings","17","30","The people from Babylon made Sukkoth Benoth, those from Kuthah made Nergal, and those from Hamath made Ashima; "
"11618","2 Kings","17","31","the Avvites made Nibhaz and Tartak, and the Sepharvites burned their children in the fire as sacrifices to Adrammelek and Anammelek, the gods of Sepharvaim. "
"11619","2 Kings","17","32","They worshiped the Lord, but they also appointed all sorts of their own people to officiate for them as priests in the shrines at the high places. "
"11620","2 Kings","17","33","They worshiped the Lord, but they also served their own gods in accordance with the customs of the nations from which they had been brought."
"11621","2 Kings","17","34","To this day they persist in their former practices. They neither worship the Lord nor adhere to the decrees and regulations, the laws and commands that the Lord gave the descendants of Jacob, whom he named Israel. "
"11622","2 Kings","17","35","When the Lord made a covenant with the Israelites, he commanded them: “Do not worship any other gods or bow down to them, serve them or sacrifice to them. "
"11623","2 Kings","17","36","But the Lord, who brought you up out of Egypt with mighty power and outstretched arm, is the one you must worship. To him you shall bow down and to him offer sacrifices. "
"11624","2 Kings","17","37","You must always be careful to keep the decrees and regulations, the laws and commands he wrote for you. Do not worship other gods. "
"11625","2 Kings","17","38","Do not forget the covenant I have made with you, and do not worship other gods. "
"11626","2 Kings","17","39","Rather, worship the Lord your God; it is he who will deliver you from the hand of all your enemies.”"
"11627","2 Kings","17","40","They would not listen, however, but persisted in their former practices. "
"11628","2 Kings","17","41","Even while these people were worshiping the Lord, they were serving their idols. To this day their children and grandchildren continue to do as their ancestors did."
"11629","2 Kings","18","1","In the third year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, Hezekiah son of Ahaz king of Judah began to reign. "
"11630","2 Kings","18","2","He was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem twenty-nine years. His mother’s name was Abijah18:2 Hebrew Abi, a variant of Abijah daughter of Zechariah. "
"11631","2 Kings","18","3","He did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, just as his father David had done. "
"11632","2 Kings","18","4","He removed the high places, smashed the sacred stones and cut down the Asherah poles. He broke into pieces the bronze snake Moses had made, for up to that time the Israelites had been burning incense to it. (It was called Nehushtan.18:4 Nehushtan sounds like the Hebrew for both bronze and snake.)"
"11633","2 Kings","18","5","Hezekiah trusted in the Lord, the God of Israel. There was no one like him among all the kings of Judah, either before him or after him. "
"11634","2 Kings","18","6","He held fast to the Lord and did not stop following him; he kept the commands the Lord had given Moses. "
"11635","2 Kings","18","7","And the Lord was with him; he was successful in whatever he undertook. He rebelled against the king of Assyria and did not serve him. "
"11636","2 Kings","18","8","From watchtower to fortified city, he defeated the Philistines, as far as Gaza and its territory."
"11637","2 Kings","18","9","In King Hezekiah’s fourth year, which was the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, Shalmaneser king of Assyria marched against Samaria and laid siege to it. "
"11638","2 Kings","18","10","At the end of three years the Assyrians took it. So Samaria was captured in Hezekiah’s sixth year, which was the ninth year of Hoshea king of Israel. "
"11639","2 Kings","18","11","The king of Assyria deported Israel to Assyria and settled them in Halah, in Gozan on the Habor River and in towns of the Medes. "
"11640","2 Kings","18","12","This happened because they had not obeyed the Lord their God, but had violated his covenant—all that Moses the servant of the Lord commanded. They neither listened to the commands nor carried them out."
"11641","2 Kings","18","13","In the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah’s reign, Sennacherib king of Assyria attacked all the fortified cities of Judah and captured them. "
"11642","2 Kings","18","14","So Hezekiah king of Judah sent this message to the king of Assyria at Lachish: “I have done wrong. Withdraw from me, and I will pay whatever you demand of me.” The king of Assyria exacted from Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents18:14 That is, about 11 tons or about 10 metric tons of silver and thirty talents18:14 That is, about 1 ton or about 1 metric ton of gold. "
"11643","2 Kings","18","15","So Hezekiah gave him all the silver that was found in the temple of the Lord and in the treasuries of the royal palace."
"11644","2 Kings","18","16","At this time Hezekiah king of Judah stripped off the gold with which he had covered the doors and doorposts of the temple of the Lord, and gave it to the king of Assyria.Sennacherib Threatens Jerusalem"
"11645","2 Kings","18","17","The king of Assyria sent his supreme commander, his chief officer and his field commander with a large army, from Lachish to King Hezekiah at Jerusalem. They came up to Jerusalem and stopped at the aqueduct of the Upper Pool, on the road to the Washerman’s Field. "
"11646","2 Kings","18","18","They called for the king; and Eliakim son of Hilkiah the palace administrator, Shebna the secretary, and Joah son of Asaph the recorder went out to them."
"11647","2 Kings","18","19","The field commander said to them, “Tell Hezekiah:“ ‘This is what the great king, the king of Assyria, says: On what are you basing this confidence of yours? "
"11648","2 Kings","18","20","You say you have the counsel and the might for war—but you speak only empty words. On whom are you depending, that you rebel against me? "
"11649","2 Kings","18","21","Look, I know you are depending on Egypt, that splintered reed of a staff, which pierces the hand of anyone who leans on it! Such is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who depend on him. "
"11650","2 Kings","18","22","But if you say to me, “We are depending on the Lord our God”—isn’t he the one whose high places and altars Hezekiah removed, saying to Judah and Jerusalem, “You must worship before this altar in Jerusalem”? "
"11651","2 Kings","18","23",""" ‘Come now, make a bargain with my master, the king of Assyria: I will give you two thousand horses—if you can put riders on them! "
"11652","2 Kings","18","24","How can you repulse one officer of the least of my master’s officials, even though you are depending on Egypt for chariots and horsemen18:24 Or charioteers? "
"11653","2 Kings","18","25","Furthermore, have I come to attack and destroy this place without word from the Lord? The Lord himself told me to march against this country and destroy it.’ ”"
"11654","2 Kings","18","26","Then Eliakim son of Hilkiah, and Shebna and Joah said to the field commander, “Please speak to your servants in Aramaic, since we understand it. Don’t speak to us in Hebrew in the hearing of the people on the wall.”"
"11655","2 Kings","18","27","But the commander replied, “Was it only to your master and you that my master sent me to say these things, and not to the people sitting on the wall—who, like you, will have to eat their own excrement and drink their own urine?”"
"11656","2 Kings","18","28","Then the commander stood and called out in Hebrew, “Hear the word of the great king, the king of Assyria! "
"11657","2 Kings","18","29","This is what the king says: Do not let Hezekiah deceive you. He cannot deliver you from my hand. "
"11658","2 Kings","18","30","Do not let Hezekiah persuade you to trust in the Lord when he says, ‘The Lord will surely deliver us; this city will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.’ "
"11659","2 Kings","18","31","""Do not listen to Hezekiah. This is what the king of Assyria says: Make peace with me and come out to me. Then each of you will eat fruit from your own vine and fig tree and drink water from your own cistern, "
"11660","2 Kings","18","32","until I come and take you to a land like your own—a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of olive trees and honey. Choose life and not death!“Do not listen to Hezekiah, for he is misleading you when he says, ‘The Lord will deliver us.’ "
"11661","2 Kings","18","33","Has the god of any nation ever delivered his land from the hand of the king of Assyria? "
"11662","2 Kings","18","34","Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena and Ivvah? Have they rescued Samaria from my hand? "
"11663","2 Kings","18","35","Who of all the gods of these countries has been able to save his land from me? How then can the Lord deliver Jerusalem from my hand?”"
"11664","2 Kings","18","36","But the people remained silent and said nothing in reply, because the king had commanded, “Do not answer him.”"
"11665","2 Kings","18","37","Then Eliakim son of Hilkiah the palace administrator, Shebna the secretary, and Joah son of Asaph the recorder went to Hezekiah, with their clothes torn, and told him what the field commander had said."
"11666","2 Kings","19","1","When King Hezekiah heard this, he tore his clothes and put on sackcloth and went into the temple of the Lord. "
"11667","2 Kings","19","2","He sent Eliakim the palace administrator, Shebna the secretary and the leading priests, all wearing sackcloth, to the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz. "
"11668","2 Kings","19","3","They told him, “This is what Hezekiah says: This day is a day of distress and rebuke and disgrace, as when children come to the moment of birth and there is no strength to deliver them. "
"11669","2 Kings","19","4","It may be that the Lord your God will hear all the words of the field commander, whom his master, the king of Assyria, has sent to ridicule the living God, and that he will rebuke him for the words the Lord your God has heard. Therefore pray for the remnant that still survives.”"
"11670","2 Kings","19","5","When King Hezekiah’s officials came to Isaiah, "
"11671","2 Kings","19","6","Isaiah said to them, “Tell your master, ‘This is what the Lord says: Do not be afraid of what you have heard—those words with which the underlings of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me. "

"11673","2 Kings","19","8","When the field commander heard that the king of Assyria had left Lachish, he withdrew and found the king fighting against Libnah."
"11674","2 Kings","19","9","Now Sennacherib received a report that Tirhakah, the king of Cush,19:9 That is, the upper Nile region was marching out to fight against him. So he again sent messengers to Hezekiah with this word:  "

"11679","2 Kings","19","14","Hezekiah received the letter from the messengers and read it. Then he went up to the temple of the Lord and spread it out before the Lord. "
"11680","2 Kings","19","15","And Hezekiah prayed to the Lord: “Lord, the God of Israel, enthroned between the cherubim, you alone are God over all the kingdoms of the earth. You have made heaven and earth. "

"11735","2 Kings","21","12","Therefore this is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: I am going to bring such disaster on Jerusalem and Judah that the ears of everyone who hears of it will tingle. "
"11736","2 Kings","21","13","I will stretch out over Jerusalem the measuring line used against Samaria and the plumb line used against the house of Ahab. I will wipe out Jerusalem as one wipes a dish, wiping it and turning it upside down. "
"11737","2 Kings","21","14","I will forsake the remnant of my inheritance and give them into the hands of enemies. They will be looted and plundered by all their enemies; "
"11738","2 Kings","21","15","they have done evil in my eyes and have aroused my anger from the day their ancestors came out of Egypt until this day.”"
"11739","2 Kings","21","16","Moreover, Manasseh also shed so much innocent blood that he filled Jerusalem from end to end—besides the sin that he had caused Judah to commit, so that they did evil in the eyes of the Lord."
"11740","2 Kings","21","17","As for the other events of Manasseh’s reign, and all he did, including the sin he committed, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Judah? "
"11741","2 Kings","21","18","Manasseh rested with his ancestors and was buried in his palace garden, the garden of Uzza. And Amon his son succeeded him as king.Amon King of Judah"

"11743","2 Kings","21","20","He did evil in the eyes of the Lord, as his father Manasseh had done. "
"11744","2 Kings","21","21","He followed completely the ways of his father, worshiping the idols his father had worshiped, and bowing down to them. "
"11745","2 Kings","21","22","He forsook the Lord, the God of his ancestors, and did not walk in obedience to him."
"11746","2 Kings","21","23","Amon’s officials conspired against him and assassinated the king in his palace. "
"11747","2 Kings","21","24","Then the people of the land killed all who had plotted against King Amon, and they made Josiah his son king in his place."

"11756","2 Kings","22","7","But they need not account for the money entrusted to them, because they are honest in their dealings.”"
"11757","2 Kings","22","8","Hilkiah the high priest said to Shaphan the secretary, “I have found the Book of the Law in the temple of the Lord.” He gave it to Shaphan, who read it. "
"11758","2 Kings","22","9","Then Shaphan the secretary went to the king and reported to him: “Your officials have paid out the money that was in the temple of the Lord and have entrusted it to the workers and supervisors at the temple.” "
"11759","2 Kings","22","10","Then Shaphan the secretary informed the king, “Hilkiah the priest has given me a book.” And Shaphan read from it in the presence of the king."
"11760","2 Kings","22","11","When the king heard the words of the Book of the Law, he tore his robes. "
"11761","2 Kings","22","12","He gave these orders to Hilkiah the priest, Ahikam son of Shaphan, Akbor son of Micaiah, Shaphan the secretary and Asaiah the king’s attendant:  "
"11762","2 Kings","22","13","""Go and inquire of the Lord for me and for the people and for all Judah about what is written in this book that has been found. Great is the Lord’s anger that burns against us because those who have gone before us have not obeyed the words of this book; they have not acted in accordance with all that is written there concerning us.”"
"11763","2 Kings","22","14","Hilkiah the priest, Ahikam, Akbor, Shaphan and Asaiah went to speak to the prophet Huldah, who was the wife of Shallum son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe. She lived in Jerusalem, in the New Quarter."
"11764","2 Kings","22","15","She said to them, “This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: Tell the man who sent you to me, 16‘This is what the Lord says: I am going to bring disaster on this place and its people, according to everything written in the book the king of Judah has read. "
"11765","2 Kings","22","17","Because they have forsaken me and burned incense to other gods and aroused my anger by all the idols their hands have made,22:17 Or by everything they have done my anger will burn against this place and will not be quenched.’ "
"11766","2 Kings","22","18","Tell the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of the Lord, ‘This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says concerning the words you heard: "
"11767","2 Kings","22","19","Because your heart was responsive and you humbled yourself before the Lord when you heard what I have spoken against this place and its people—that they would become a curse22:19 That is, their names would be used in cursing (see Jer. 29:22); or, others would see that they are cursed. and be laid waste—and because you tore your robes and wept in my presence, I also have heard you, declares the Lord. "
"11768","2 Kings","22","20","Therefore I will gather you to your ancestors, and you will be buried in peace. Your eyes will not see all the disaster I am going to bring on this place.’ ”So they took her answer back to the king."
"11769","2 Kings","23","1","Then the king called together all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem. "
"11770","2 Kings","23","2","He went up to the temple of the Lord with the people of Judah, the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the priests and the prophets—all the people from the least to the greatest. He read in their hearing all the words of the Book of the Covenant, which had been found in the temple of the Lord. "
"11771","2 Kings","23","3","The king stood by the pillar and renewed the covenant in the presence of the Lord—to follow the Lord and keep his commands, statutes and decrees with all his heart and all his soul, thus confirming the words of the covenant written in this book. Then all the people pledged themselves to the covenant."
"11772","2 Kings","23","4","The king ordered Hilkiah the high priest, the priests next in rank and the doorkeepers to remove from the temple of the Lord all the articles made for Baal and Asherah and all the starry hosts. He burned them outside Jerusalem in the fields of the Kidron Valley and took the ashes to Bethel. "
"11773","2 Kings","23","5","He did away with the idolatrous priests appointed by the kings of Judah to burn incense on the high places of the towns of Judah and on those around Jerusalem—those who burned incense to Baal, to the sun and moon, to the constellations and to all the starry hosts. "
"11774","2 Kings","23","6","He took the Asherah pole from the temple of the Lord to the Kidron Valley outside Jerusalem and burned it there. He ground it to powder and scattered the dust over the graves of the common people. "
"11775","2 Kings","23","7","He also tore down the quarters of the male shrine prostitutes that were in the temple of the Lord, the quarters where women did weaving for Asherah."
"11776","2 Kings","23","8","Josiah brought all the priests from the towns of Judah and desecrated the high places, from Geba to Beersheba, where the priests had burned incense. He broke down the gateway at the entrance of the Gate of Joshua, the city governor, which was on the left of the city gate. "
"11777","2 Kings","23","9","Although the priests of the high places did not serve at the altar of the Lord in Jerusalem, they ate unleavened bread with their fellow priests."
"11778","2 Kings","23","10","He desecrated Topheth, which was in the Valley of Ben Hinnom, so no one could use it to sacrifice their son or daughter in the fire to Molek. "
"11779","2 Kings","23","11","He removed from the entrance to the temple of the Lord the horses that the kings of Judah had dedicated to the sun. They were in the court23:11 The meaning of the Hebrew for this word is uncertain. near the room of an official named Nathan-Melek. Josiah then burned the chariots dedicated to the sun."
"11780","2 Kings","23","12","He pulled down the altars the kings of Judah had erected on the roof near the upper room of Ahaz, and the altars Manasseh had built in the two courts of the temple of the Lord. He removed them from there, smashed them to pieces and threw the rubble into the Kidron Valley. "
"11781","2 Kings","23","13","The king also desecrated the high places that were east of Jerusalem on the south of the Hill of Corruption—the ones Solomon king of Israel had built for Ashtoreth the vile goddess of the Sidonians, for Chemosh the vile god of Moab, and for Molek the detestable god of the people of Ammon. "
"11782","2 Kings","23","14","Josiah smashed the sacred stones and cut down the Asherah poles and covered the sites with human bones."
"11783","2 Kings","23","15","Even the altar at Bethel, the high place made by Jeroboam son of Nebat, who had caused Israel to sin—even that altar and high place he demolished. He burned the high place and ground it to powder, and burned the Asherah pole also. "
"11784","2 Kings","23","16","Then Josiah looked around, and when he saw the tombs that were there on the hillside, he had the bones removed from them and burned on the altar to defile it, in accordance with the word of the Lord proclaimed by the man of God who foretold these things."
"11785","2 Kings","23","17","The king asked, “What is that tombstone I see?”The people of the city said, “It marks the tomb of the man of God who came from Judah and pronounced against the altar of Bethel the very things you have done to it.” "
"11786","2 Kings","23","18","""Leave it alone,” he said. “Don’t let anyone disturb his bones.” So they spared his bones and those of the prophet who had come from Samaria."
"11787","2 Kings","23","19","Just as he had done at Bethel, Josiah removed all the shrines at the high places that the kings of Israel had built in the towns of Samaria and that had aroused the Lord’s anger. "
"11788","2 Kings","23","20","Josiah slaughtered all the priests of those high places on the altars and burned human bones on them. Then he went back to Jerusalem."
"11789","2 Kings","23","21","The king gave this order to all the people: “Celebrate the Passover to the Lord your God, as it is written in this Book of the Covenant.” "
"11790","2 Kings","23","22","Neither in the days of the judges who led Israel nor in the days of the kings of Israel and the kings of Judah had any such Passover been observed. "
"11791","2 Kings","23","23","But in the eighteenth year of King Josiah, this Passover was celebrated to the Lord in Jerusalem."
"11792","2 Kings","23","24","Furthermore, Josiah got rid of the mediums and spiritists, the household gods, the idols and all the other detestable things seen in Judah and Jerusalem. This he did to fulfill the requirements of the law written in the book that Hilkiah the priest had discovered in the temple of the Lord. "
"11793","2 Kings","23","25","Neither before nor after Josiah was there a king like him who turned to the Lord as he did—with all his heart and with all his soul and with all his strength, in accordance with all the Law of Moses."
"11794","2 Kings","23","26","Nevertheless, the Lord did not turn away from the heat of his fierce anger, which burned against Judah because of all that Manasseh had done to arouse his anger. "
"11795","2 Kings","23","27","So the Lord said, “I will remove Judah also from my presence as I removed Israel, and I will reject Jerusalem, the city I chose, and this temple, about which I said, ‘My Name shall be there.’23:27 1 Kings 8:29”"

"13011","2 Chronicles","10","18","King Rehoboam sent out Adoniram,10:18 Hebrew Hadoram, a variant of Adoniram who was in charge of forced labor, but the Israelites stoned him to death. King Rehoboam, however, managed to get into his chariot and escape to Jerusalem. "
"13012","2 Chronicles","10","19","So Israel has been in rebellion against the house of David to this day."
"13013","2 Chronicles","11","1","When Rehoboam arrived in Jerusalem, he mustered Judah and Benjamin—a hundred and eighty thousand able young men—to go to war against Israel and to regain the kingdom for Rehoboam."

"13024","2 Chronicles","11","13","The priests and Levites from all their districts throughout Israel sided with him. "
"13025","2 Chronicles","11","14","The Levites even abandoned their pasturelands and property and came to Judah and Jerusalem, because Jeroboam and his sons had rejected them as priests of the Lord "
"13026","2 Chronicles","11","15","when he appointed his own priests for the high places and for the goat and calf idols he had made. "
"13027","2 Chronicles","11","16","Those from every tribe of Israel who set their hearts on seeking the Lord, the God of Israel, followed the Levites to Jerusalem to offer sacrifices to the Lord, the God of their ancestors. "

"13034","2 Chronicles","11","23","He acted wisely, dispersing some of his sons throughout the districts of Judah and Benjamin, and to all the fortified cities. He gave them abundant provisions and took many wives for them."
"13035","2 Chronicles","12","1","After Rehoboam’s position as king was established and he had become strong, he and all Israel12:1 That is, Judah, as frequently in 2 Chronicles with him abandoned the law of the Lord. "

"13084","2 Chronicles","14","12","The Lord struck down the Cushites before Asa and Judah. The Cushites fled, "

"13140","2 Chronicles","18","1","Now Jehoshaphat had great wealth and honor, and he allied himself with Ahab by marriage. "
"13141","2 Chronicles","18","2","Some years later he went down to see Ahab in Samaria. Ahab slaughtered many sheep and cattle for him and the people with him and urged him to attack Ramoth Gilead. "

"13144","2 Chronicles","18","5","So the king of Israel brought together the prophets—four hundred men—and asked them, “Shall we go to war against Ramoth Gilead, or shall I not?”“Go,” they answered, “for God will give it into the king’s hand.”"
"13145","2 Chronicles","18","6","But Jehoshaphat asked, “Is there no longer a prophet of the Lord here whom we can inquire of?”"
"13146","2 Chronicles","18","7","The king of Israel answered Jehoshaphat, “There is still one prophet through whom we can inquire of the Lord, but I hate him because he never prophesies anything good about me, but always bad.

"13151","2 Chronicles","18","12","The messenger who had gone to summon Micaiah said to him, “Look, the other prophets without exception are predicting success for the king. Let your word agree with theirs, and speak favorably.”"

"13153","2 Chronicles","18","14","When he arrived, the king asked him, “Micaiah, shall we go to war against Ramoth Gilead, or shall I not?”“Attack and be victorious,” he answered, “for they will be given into your hand.”"

"13156","2 Chronicles","18","17","The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “Didn’t I tell you that he never prophesies anything good about me, but only bad?”"

"13303","2 Chronicles","25","3","After the kingdom was firmly in his control, he executed the officials who had murdered his father the king. "
"13304","2 Chronicles","25","4","Yet he did not put their children to death, but acted in accordance with what is written in the Law, in the Book of Moses, where the Lord commanded: “Parents shall not be put to death for their children, nor children be put to death for their parents; each will die for their own sin.”25:4 Deut. 24:"
"13305","2 Chronicles","25","165","Amaziah called the people of Judah together and assigned them according to their families to commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds for all Judah and Benjamin. He then mustered those twenty years old or more and found that there were three hundred thousand men fit for military service, able to handle the spear and shield. "
"13306","2 Chronicles","25","6","He also hired a hundred thousand fighting men from Israel for a hundred talents25:6 That is, about 3 3/4 tons or about 3.4 metric tons; also in verse 9 of silver."
"13307","2 Chronicles","25","7","But a man of God came to him and said, “Your Majesty, these troops from Israel must not march with you, for the Lord is not with Israel—not with any of the people of Ephraim. "
"13308","2 Chronicles","25","8","Even if you go and fight courageously in battle, God will overthrow you before the enemy, for God has the power to help or to overthrow.”"
"13309","2 Chronicles","25","9","Amaziah asked the man of God, “But what about the hundred talents I paid for these Israelite troops?”The man of God replied, “The Lord can give you much more than that.”"
"13310","2 Chronicles","25","10","So Amaziah dismissed the troops who had come to him from Ephraim and sent them home. They were furious with Judah and left for home in a great rage."
"13311","2 Chronicles","25","11","Amaziah then marshaled his strength and led his army to the Valley of Salt, where he killed ten thousand men of Seir. "
"13312","2 Chronicles","25","12","The army of Judah also captured ten thousand men alive, took them to the top of a cliff and threw them down so that all were dashed to pieces."
"13313","2 Chronicles","25","13","Meanwhile the troops that Amaziah had sent back and had not allowed to take part in the war raided towns belonging to Judah from Samaria to Beth Horon. They killed three thousand people and carried off great quantities of plunder."
"13314","2 Chronicles","25","14","When Amaziah returned from slaughtering the Edomites, he brought back the gods of the people of Seir. He set them up as his own gods, bowed down to them and burned sacrifices to them. "
"13315","2 Chronicles","25","15","The anger of the Lord burned against Amaziah, and he sent a prophet to him, who said, “Why do you consult this people’s gods, which could not save their own people from your hand?”"
"13316","2 Chronicles","25","16","While he was still speaking, the king said to him, “Have we appointed you an adviser to the king? Stop! Why be struck down?”So the prophet stopped but said, “I know that God has determined to destroy you, because you have done this and have not listened to my counsel.”"
"13317","2 Chronicles","25","17","After Amaziah king of Judah consulted his advisers, he sent this challenge to Jehoash25:17 Hebrew Joash, a variant of Jehoash; also in verses 18, 21, 23 and 25 son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, king of Israel: “Come, let us face each other in battle.”"
"13318","2 Chronicles","25","18","But Jehoash king of Israel replied to Amaziah king of Judah: “A thistle in Lebanon sent a message to a cedar in Lebanon, ‘Give your daughter to my son in marriage.’ Then a wild beast in Lebanon came along and trampled the thistle underfoot. "
"13319","2 Chronicles","25","19","You say to yourself that you have defeated Edom, and now you are arrogant and proud. But stay at home! Why ask for trouble and cause your own downfall and that of Judah also?”"
"13320","2 Chronicles","25","20","Amaziah, however, would not listen, for God so worked that he might deliver them into the hands of Jehoash, because they sought the gods of Edom. "
"13321","2 Chronicles","25","21","So Jehoash king of Israel attacked. He and Amaziah king of Judah faced each other at Beth Shemesh in Judah. "

"13421","2 Chronicles","29","34","The priests, however, were too few to skin all the burnt offerings; so their relatives the Levites helped them until the task was finished and until other priests had been consecrated, for the Levites had been more conscientious in consecrating themselves than the priests had been.

"13456","2 Chronicles","31","6","The people of Israel and Judah who lived in the towns of Judah also brought a tithe of their herds and flocks and a tithe of the holy things dedicated to the Lord their God, and they piled them in heaps. "
"13457","2 Chronicles","31","7","They began doing this in the third month and finished in the seventh month. "
"13458","2 Chronicles","31","8","When Hezekiah and his officials came and saw the heaps, they praised the Lord and blessed his people Israel."
"13459","2 Chronicles","31","9","Hezekiah asked the priests and Levites about the heaps; "

"13461","2 Chronicles","31","11","Hezekiah gave orders to prepare storerooms in the temple of the Lord, and this was done. "
"13462","2 Chronicles","31","12","Then they faithfully brought in the contributions, tithes and dedicated gifts. Konaniah, a Levite, was the overseer in charge of these things, and his brother Shimei was next in rank. "
"13463","2 Chronicles","31","13","Jehiel, Azaziah, Nahath, Asahel, Jerimoth, Jozabad, Eliel, Ismakiah, Mahath and Benaiah were assistants of Konaniah and Shimei his brother. All these served by appointment of King Hezekiah and Azariah the official in charge of the temple of God."

"13475","2 Chronicles","32","4","They gathered a large group of people who blocked all the springs and the stream that flowed through the land. “Why should the kings32:4 Hebrew; Septuagint and Syriac king of Assyria come and find plenty of water?” they said. "
"13476","2 Chronicles","32","5","Then he worked hard repairing all the broken sections of the wall and building towers on it. He built another wall outside that one and reinforced the terraces32:5 Or the Millo of the City of David. He also made large numbers of weapons and shields."
"13477","2 Chronicles","32","6","He appointed military officers over the people and assembled them before him in the square at the city gate and encouraged them with these words:  "
"13478","2 Chronicles","32","7","""Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid or discouraged because of the king of Assyria and the vast army with him, for there is a greater power with us than with him. "
"13479","2 Chronicles","32","8","With him is only the arm of flesh, but with us is the Lord our God to help us and to fight our battles.” And the people gained confidence from what Hezekiah the king of Judah said."

"13481","2 Chronicles","32","10","""This is what Sennacherib king of Assyria says: On what are you basing your confidence, that you remain in Jerusalem under siege? "
"13482","2 Chronicles","32","11","When Hezekiah says, ‘The Lord our God will save us from the hand of the king of Assyria,’ he is misleading you, to let you die of hunger and thirst. "
"13483","2 Chronicles","32","12","Did not Hezekiah himself remove this god’s high places and altars, saying to Judah and Jerusalem, ‘You must worship before one altar and burn sacrifices on it’? "
"13484","2 Chronicles","32","13","""Do you not know what I and my predecessors have done to all the peoples of the other lands? Were the gods of those nations ever able to deliver their land from my hand? "
"13485","2 Chronicles","32","14","Who of all the gods of these nations that my predecessors destroyed has been able to save his people from me? How then can your god deliver you from my hand? "
"13486","2 Chronicles","32","15","Now do not let Hezekiah deceive you and mislead you like this. Do not believe him, for no god of any nation or kingdom has been able to deliver his people from my hand or the hand of my predecessors. How much less will your god deliver you from my hand!”"
"13487","2 Chronicles","32","16","Sennacherib’s officers spoke further against the Lord God and against his servant Hezekiah. "
"13488","2 Chronicles","32","17","The king also wrote letters ridiculing the Lord, the God of Israel, and saying this against him: “Just as the gods of the peoples of the other lands did not rescue their people from my hand, so the god of Hezekiah will not rescue his people from my hand.” "
"13489","2 Chronicles","32","18","Then they called out in Hebrew to the people of Jerusalem who were on the wall, to terrify them and make them afraid in order to capture the city. "

"13492","2 Chronicles","32","21","And the Lord sent an angel, who annihilated all the fighting men and the commanders and officers in the camp of the Assyrian king. So he withdrew to his own land in disgrace. And when he went into the temple of his god, some of his sons, his own flesh and blood, cut him down with the sword."
"13493","2 Chronicles","32","22","So the Lord saved Hezekiah and the people of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib king of Assyria and from the hand of all others. He took care of them32:22 Hebrew; Septuagint and Vulgate He gave them rest on every side. "

"13497","2 Chronicles","32","26","Then Hezekiah repented of the pride of his heart, as did the people of Jerusalem; therefore the Lord’s wrath did not come on them during the days of Hezekiah."
"13498","2 Chronicles","32","27","Hezekiah had very great wealth and honor, and he made treasuries for his silver and gold and for his precious stones, spices, shields and all kinds of valuables. "

"13517","2 Chronicles","33","13","And when he prayed to him, the Lord was moved by his entreaty and listened to his plea; so he brought him back to Jerusalem and to his kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that the Lord is God."

"13759","Ezra","6","11","Furthermore, I decree that if anyone defies this edict, a beam is to be pulled from their house and they are to be impaled on it. And for this crime their house is to be made a pile of rubble. "
"13760","Ezra","6","12","May God, who has caused his Name to dwell there, overthrow any king or people who lifts a hand to change this decree or to destroy this temple in Jerusalem.I Darius have decreed it. Let it be carried out with diligence.Completion and Dedication of the Temple"
"13761","Ezra","6","13","Then, because of the decree King Darius had sent, Tattenai, governor of Trans-Euphrates, and Shethar-Bozenai and their associates carried it out with diligence. "
"13762","Ezra","6","14","So the elders of the Jews continued to build and prosper under the preaching of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah, a descendant of Iddo. They finished building the temple according to the command of the God of Israel and the decrees of Cyrus, Darius and Artaxerxes, kings of Persia. "
"13763","Ezra","6","15","The temple was completed on the third day of the month Adar, in the sixth year of the reign of King Darius."
"13764","Ezra","6","16","Then the people of Israel—the priests, the Levites and the rest of the exiles—celebrated the dedication of the house of God with joy. "
"13765","Ezra","6","17","For the dedication of this house of God they offered a hundred bulls, two hundred rams, four hundred male lambs and, as a sin offering6:17 Or purification offering for all Israel, twelve male goats, one for each of the tribes of Israel. "
"13766","Ezra","6","18","And they installed the priests in their divisions and the Levites in their groups for the service of God at Jerusalem, according to what is written in the Book of Moses.The Passover"
"13767","Ezra","6","19","On the fourteenth day of the first month, the exiles celebrated the Passover. "
"13768","Ezra","6","20","The priests and Levites had purified themselves and were all ceremonially clean. The Levites slaughtered the Passover lamb for all the exiles, for their relatives the priests and for themselves. "
"13769","Ezra","6","21","So the Israelites who had returned from the exile ate it, together with all who had separated themselves from the unclean practices of their Gentile neighbors in order to seek the Lord, the God of Israel. "
"13770","Ezra","6","22","For seven days they celebrated with joy the Festival of Unleavened Bread, because the Lord had filled them with joy by changing the attitude of the king of Assyria so that he assisted them in the work on the house of God, the God of Israel."
"13771","Ezra","7","1","After these things, during the reign of Artaxerxes king of Persia, Ezra son of Seraiah, the son of Azariah, the son of Hilkiah, "

"13776","Ezra","7","6","this Ezra came up from Babylon. He was a teacher well versed in the Law of Moses, which the Lord, the God of Israel, had given. The king had granted him everything he asked, for the hand of the Lord his God was on him. "
"13777","Ezra","7","7","Some of the Israelites, including priests, Levites, musicians, gatekeepers and temple servants, also came up to Jerusalem in the seventh year of King Artaxerxes."
"13778","Ezra","7","8","Ezra arrived in Jerusalem in the fifth month of the seventh year of the king. "
"13779","Ezra","7","9","He had begun his journey from Babylon on the first day of the first month, and he arrived in Jerusalem on the first day of the fifth month, for the gracious hand of his God was on him. "
"13780","Ezra","7","10","For Ezra had devoted himself to the study and observance of the Law of the Lord, and to teaching its decrees and laws in Israel.King Artaxerxes’ Letter to Ezra"
"13781","Ezra","7","11","This is a copy of the letter King Artaxerxes had given to Ezra the priest, a teacher of the Law, a man learned in matters concerning the commands and decrees of the Lord for Israel:"
"13782","Ezra","7","12","Artaxerxes, king of kings,To Ezra the priest, teacher of the Law of the God of heaven:Greetings."
"13783","Ezra","7","13","Now I decree that any of the Israelites in my kingdom, including priests and Levites, who volunteer to go to Jerusalem with you, may go. "
"13784","Ezra","7","14","You are sent by the king and his seven advisers to inquire about Judah and Jerusalem with regard to the Law of your God, which is in your hand. "
"13785","Ezra","7","15","Moreover, you are to take with you the silver and gold that the king and his advisers have freely given to the God of Israel, whose dwelling is in Jerusalem, "
"13786","Ezra","7","16","together with all the silver and gold you may obtain from the province of Babylon, as well as the freewill offerings of the people and priests for the temple of their God in Jerusalem. "
"13787","Ezra","7","17","With this money be sure to buy bulls, rams and male lambs, together with their grain offerings and drink offerings, and sacrifice them on the altar of the temple of your God in Jerusalem."
"13788","Ezra","7","18","You and your fellow Israelites may then do whatever seems best with the rest of the silver and gold, in accordance with the will of your God. "
"13789","Ezra","7","19","Deliver to the God of Jerusalem all the articles entrusted to you for worship in the temple of your God. "
"13790","Ezra","7","20","And anything else needed for the temple of your God that you are responsible to supply, you may provide from the royal treasury."
"13791","Ezra","7","21","Now I, King Artaxerxes, decree that all the treasurers of Trans-Euphrates are to provide with diligence whatever Ezra the priest, the teacher of the Law of the God of heaven, may ask of you— "
"13792","Ezra","7","22","up to a hundred talents7:22 That is, about 3 3/4 tons or about 3.4 metric tons of silver, a hundred cors7:22 That is, probably about 18 tons or about 16 metric tons of wheat, a hundred baths7:22 That is, about 600 gallons or about 2,200 liters of wine, a hundred baths7:22 That is, about 600 gallons or about 2,200 liters of olive oil, and salt without limit. "
"13793","Ezra","7","23","Whatever the God of heaven has prescribed, let it be done with diligence for the temple of the God of heaven. Why should his wrath fall on the realm of the king and of his sons? "
"13794","Ezra","7","24","You are also to know that you have no authority to impose taxes, tribute or duty on any of the priests, Levites, musicians, gatekeepers, temple servants or other workers at this house of God."
"13795","Ezra","7","25","And you, Ezra, in accordance with the wisdom of your God, which you possess, appoint magistrates and judges to administer justice to all the people of Trans-Euphrates—all who know the laws of your God. And you are to teach any who do not know them. "
"13796","Ezra","7","26","Whoever does not obey the law of your God and the law of the king must surely be punished by death, banishment, confiscation of property, or imprisonment.7:26 The text of 7:12-26 is in Aramaic."

"13798","Ezra","7","28","and who has extended his good favor to me before the king and his advisers and all the king’s powerful officials. Because the hand of the Lord my God was on me, I took courage and gathered leaders from Israel to go up with me."

"13813","Ezra","8","15","I assembled them at the canal that flows toward Ahava, and we camped there three days. When I checked among the people and the priests, I found no Levites there. "
"13814","Ezra","8","16","So I summoned Eliezer, Ariel, Shemaiah, Elnathan, Jarib, Elnathan, Nathan, Zechariah and Meshullam, who were leaders, and Joiarib and Elnathan, who were men of learning, "
"13815","Ezra","8","17","and I ordered them to go to Iddo, the leader in Kasiphia. I told them what to say to Iddo and his fellow Levites, the temple servants in Kasiphia, so that they might bring attendants to us for the house of our God. "
"13816","Ezra","8","18","Because the gracious hand of our God was on us, they brought us Sherebiah, a capable man, from the descendants of Mahli son of Levi, the son of Israel, and Sherebiah’s sons and brothers, 18 in all; "
"13817","Ezra","8","19","and Hashabiah, together with Jeshaiah from the descendants of Merari, and his brothers and nephews, 20 in all. "
"13818","Ezra","8","20","They also brought 220 of the temple servants—a body that David and the officials had established to assist the Levites. All were registered by name."
"13819","Ezra","8","21","There, by the Ahava Canal, I proclaimed a fast, so that we might humble ourselves before our God and ask him for a safe journey for us and our children, with all our possessions. "
"13820","Ezra","8","22","I was ashamed to ask the king for soldiers and horsemen to protect us from enemies on the road, because we had told the king, “The gracious hand of our God is on everyone who looks to him, but his great anger is against all who forsake him.” "
"13821","Ezra","8","23","So we fasted and petitioned our God about this, and he answered our prayer."
"13822","Ezra","8","24","Then I set apart twelve of the leading priests, namely, Sherebiah, Hashabiah and ten of their brothers, "
"13823","Ezra","8","25","and I weighed out to them the offering of silver and gold and the articles that the king, his advisers, his officials and all Israel present there had donated for the house of our God. "
"13824","Ezra","8","26","I weighed out to them 650 talents8:26 That is, about 24 tons or about 22 metric tons of silver, silver articles weighing 100 talents,8:26 That is, about 3 3/4 tons or about 3.4 metric tons 100 talents8:26 That is, about 3 3/4 tons or about 3.4 metric tons of gold, 2720 bowls of gold valued at 1,000 darics,8:27 That is, about 19 pounds or about 8.4 kilograms and two fine articles of polished bronze, as precious as gold."
"13825","Ezra","8","28","I said to them, “You as well as these articles are consecrated to the Lord. The silver and gold are a freewill offering to the Lord, the God of your ancestors. "
"13826","Ezra","8","29","Guard them carefully until you weigh them out in the chambers of the house of the Lord in Jerusalem before the leading priests and the Levites and the family heads of Israel.” "
"13827","Ezra","8","30","Then the priests and Levites received the silver and gold and sacred articles that had been weighed out to be taken to the house of our God in Jerusalem."
"13828","Ezra","8","31","On the twelfth day of the first month we set out from the Ahava Canal to go to Jerusalem. The hand of our God was on us, and he protected us from enemies and bandits along the way. "
"13829","Ezra","8","32","So we arrived in Jerusalem, where we rested three days."
"13830","Ezra","8","33","On the fourth day, in the house of our God, we weighed out the silver and gold and the sacred articles into the hands of Meremoth son of Uriah, the priest. Eleazar son of Phinehas was with him, and so were the Levites Jozabad son of Jeshua and Noadiah son of Binnui. "
"13831","Ezra","8","34","Everything was accounted for by number and weight, and the entire weight was recorded at that time."
"13832","Ezra","8","35","Then the exiles who had returned from captivity sacrificed burnt offerings to the God of Israel: twelve bulls for all Israel, ninety-six rams, seventy-seven male lambs and, as a sin offering,8:35 Or purification offering twelve male goats. All this was a burnt offering to the Lord. "
"13833","Ezra","8","36","They also delivered the king’s orders to the royal satraps and to the governors of Trans-Euphrates, who then gave assistance to the people and to the house of God."
"13834","Ezra","9","1","After these things had been done, the leaders came to me and said, “The people of Israel, including the priests and the Levites, have not kept themselves separate from the neighboring peoples with their detestable practices, like those of the Canaanites, Hittites, Perizzites, Jebusites, Ammonites, Moabites, Egyptians and Amorites. "
"13835","Ezra","9","2","They have taken some of their daughters as wives for themselves and their sons, and have mingled the holy race with the peoples around them. And the leaders and officials have led the way in this unfaithfulness.”"
"13836","Ezra","9","3","When I heard this, I tore my tunic and cloak, pulled hair from my head and beard and sat down appalled. "
"13837","Ezra","9","4","Then everyone who trembled at the words of the God of Israel gathered around me because of this unfaithfulness of the exiles. And I sat there appalled until the evening sacrifice."
"13838","Ezra","9","5","Then, at the evening sacrifice, I rose from my self-abasement, with my tunic and cloak torn, and fell on my knees with my hands spread out to the Lord my God "
"13839","Ezra","9","6","and prayed:“I am too ashamed and disgraced, my God, to lift up my face to you, because our sins are higher than our heads and our guilt has reached to the heavens. "
"13840","Ezra","9","7","From the days of our ancestors until now, our guilt has been great. Because of our sins, we and our kings and our priests have been subjected to the sword and captivity, to pillage and humiliation at the hand of foreign kings, as it is today. "
"13841","Ezra","9","8","""But now, for a brief moment, the Lord our God has been gracious in leaving us a remnant and giving us a firm place9:8 Or a foothold in his sanctuary, and so our God gives light to our eyes and a little relief in our bondage. "
"13842","Ezra","9","9","Though we are slaves, our God has not forsaken us in our bondage. He has shown us kindness in the sight of the kings of Persia: He has granted us new life to rebuild the house of our God and repair its ruins, and he has given us a wall of protection in Judah and Jerusalem. "
"13843","Ezra","9","10","""But now, our God, what can we say after this? For we have forsaken the commands "
"13844","Ezra","9","11","you gave through your servants the prophets when you said: ‘The land you are entering to possess is a land polluted by the corruption of its peoples. By their detestable practices they have filled it with their impurity from one end to the other. "
"13845","Ezra","9","12","Therefore, do not give your daughters in marriage to their sons or take their daughters for your sons. Do not seek a treaty of friendship with them at any time, that you may be strong and eat the good things of the land and leave it to your children as an everlasting inheritance.’ "
"13846","Ezra","9","13","""What has happened to us is a result of our evil deeds and our great guilt, and yet, our God, you have punished us less than our sins deserved and have given us a remnant like this. "
"13847","Ezra","9","14","Shall we then break your commands again and intermarry with the peoples who commit such detestable practices? Would you not be angry enough with us to destroy us, leaving us no remnant or survivor? "
"13848","Ezra","9","15","Lord, the God of Israel, you are righteous! We are left this day as a remnant. Here we are before you in our guilt, though because of it not one of us can stand in your presence.”"
"13849","Ezra","10","1","While Ezra was praying and confessing, weeping and throwing himself down before the house of God, a large crowd of Israelites—men, women and children—gathered around him. They too wept bitterly. "
"13850","Ezra","10","2","Then Shekaniah son of Jehiel, one of the descendants of Elam, said to Ezra, “We have been unfaithful to our God by marrying foreign women from the peoples around us. But in spite of this, there is still hope for Israel. "
"13851","Ezra","10","3","Now let us make a covenant before our God to send away all these women and their children, in accordance with the counsel of my lord and of those who fear the commands of our God. Let it be done according to the Law. "
"13852","Ezra","10","4","Rise up; this matter is in your hands. We will support you, so take courage and do it.”"
"13853","Ezra","10","5","So Ezra rose up and put the leading priests and Levites and all Israel under oath to do what had been suggested. And they took the oath. "
"13854","Ezra","10","6","Then Ezra withdrew from before the house of God and went to the room of Jehohanan son of Eliashib. While he was there, he ate no food and drank no water, because he continued to mourn over the unfaithfulness of the exiles."
"13855","Ezra","10","7","A proclamation was then issued throughout Judah and Jerusalem for all the exiles to assemble in Jerusalem. "
"13856","Ezra","10","8","Anyone who failed to appear within three days would forfeit all his property, in accordance with the decision of the officials and elders, and would himself be expelled from the assembly of the exiles."
"13857","Ezra","10","9","Within the three days, all the men of Judah and Benjamin had gathered in Jerusalem. And on the twentieth day of the ninth month, all the people were sitting in the square before the house of God, greatly distressed by the occasion and because of the rain. "
"13858","Ezra","10","10","Then Ezra the priest stood up and said to them, “You have been unfaithful; you have married foreign women, adding to Israel’s guilt. "
"13859","Ezra","10","11","Now honor10:11 Or Now make confession to the Lord, the God of your ancestors, and do his will. Separate yourselves from the peoples around you and from your foreign wives.”"
"13860","Ezra","10","12","The whole assembly responded with a loud voice: “You are right! We must do as you say. "
"13861","Ezra","10","13","But there are many people here and it is the rainy season; so we cannot stand outside. Besides, this matter cannot be taken care of in a day or two, because we have sinned greatly in this thing. "
"13862","Ezra","10","14","Let our officials act for the whole assembly. Then let everyone in our towns who has married a foreign woman come at a set time, along with the elders and judges of each town, until the fierce anger of our God in this matter is turned away from us.” "
"13863","Ezra","10","15","Only Jonathan son of Asahel and Jahzeiah son of Tikvah, supported by Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite, opposed this."
"13864","Ezra","10","16","So the exiles did as was proposed. Ezra the priest selected men who were family heads, one from each family division, and all of them designated by name. On the first day of the tenth month they sat down to investigate the cases, "
"13865","Ezra","10","17","and by the first day of the first month they finished dealing with all the men who had married foreign women.Those Guilty of Intermarriage"
"13866","Ezra","10","18","Among the descendants of the priests, the following had married foreign women:From the descendants of Joshua son of Jozadak, and his brothers: Maaseiah, Eliezer, Jarib and Gedaliah. 19(They all gave their hands in pledge to put away their wives, and for their guilt they each presented a ram from the flock as a guilt offering.)"

"13895","Nehemiah","1","4","When I heard these things, I sat down and wept. For some days I mourned and fasted and prayed before the God of heaven. "

"13910","Nehemiah","2","8","And may I have a letter to Asaph, keeper of the royal park, so he will give me timber to make beams for the gates of the citadel by the temple and for the city wall and for the residence I will occupy?” And because the gracious hand of my God was on me, the king granted my requests. "
"13911","Nehemiah","2","9","So I went to the governors of Trans-Euphrates and gave them the king’s letters. The king had also sent army officers and cavalry with me."
"13912","Nehemiah","2","10","When Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite official heard about this, they were very much disturbed that someone had come to promote the welfare of the Israelites.Nehemiah Inspects Jerusalem’s Walls"
"13913","Nehemiah","2","11","I went to Jerusalem, and after staying there three days "
"13914","Nehemiah","2","12","I set out during the night with a few others. I had not told anyone what my God had put in my heart to do for Jerusalem. There were no mounts with me except the one I was riding on."
"13915","Nehemiah","2","13","By night I went out through the Valley Gate toward the Jackal2:13 Or Serpent or Fig Well and the Dung Gate, examining the walls of Jerusalem, which had been broken down, and its gates, which had been destroyed by fire. "
"13916","Nehemiah","2","14","Then I moved on toward the Fountain Gate and the King’s Pool, but there was not enough room for my mount to get through; "
"13917","Nehemiah","2","15","so I went up the valley by night, examining the wall. Finally, I turned back and reentered through the Valley Gate. "
"13918","Nehemiah","2","16","The officials did not know where I had gone or what I was doing, because as yet I had said nothing to the Jews or the priests or nobles or officials or any others who would be doing the work."
"13919","Nehemiah","2","17","Then I said to them, “You see the trouble we are in: Jerusalem lies in ruins, and its gates have been burned with fire. Come, let us rebuild the wall of Jerusalem, and we will no longer be in disgrace.” "
"13920","Nehemiah","2","18","I also told them about the gracious hand of my God on me and what the king had said to me.They replied, “Let us start rebuilding.” So they began this good work."
"13921","Nehemiah","2","19","But when Sanballat the Horonite, Tobiah the Ammonite official and Geshem the Arab heard about it, they mocked and ridiculed us. “What is this you are doing?” they asked. “Are you rebelling against the king?”"
"13922","Nehemiah","2","20","I answered them by saying, “The God of heaven will give us success. We his servants will start rebuilding, but as for you, you have no share in Jerusalem or any claim or historic right to it.”"
"13923","Nehemiah","3","1","Eliashib the high priest and his fellow priests went to work and rebuilt the Sheep Gate. They dedicated it and set its doors in place, building as far as the Tower of the Hundred, which they dedicated, and as far as the Tower of Hananel. "
"13924","Nehemiah","3","2","The men of Jericho built the adjoining section, and Zakkur son of Imri built next to them."

"13954","Nehemiah","3","32","and between the room above the corner and the Sheep Gate the goldsmiths and merchants made repairs."
"13955","Nehemiah","4","1","When Sanballat heard that we were rebuilding the wall, he became angry and was greatly incensed. He ridiculed the Jews, "
"13956","Nehemiah","4","2","and in the presence of his associates and the army of Samaria, he said, “What are those feeble Jews doing? Will they restore their wall? Will they offer sacrifices? Will they finish in a day? Can they bring the stones back to life from those heaps of rubble—burned as they are?”"
"13957","Nehemiah","4","3","Tobiah the Ammonite, who was at his side, said, “What they are building—even a fox climbing up on it would break down their wall of stones!”"
"13958","Nehemiah","4","4","Hear us, our God, for we are despised. Turn their insults back on their own heads. Give them over as plunder in a land of captivity. "
"13959","Nehemiah","4","5","Do not cover up their guilt or blot out their sins from your sight, for they have thrown insults in the face of4:5 Or have aroused your anger before the builders."
"13960","Nehemiah","4","6","So we rebuilt the wall till all of it reached half its height, for the people worked with all their heart."
"13961","Nehemiah","4","7","But when Sanballat, Tobiah, the Arabs, the Ammonites and the people of Ashdod heard that the repairs to Jerusalem’s walls had gone ahead and that the gaps were being closed, they were very angry. "
"13962","Nehemiah","4","8","They all plotted together to come and fight against Jerusalem and stir up trouble against it. "
"13963","Nehemiah","4","9","But we prayed to our God and posted a guard day and night to meet this threat."
"13964","Nehemiah","4","10","Meanwhile, the people in Judah said, “The strength of the laborers is giving out, and there is so much rubble that we cannot rebuild the wall.”"
"13965","Nehemiah","4","11","Also our enemies said, “Before they know it or see us, we will be right there among them and will kill them and put an end to the work.”"
"13966","Nehemiah","4","12","Then the Jews who lived near them came and told us ten times over, “Wherever you turn, they will attack us.”"
"13967","Nehemiah","4","13","Therefore I stationed some of the people behind the lowest points of the wall at the exposed places, posting them by families, with their swords, spears and bows. "
"13968","Nehemiah","4","14","After I looked things over, I stood up and said to the nobles, the officials and the rest of the people, “Don’t be afraid of them. Remember the Lord, who is great and awesome, and fight for your families, your sons and your daughters, your wives and your homes.”"
"13969","Nehemiah","4","15","When our enemies heard that we were aware of their plot and that God had frustrated it, we all returned to the wall, each to our own work."
"13970","Nehemiah","4","16","From that day on, half of my men did the work, while the other half were equipped with spears, shields, bows and armor. The officers posted themselves behind all the people of Judah "
"13971","Nehemiah","4","17","who were building the wall. Those who carried materials did their work with one hand and held a weapon in the other, "
"13972","Nehemiah","4","18","and each of the builders wore his sword at his side as he worked. But the man who sounded the trumpet stayed with me."
"13973","Nehemiah","4","19","Then I said to the nobles, the officials and the rest of the people, “The work is extensive and spread out, and we are widely separated from each other along the wall. "
"13974","Nehemiah","4","20","Wherever you hear the sound of the trumpet, join us there. Our God will fight for us!”"
"13975","Nehemiah","4","21","So we continued the work with half the men holding spears, from the first light of dawn till the stars came out. "
"13976","Nehemiah","4","22","At that time I also said to the people, “Have every man and his helper stay inside Jerusalem at night, so they can serve us as guards by night and as workers by day.” "
"13977","Nehemiah","4","23","Neither I nor my brothers nor my men nor the guards with me took off our clothes; each had his weapon, even when he went for water.4:23 The meaning of the Hebrew for this clause is uncertain."
"13978","Nehemiah","5","1","Now the men and their wives raised a great outcry against their fellow Jews. "
"13979","Nehemiah","5","2","Some were saying, “We and our sons and daughters are numerous; in order for us to eat and stay alive, we must get grain.”"
"13980","Nehemiah","5","3","Others were saying, “We are mortgaging our fields, our vineyards and our homes to get grain during the famine.”"
"13981","Nehemiah","5","4","Still others were saying, “We have had to borrow money to pay the king’s tax on our fields and vineyards. "
"13982","Nehemiah","5","5","Although we are of the same flesh and blood as our fellow Jews and though our children are as good as theirs, yet we have to subject our sons and daughters to slavery. Some of our daughters have already been enslaved, but we are powerless, because our fields and our vineyards belong to others.”"
"13983","Nehemiah","5","6","When I heard their outcry and these charges, I was very angry. "
"13984","Nehemiah","5","7","I pondered them in my mind and then accused the nobles and officials. I told them, “You are charging your own people interest!” So I called together a large meeting to deal with them "
"13985","Nehemiah","5","8","and said: “As far as possible, we have bought back our fellow Jews who were sold to the Gentiles. Now you are selling your own people, only for them to be sold back to us!” They kept quiet, because they could find nothing to say."
"13986","Nehemiah","5","9","So I continued, “What you are doing is not right. Shouldn’t you walk in the fear of our God to avoid the reproach of our Gentile enemies? "
"13987","Nehemiah","5","10","I and my brothers and my men are also lending the people money and grain. But let us stop charging interest! "
"13988","Nehemiah","5","11","Give back to them immediately their fields, vineyards, olive groves and houses, and also the interest you are charging them—one percent of the money, grain, new wine and olive oil.” "
"13989","Nehemiah","5","12","""We will give it back,” they said. “And we will not demand anything more from them. We will do as you say.”Then I summoned the priests and made the nobles and officials take an oath to do what they had promised. "
"13990","Nehemiah","5","13","I also shook out the folds of my robe and said, “In this way may God shake out of their house and possessions anyone who does not keep this promise. So may such a person be shaken out and emptied!”At this the whole assembly said, “Amen,” and praised the Lord. And the people did as they had promised."
"13991","Nehemiah","5","14","Moreover, from the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes, when I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, until his thirty-second year—twelve years—neither I nor my brothers ate the food allotted to the governor. "
"13992","Nehemiah","5","15","But the earlier governors—those preceding me—placed a heavy burden on the people and took forty shekels5:15 That is, about 1 pound or about 460 grams of silver from them in addition to food and wine. Their assistants also lorded it over the people. But out of reverence for God I did not act like that. "
"13993","Nehemiah","5","16","Instead, I devoted myself to the work on this wall. All my men were assembled there for the work; we5:16 Most Hebrew manuscripts; some Hebrew manuscripts, Septuagint, Vulgate and Syriac I did not acquire any land."
"13994","Nehemiah","5","17","Furthermore, a hundred and fifty Jews and officials ate at my table, as well as those who came to us from the surrounding nations. "
"13995","Nehemiah","5","18","Each day one ox, six choice sheep and some poultry were prepared for me, and every ten days an abundant supply of wine of all kinds. In spite of all this, I never demanded the food allotted to the governor, because the demands were heavy on these people."
"13996","Nehemiah","5","19","Remember me with favor, my God, for all I have done for these people."
"13997","Nehemiah","6","1","When word came to Sanballat, Tobiah, Geshem the Arab and the rest of our enemies that I had rebuilt the wall and not a gap was left in it—though up to that time I had not set the doors in the gates— "
"13998","Nehemiah","6","2","Sanballat and Geshem sent me this message: “Come, let us meet together in one of the villages6:2 Or in Kephirim on the plain of Ono.”But they were scheming to harm me; "
"13999","Nehemiah","6","3","so I sent messengers to them with this reply: “I am carrying on a great project and cannot go down. Why should the work stop while I leave it and go down to you?” "
"14000","Nehemiah","6","4","Four times they sent me the same message, and each time I gave them the same answer."
"14001","Nehemiah","6","5","Then, the fifth time, Sanballat sent his aide to me with the same message, and in his hand was an unsealed letter "
"14002","Nehemiah","6","6","in which was written:“It is reported among the nations—and Geshem6:6 Hebrew Gashmu, a variant of Geshem says it is true—that you and the Jews are plotting to revolt, and therefore you are building the wall. Moreover, according to these reports you are about to become their king "
"14003","Nehemiah","6","7","and have even appointed prophets to make this proclamation about you in Jerusalem: ‘There is a king in Judah!’ Now this report will get back to the king; so come, let us meet together.”"
"14004","Nehemiah","6","8","I sent him this reply: “Nothing like what you are saying is happening; you are just making it up out of your head.”"
"14005","Nehemiah","6","9","They were all trying to frighten us, thinking, “Their hands will get too weak for the work, and it will not be completed.”But I prayed, “Now strengthen my hands.”"
"14006","Nehemiah","6","10","One day I went to the house of Shemaiah son of Delaiah, the son of Mehetabel, who was shut in at his home. He said, “Let us meet in the house of God, inside the temple, and let us close the temple doors, because men are coming to kill you—by night they are coming to kill you.”"
"14007","Nehemiah","6","11","But I said, “Should a man like me run away? Or should someone like me go into the temple to save his life? I will not go!” "
"14008","Nehemiah","6","12","I realized that God had not sent him, but that he had prophesied against me because Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him. "
"14009","Nehemiah","6","13","He had been hired to intimidate me so that I would commit a sin by doing this, and then they would give me a bad name to discredit me."
"14010","Nehemiah","6","14","Remember Tobiah and Sanballat, my God, because of what they have done; remember also the prophet Noadiah and how she and the rest of the prophets have been trying to intimidate me. "
"14011","Nehemiah","6","15","So the wall was completed on the twenty-fifth of Elul, in fifty-two days.Opposition to the Completed Wall"
"14012","Nehemiah","6","16","When all our enemies heard about this, all the surrounding nations were afraid and lost their self-confidence, because they realized that this work had been done with the help of our God."
"14013","Nehemiah","6","17","Also, in those days the nobles of Judah were sending many letters to Tobiah, and replies from Tobiah kept coming to them. "
"14014","Nehemiah","6","18","For many in Judah were under oath to him, since he was son-in-law to Shekaniah son of Arah, and his son Jehohanan had married the daughter of Meshullam son of Berekiah. "
"14015","Nehemiah","6","19","Moreover, they kept reporting to me his good deeds and then telling him what I said. And Tobiah sent letters to intimidate me."
"14016","Nehemiah","7","1","After the wall had been rebuilt and I had set the doors in place, the gatekeepers, the musicians and the Levites were appointed. "
"14017","Nehemiah","7","2","I put in charge of Jerusalem my brother Hanani, along with Hananiah the commander of the citadel, because he was a man of integrity and feared God more than most people do. "
"14018","Nehemiah","7","3","I said to them, “The gates of Jerusalem are not to be opened until the sun is hot. While the gatekeepers are still on duty, have them shut the doors and bar them. Also appoint residents of Jerusalem as guards, some at their posts and some near their own houses.”The List of the Exiles Who Returned"
"14019","Nehemiah","7","4","Now the city was large and spacious, but there were few people in it, and the houses had not yet been rebuilt. "
"14020","Nehemiah","7","5","So my God put it into my heart to assemble the nobles, the officials and the common people for registration by families. I found the genealogical record of those who had been the first to return. This is what I found written there:"

"14239","Nehemiah","12","21","of Hilkiah’s, Hashabiah;of Jedaiah’s, Nethanel."
"14240","Nehemiah","12","22","The family heads of the Levites in the days of Eliashib, Joiada, Johanan and Jaddua, as well as those of the priests, were recorded in the reign of Darius the Persian. "
"14241","Nehemiah","12","23","The family heads among the descendants of Levi up to the time of Johanan son of Eliashib were recorded in the book of the annals. "
"14242","Nehemiah","12","24","And the leaders of the Levites were Hashabiah, Sherebiah, Jeshua son of Kadmiel, and their associates, who stood opposite them to give praise and thanksgiving, one section responding to the other, as prescribed by David the man of God."
"14243","Nehemiah","12","25","Mattaniah, Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon and Akkub were gatekeepers who guarded the storerooms at the gates. "
"14244","Nehemiah","12","26","They served in the days of Joiakim son of Joshua, the son of Jozadak, and in the days of Nehemiah the governor and of Ezra the priest, the teacher of the Law.Dedication of the Wall of Jerusalem"
"14245","Nehemiah","12","27","At the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem, the Levites were sought out from where they lived and were brought to Jerusalem to celebrate joyfully the dedication with songs of thanksgiving and with the music of cymbals, harps and lyres. "
"14246","Nehemiah","12","28","The musicians also were brought together from the region around Jerusalem—from the villages of the Netophathites, "
"14247","Nehemiah","12","29","from Beth Gilgal, and from the area of Geba and Azmaveth, for the musicians had built villages for themselves around Jerusalem. "
"14248","Nehemiah","12","30","When the priests and Levites had purified themselves ceremonially, they purified the people, the gates and the wall."
"14249","Nehemiah","12","31","I had the leaders of Judah go up on top of12:31 Or go alongside the wall. I also assigned two large choirs to give thanks. One was to proceed on top of12:31 Or proceed alongside the wall to the right, toward the Dung Gate. "
"14250","Nehemiah","12","32","Hoshaiah and half the leaders of Judah followed them, "
"14251","Nehemiah","12","33","along with Azariah, Ezra, Meshullam, "
"14252","Nehemiah","12","34","Judah, Benjamin, Shemaiah, Jeremiah, "
"14253","Nehemiah","12","35","as well as some priests with trumpets, and also Zechariah son of Jonathan, the son of Shemaiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Micaiah, the son of Zakkur, the son of Asaph, "
"14254","Nehemiah","12","36","and his associates—Shemaiah, Azarel, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethanel, Judah and Hanani—with musical instruments prescribed by David the man of God. Ezra the teacher of the Law led the procession. "
"14255","Nehemiah","12","37","At the Fountain Gate they continued directly up the steps of the City of David on the ascent to the wall and passed above the site of David’s palace to the Water Gate on the east."
"14256","Nehemiah","12","38","The second choir proceeded in the opposite direction. I followed them on top of12:38 Or them alongside the wall, together with half the people—past the Tower of the Ovens to the Broad Wall, "
"14257","Nehemiah","12","39","over the Gate of Ephraim, the Jeshanah12:39 Or Old Gate, the Fish Gate, the Tower of Hananel and the Tower of the Hundred, as far as the Sheep Gate. At the Gate of the Guard they stopped."
"14258","Nehemiah","12","40","The two choirs that gave thanks then took their places in the house of God; so did I, together with half the officials, "
"14259","Nehemiah","12","41","as well as the priests—Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Micaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah and Hananiah with their trumpets— "
"14260","Nehemiah","12","42","and also Maaseiah, Shemaiah, Eleazar, Uzzi, Jehohanan, Malkijah, Elam and Ezer. The choirs sang under the direction of Jezrahiah. "
"14261","Nehemiah","12","43","And on that day they offered great sacrifices, rejoicing because God had given them great joy. The women and children also rejoiced. The sound of rejoicing in Jerusalem could be heard far away."
"14262","Nehemiah","12","44","At that time men were appointed to be in charge of the storerooms for the contributions, firstfruits and tithes. From the fields around the towns they were to bring into the storerooms the portions required by the Law for the priests and the Levites, for Judah was pleased with the ministering priests and Levites. "
"14263","Nehemiah","12","45","They performed the service of their God and the service of purification, as did also the musicians and gatekeepers, according to the commands of David and his son Solomon. "
"14264","Nehemiah","12","46","For long ago, in the days of David and Asaph, there had been directors for the musicians and for the songs of praise and thanksgiving to God. "
"14265","Nehemiah","12","47","So in the days of Zerubbabel and of Nehemiah, all Israel contributed the daily portions for the musicians and the gatekeepers. They also set aside the portion for the other Levites, and the Levites set aside the portion for the descendants of Aaron."
"14266","Nehemiah","13","1","On that day the Book of Moses was read aloud in the hearing of the people and there it was found written that no Ammonite or Moabite should ever be admitted into the assembly of God, "
"14267","Nehemiah","13","2","because they had not met the Israelites with food and water but had hired Balaam to call a curse down on them. (Our God, however, turned the curse into a blessing.) "
"14268","Nehemiah","13","3","When the people heard this law, they excluded from Israel all who were of foreign descent."
"14269","Nehemiah","13","4","Before this, Eliashib the priest had been put in charge of the storerooms of the house of our God. He was closely associated with Tobiah, "
"14270","Nehemiah","13","5","and he had provided him with a large room formerly used to store the grain offerings and incense and temple articles, and also the tithes of grain, new wine and olive oil prescribed for the Levites, musicians and gatekeepers, as well as the contributions for the priests."
"14271","Nehemiah","13","6","But while all this was going on, I was not in Jerusalem, for in the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon I had returned to the king. Some time later I asked his permission "
"14272","Nehemiah","13","7","and came back to Jerusalem. Here I learned about the evil thing Eliashib had done in providing Tobiah a room in the courts of the house of God. "
"14273","Nehemiah","13","8","I was greatly displeased and threw all Tobiah’s household goods out of the room. "
"14274","Nehemiah","13","9","I gave orders to purify the rooms, and then I put back into them the equipment of the house of God, with the grain offerings and the incense."
"14275","Nehemiah","13","10","I also learned that the portions assigned to the Levites had not been given to them, and that all the Levites and musicians responsible for the service had gone back to their own fields. "
"14276","Nehemiah","13","11","So I rebuked the officials and asked them, “Why is the house of God neglected?” Then I called them together and stationed them at their posts."
"14277","Nehemiah","13","12","All Judah brought the tithes of grain, new wine and olive oil into the storerooms. "
"14278","Nehemiah","13","13","I put Shelemiah the priest, Zadok the scribe, and a Levite named Pedaiah in charge of the storerooms and made Hanan son of Zakkur, the son of Mattaniah, their assistant, because they were considered trustworthy. They were made responsible for distributing the supplies to their fellow Levites."
"14279","Nehemiah","13","14","Remember me for this, my God, and do not blot out what I have so faithfully done for the house of my God and its services."
"14280","Nehemiah","13","15","In those days I saw people in Judah treading winepresses on the Sabbath and bringing in grain and loading it on donkeys, together with wine, grapes, figs and all other kinds of loads. And they were bringing all this into Jerusalem on the Sabbath. Therefore I warned them against selling food on that day. "
"14281","Nehemiah","13","16","People from Tyre who lived in Jerusalem were bringing in fish and all kinds of merchandise and selling them in Jerusalem on the Sabbath to the people of Judah. "
"14282","Nehemiah","13","17","I rebuked the nobles of Judah and said to them, “What is this wicked thing you are doing—desecrating the Sabbath day? "
"14283","Nehemiah","13","18","Didn’t your ancestors do the same things, so that our God brought all this calamity on us and on this city? Now you are stirring up more wrath against Israel by desecrating the Sabbath.”"
"14284","Nehemiah","13","19","When evening shadows fell on the gates of Jerusalem before the Sabbath, I ordered the doors to be shut and not opened until the Sabbath was over. I stationed some of my own men at the gates so that no load could be brought in on the Sabbath day. "
"14285","Nehemiah","13","20","Once or twice the merchants and sellers of all kinds of goods spent the night outside Jerusalem. "
"14286","Nehemiah","13","21","But I warned them and said, “Why do you spend the night by the wall? If you do this again, I will arrest you.” From that time on they no longer came on the Sabbath. "
"14287","Nehemiah","13","22","Then I commanded the Levites to purify themselves and go and guard the gates in order to keep the Sabbath day holy.Remember me for this also, my God, and show mercy to me according to your great love."
"14288","Nehemiah","13","23","Moreover, in those days I saw men of Judah who had married women from Ashdod, Ammon and Moab. "
"14289","Nehemiah","13","24","Half of their children spoke the language of Ashdod or the language of one of the other peoples, and did not know how to speak the language of Judah. "
"14290","Nehemiah","13","25","I rebuked them and called curses down on them. I beat some of the men and pulled out their hair. I made them take an oath in God’s name and said: “You are not to give your daughters in marriage to their sons, nor are you to take their daughters in marriage for your sons or for yourselves. "
"14291","Nehemiah","13","26","Was it not because of marriages like these that Solomon king of Israel sinned? Among the many nations there was no king like him. He was loved by his God, and God made him king over all Israel, but even he was led into sin by foreign women. "
"14292","Nehemiah","13","27","Must we hear now that you too are doing all this terrible wickedness and are being unfaithful to our God by marrying foreign women?”"
"14293","Nehemiah","13","28","One of the sons of Joiada son of Eliashib the high priest was son-in-law to Sanballat the Horonite. And I drove him away from me."
"14294","Nehemiah","13","29","Remember them, my God, because they defiled the priestly office and the covenant of the priesthood and of the Levites."
"14295","Nehemiah","13","30","So I purified the priests and the Levites of everything foreign, and assigned them duties, each to his own task. "
"14296","Nehemiah","13","31","I also made provision for contributions of wood at designated times, and for the firstfruits.Remember me with favor, my God."
"14297","Esther","1","1","This is what happened during the time of Xerxes,1:1 Hebrew Ahasuerus; here and throughout Esther the Xerxes who ruled over 127 provinces stretching from India to Cush1:1 That is, the upper Nile region: "
"14298","Esther","1","2","At that time King Xerxes reigned from his royal throne in the citadel of Susa, "
"14299","Esther","1","3","and in the third year of his reign he gave a banquet for all his nobles and officials. The military leaders of Persia and Media, the princes, and the nobles of the provinces were present."
"14300","Esther","1","4","For a full 180 days he displayed the vast wealth of his kingdom and the splendor and glory of his majesty. "
"14301","Esther","1","5","When these days were over, the king gave a banquet, lasting seven days, in the enclosed garden of the king’s palace, for all the people from the least to the greatest who were in the citadel of Susa. "
"14302","Esther","1","6","The garden had hangings of white and blue linen, fastened with cords of white linen and purple material to silver rings on marble pillars. There were couches of gold and silver on a mosaic pavement of porphyry, marble, mother-of-pearl and other costly stones. "
"14303","Esther","1","7","Wine was served in goblets of gold, each one different from the other, and the royal wine was abundant, in keeping with the king’s liberality. "
"14304","Esther","1","8","By the king’s command each guest was allowed to drink with no restrictions, for the king instructed all the wine stewards to serve each man what he wished."
"14305","Esther","1","9","Queen Vashti also gave a banquet for the women in the royal palace of King Xerxes."
"14306","Esther","1","10","On the seventh day, when King Xerxes was in high spirits from wine, he commanded the seven eunuchs who served him—Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, Abagtha, Zethar and Karkas— "
"14307","Esther","1","11","to bring before him Queen Vashti, wearing her royal crown, in order to display her beauty to the people and nobles, for she was lovely to look at. "
"14308","Esther","1","12","But when the attendants delivered the king’s command, Queen Vashti refused to come. Then the king became furious and burned with anger."
"14309","Esther","1","13","Since it was customary for the king to consult experts in matters of law and justice, he spoke with the wise men who understood the times "
"14310","Esther","1","14","and were closest to the king—Karshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena and Memukan, the seven nobles of Persia and Media who had special access to the king and were highest in the kingdom. "
"14311","Esther","1","15","""According to law, what must be done to Queen Vashti?” he asked. “She has not obeyed the command of King Xerxes that the eunuchs have taken to her.”"
"14312","Esther","1","16","Then Memukan replied in the presence of the king and the nobles, “Queen Vashti has done wrong, not only against the king but also against all the nobles and the peoples of all the provinces of King Xerxes. "
"14313","Esther","1","17","For the queen’s conduct will become known to all the women, and so they will despise their husbands and say, ‘King Xerxes commanded Queen Vashti to be brought before him, but she would not come.’ "
"14314","Esther","1","18","This very day the Persian and Median women of the nobility who have heard about the queen’s conduct will respond to all the king’s nobles in the same way. There will be no end of disrespect and discord. "
"14315","Esther","1","19","""Therefore, if it pleases the king, let him issue a royal decree and let it be written in the laws of Persia and Media, which cannot be repealed, that Vashti is never again to enter the presence of King Xerxes. Also let the king give her royal position to someone else who is better than she. "
"14316","Esther","1","20","Then when the king’s edict is proclaimed throughout all his vast realm, all the women will respect their husbands, from the least to the greatest.”"
"14317","Esther","1","21","The king and his nobles were pleased with this advice, so the king did as Memukan proposed. "
"14318","Esther","1","22","He sent dispatches to all parts of the kingdom, to each province in its own script and to each people in their own language, proclaiming that every man should be ruler over his own household, using his native tongue."
"14319","Esther","2","1","Later when King Xerxes’ fury had subsided, he remembered Vashti and what she had done and what he had decreed about her. "
"14320","Esther","2","2","Then the king’s personal attendants proposed, “Let a search be made for beautiful young virgins for the king. "
"14321","Esther","2","3","Let the king appoint commissioners in every province of his realm to bring all these beautiful young women into the harem at the citadel of Susa. Let them be placed under the care of Hegai, the king’s eunuch, who is in charge of the women; and let beauty treatments be given to them. "
"14322","Esther","2","4","Then let the young woman who pleases the king be queen instead of Vashti.” This advice appealed to the king, and he followed it."
"14323","Esther","2","5","Now there was in the citadel of Susa a Jew of the tribe of Benjamin, named Mordecai son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, "
"14324","Esther","2","6","who had been carried into exile from Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, among those taken captive with Jehoiachin2:6 Hebrew Jeconiah, a variant of Jehoiachin king of Judah. "
"14325","Esther","2","7","Mordecai had a cousin named Hadassah, whom he had brought up because she had neither father nor mother. This young woman, who was also known as Esther, had a lovely figure and was beautiful. Mordecai had taken her as his own daughter when her father and mother died."
"14326","Esther","2","8","When the king’s order and edict had been proclaimed, many young women were brought to the citadel of Susa and put under the care of Hegai. Esther also was taken to the king’s palace and entrusted to Hegai, who had charge of the harem. "
"14327","Esther","2","9","She pleased him and won his favor. Immediately he provided her with her beauty treatments and special food. He assigned to her seven female attendants selected from the king’s palace and moved her and her attendants into the best place in the harem."
"14328","Esther","2","10","Esther had not revealed her nationality and family background, because Mordecai had forbidden her to do so. "
"14329","Esther","2","11","Every day he walked back and forth near the courtyard of the harem to find out how Esther was and what was happening to her."
"14330","Esther","2","12","Before a young woman’s turn came to go in to King Xerxes, she had to complete twelve months of beauty treatments prescribed for the women, six months with oil of myrrh and six with perfumes and cosmetics. "
"14331","Esther","2","13","And this is how she would go to the king: Anything she wanted was given her to take with her from the harem to the king’s palace. "
"14332","Esther","2","14","In the evening she would go there and in the morning return to another part of the harem to the care of Shaashgaz, the king’s eunuch who was in charge of the concubines. She would not return to the king unless he was pleased with her and summoned her by name."
"14333","Esther","2","15","When the turn came for Esther (the young woman Mordecai had adopted, the daughter of his uncle Abihail) to go to the king, she asked for nothing other than what Hegai, the king’s eunuch who was in charge of the harem, suggested. And Esther won the favor of everyone who saw her. "
"14334","Esther","2","16","She was taken to King Xerxes in the royal residence in the tenth month, the month of Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign."
"14335","Esther","2","17","Now the king was attracted to Esther more than to any of the other women, and she won his favor and approval more than any of the other virgins. So he set a royal crown on her head and made her queen instead of Vashti. "
"14336","Esther","2","18","And the king gave a great banquet, Esther’s banquet, for all his nobles and officials. He proclaimed a holiday throughout the provinces and distributed gifts with royal liberality.Mordecai Uncovers a Conspiracy"
"14337","Esther","2","19","When the virgins were assembled a second time, Mordecai was sitting at the king’s gate. "
"14338","Esther","2","20","But Esther had kept secret her family background and nationality just as Mordecai had told her to do, for she continued to follow Mordecai’s instructions as she had done when he was bringing her up."
"14339","Esther","2","21","During the time Mordecai was sitting at the king’s gate, Bigthana2:21 Hebrew Bigthan, a variant of Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king’s officers who guarded the doorway, became angry and conspired to assassinate King Xerxes. "
"14340","Esther","2","22","But Mordecai found out about the plot and told Queen Esther, who in turn reported it to the king, giving credit to Mordecai. "
"14341","Esther","2","23","And when the report was investigated and found to be true, the two officials were impaled on poles. All this was recorded in the book of the annals in the presence of the king."
"14342","Esther","3","1","After these events, King Xerxes honored Haman son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, elevating him and giving him a seat of honor higher than that of all the other nobles. "
"14343","Esther","3","2","All the royal officials at the king’s gate knelt down and paid honor to Haman, for the king had commanded this concerning him. But Mordecai would not kneel down or pay him honor."
"14344","Esther","3","3","Then the royal officials at the king’s gate asked Mordecai, “Why do you disobey the king’s command?” "
"14345","Esther","3","4","Day after day they spoke to him but he refused to comply. Therefore they told Haman about it to see whether Mordecai’s behavior would be tolerated, for he had told them he was a Jew."
"14346","Esther","3","5","When Haman saw that Mordecai would not kneel down or pay him honor, he was enraged. "
"14347","Esther","3","6","Yet having learned who Mordecai’s people were, he scorned the idea of killing only Mordecai. Instead Haman looked for a way to destroy all Mordecai’s people, the Jews, throughout the whole kingdom of Xerxes."
"14348","Esther","3","7","In the twelfth year of King Xerxes, in the first month, the month of Nisan, the pur (that is, the lot) was cast in the presence of Haman to select a day and month. And the lot fell on3:7 Septuagint; Hebrew does not have And the lot fell on. the twelfth month, the month of Adar."
"14349","Esther","3","8","Then Haman said to King Xerxes, “There is a certain people dispersed among the peoples in all the provinces of your kingdom who keep themselves separate. Their customs are different from those of all other people, and they do not obey the king’s laws; it is not in the king’s best interest to tolerate them. "
"14350","Esther","3","9","If it pleases the king, let a decree be issued to destroy them, and I will give ten thousand talents3:9 That is, about 375 tons or about 340 metric tons of silver to the king’s administrators for the royal treasury.”"
"14351","Esther","3","10","So the king took his signet ring from his finger and gave it to Haman son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of the Jews.  "
"14352","Esther","3","11","""Keep the money,” the king said to Haman, “and do with the people as you please.”"
"14353","Esther","3","12","Then on the thirteenth day of the first month the royal secretaries were summoned. They wrote out in the script of each province and in the language of each people all Haman’s orders to the king’s satraps, the governors of the various provinces and the nobles of the various peoples. These were written in the name of King Xerxes himself and sealed with his own ring. "
"14354","Esther","3","13","Dispatches were sent by couriers to all the king’s provinces with the order to destroy, kill and annihilate all the Jews—young and old, women and children—on a single day, the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, the month of Adar, and to plunder their goods. "
"14355","Esther","3","14","A copy of the text of the edict was to be issued as law in every province and made known to the people of every nationality so they would be ready for that day."
"14356","Esther","3","15","The couriers went out, spurred on by the king’s command, and the edict was issued in the citadel of Susa. The king and Haman sat down to drink, but the city of Susa was bewildered."
"14357","Esther","4","1","When Mordecai learned of all that had been done, he tore his clothes, put on sackcloth and ashes, and went out into the city, wailing loudly and bitterly. "
"14358","Esther","4","2","But he went only as far as the king’s gate, because no one clothed in sackcloth was allowed to enter it. "
"14359","Esther","4","3","In every province to which the edict and order of the king came, there was great mourning among the Jews, with fasting, weeping and wailing. Many lay in sackcloth and ashes."
"14360","Esther","4","4","When Esther’s eunuchs and female attendants came and told her about Mordecai, she was in great distress. She sent clothes for him to put on instead of his sackcloth, but he would not accept them. "
"14361","Esther","4","5","Then Esther summoned Hathak, one of the king’s eunuchs assigned to attend her, and ordered him to find out what was troubling Mordecai and why."
"14362","Esther","4","6","So Hathak went out to Mordecai in the open square of the city in front of the king’s gate. "
"14363","Esther","4","7","Mordecai told him everything that had happened to him, including the exact amount of money Haman had promised to pay into the royal treasury for the destruction of the Jews. "
"14364","Esther","4","8","He also gave him a copy of the text of the edict for their annihilation, which had been published in Susa, to show to Esther and explain it to her, and he told him to instruct her to go into the king’s presence to beg for mercy and plead with him for her people."
"14365","Esther","4","9","Hathak went back and reported to Esther what Mordecai had said. "
"14366","Esther","4","10","Then she instructed him to say to Mordecai,  "
"14367","Esther","4","11","""All the king’s officials and the people of the royal provinces know that for any man or woman who approaches the king in the inner court without being summoned the king has but one law: that they be put to death unless the king extends the gold scepter to them and spares their lives. But thirty days have passed since I was called to go to the king.”"
"14368","Esther","4","12","When Esther’s words were reported to Mordecai, "
"14369","Esther","4","13","he sent back this answer: “Do not think that because you are in the king’s house you alone of all the Jews will escape. "
"14370","Esther","4","14","For if you remain silent at this time, relief and deliverance for the Jews will arise from another place, but you and your father’s family will perish. And who knows but that you have come to your royal position for such a time as this?”"
"14371","Esther","4","15","Then Esther sent this reply to Mordecai:  "
"14372","Esther","4","16","""Go, gather together all the Jews who are in Susa, and fast for me. Do not eat or drink for three days, night or day. I and my attendants will fast as you do. When this is done, I will go to the king, even though it is against the law. And if I perish, I perish.”"
"14373","Esther","4","17","So Mordecai went away and carried out all of Esther’s instructions."
"14374","Esther","5","1","On the third day Esther put on her royal robes and stood in the inner court of the palace, in front of the king’s hall. The king was sitting on his royal throne in the hall, facing the entrance. "
"14375","Esther","5","2","When he saw Queen Esther standing in the court, he was pleased with her and held out to her the gold scepter that was in his hand. So Esther approached and touched the tip of the scepter."
"14376","Esther","5","3","Then the king asked, “What is it, Queen Esther? What is your request? Even up to half the kingdom, it will be given you.” "
"14377","Esther","5","4","""If it pleases the king,” replied Esther, “let the king, together with Haman, come today to a banquet I have prepared for him.” "
"14378","Esther","5","5","""Bring Haman at once,” the king said, “so that we may do what Esther asks.”So the king and Haman went to the banquet Esther had prepared. "
"14379","Esther","5","6","As they were drinking wine, the king again asked Esther, “Now what is your petition? It will be given you. And what is your request? Even up to half the kingdom, it will be granted.”"
"14380","Esther","5","7","Esther replied, “My petition and my request is this: "
"14381","Esther","5","8","If the king regards me with favor and if it pleases the king to grant my petition and fulfill my request, let the king and Haman come tomorrow to the banquet I will prepare for them. Then I will answer the king’s question.”Haman’s Rage Against Mordecai"
"14382","Esther","5","9","Haman went out that day happy and in high spirits. But when he saw Mordecai at the king’s gate and observed that he neither rose nor showed fear in his presence, he was filled with rage against Mordecai. "
"14383","Esther","5","10","Nevertheless, Haman restrained himself and went home.Calling together his friends and Zeresh, his wife, "
"14384","Esther","5","11","Haman boasted to them about his vast wealth, his many sons, and all the ways the king had honored him and how he had elevated him above the other nobles and officials.  "
"14385","Esther","5","12","""And that’s not all,” Haman added. “I’m the only person Queen Esther invited to accompany the king to the banquet she gave. And she has invited me along with the king tomorrow. "
"14386","Esther","5","13","But all this gives me no satisfaction as long as I see that Jew Mordecai sitting at the king’s gate.”"
"14387","Esther","5","14","His wife Zeresh and all his friends said to him, “Have a pole set up, reaching to a height of fifty cubits,5:14 That is, about 75 feet or about 23 meters and ask the king in the morning to have Mordecai impaled on it. Then go with the king to the banquet and enjoy yourself.” This suggestion delighted Haman, and he had the pole set up."
"14388","Esther","6","1","That night the king could not sleep; so he ordered the book of the chronicles, the record of his reign, to be brought in and read to him. "
"14389","Esther","6","2","It was found recorded there that Mordecai had exposed Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king’s officers who guarded the doorway, who had conspired to assassinate King Xerxes. "
"14390","Esther","6","3","""What honor and recognition has Mordecai received for this?” the king asked.“Nothing has been done for him,” his attendants answered."
"14391","Esther","6","4","The king said, “Who is in the court?” Now Haman had just entered the outer court of the palace to speak to the king about impaling Mordecai on the pole he had set up for him."
"14392","Esther","6","5","His attendants answered, “Haman is standing in the court.”“Bring him in,” the king ordered."
"14393","Esther","6","6","When Haman entered, the king asked him, “What should be done for the man the king delights to honor?”Now Haman thought to himself, “Who is there that the king would rather honor than me?” "
"14394","Esther","6","7","So he answered the king, “For the man the king delights to honor, "
"14395","Esther","6","8","have them bring a royal robe the king has worn and a horse the king has ridden, one with a royal crest placed on its head. "
"14396","Esther","6","9","Then let the robe and horse be entrusted to one of the king’s most noble princes. Let them robe the man the king delights to honor, and lead him on the horse through the city streets, proclaiming before him, ‘This is what is done for the man the king delights to honor!’ ” "
"14397","Esther","6","10","""Go at once,” the king commanded Haman. “Get the robe and the horse and do just as you have suggested for Mordecai the Jew, who sits at the king’s gate. Do not neglect anything you have recommended.”"
"14398","Esther","6","11","So Haman got the robe and the horse. He robed Mordecai, and led him on horseback through the city streets, proclaiming before him, “This is what is done for the man the king delights to honor!”"
"14399","Esther","6","12","Afterward Mordecai returned to the king’s gate. But Haman rushed home, with his head covered in grief, "
"14400","Esther","6","13","and told Zeresh his wife and all his friends everything that had happened to him.His advisers and his wife Zeresh said to him, “Since Mordecai, before whom your downfall has started, is of Jewish origin, you cannot stand against him—you will surely come to ruin!” "
"14401","Esther","6","14","While they were still talking with him, the king’s eunuchs arrived and hurried Haman away to the banquet Esther had prepared."
"14402","Esther","7","1","So the king and Haman went to Queen Esther’s banquet, "
"14403","Esther","7","2","and as they were drinking wine on the second day, the king again asked, “Queen Esther, what is your petition? It will be given you. What is your request? Even up to half the kingdom, it will be granted.”"
"14404","Esther","7","3","Then Queen Esther answered, “If I have found favor with you, Your Majesty, and if it pleases you, grant me my life—this is my petition. And spare my people—this is my request. "
"14405","Esther","7","4","For I and my people have been sold to be destroyed, killed and annihilated. If we had merely been sold as male and female slaves, I would have kept quiet, because no such distress would justify disturbing the king.7:4 Or quiet, but the compensation our adversary offers cannot be compared with the loss the king would suffer”"
"14406","Esther","7","5","King Xerxes asked Queen Esther, “Who is he? Where is he—the man who has dared to do such a thing?”"
"14407","Esther","7","6","Esther said, “An adversary and enemy! This vile Haman!”Then Haman was terrified before the king and queen. "
"14408","Esther","7","7","The king got up in a rage, left his wine and went out into the palace garden. But Haman, realizing that the king had already decided his fate, stayed behind to beg Queen Esther for his life."
"14409","Esther","7","8","Just as the king returned from the palace garden to the banquet hall, Haman was falling on the couch where Esther was reclining.The king exclaimed, “Will he even molest the queen while she is with me in the house?”As soon as the word left the king’s mouth, they covered Haman’s face. "
"14410","Esther","7","9","Then Harbona, one of the eunuchs attending the king, said, “A pole reaching to a height of fifty cubits7:9 That is, about 75 feet or about 23 meters stands by Haman’s house. He had it set up for Mordecai, who spoke up to help the king.”The king said, “Impale him on it!” "
"14411","Esther","7","10","So they impaled Haman on the pole he had set up for Mordecai. Then the king’s fury subsided."
"14412","Esther","8","1","That same day King Xerxes gave Queen Esther the estate of Haman, the enemy of the Jews. And Mordecai came into the presence of the king, for Esther had told how he was related to her. "
"14413","Esther","8","2","The king took off his signet ring, which he had reclaimed from Haman, and presented it to Mordecai. And Esther appointed him over Haman’s estate."
"14414","Esther","8","3","Esther again pleaded with the king, falling at his feet and weeping. She begged him to put an end to the evil plan of Haman the Agagite, which he had devised against the Jews. "
"14415","Esther","8","4","Then the king extended the gold scepter to Esther and she arose and stood before him. "
"14416","Esther","8","5","""If it pleases the king,” she said, “and if he regards me with favor and thinks it the right thing to do, and if he is pleased with me, let an order be written overruling the dispatches that Haman son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, devised and wrote to destroy the Jews in all the king’s provinces. "
"14417","Esther","8","6","For how can I bear to see disaster fall on my people? How can I bear to see the destruction of my family?”"
"14418","Esther","8","7","King Xerxes replied to Queen Esther and to Mordecai the Jew, “Because Haman attacked the Jews, I have given his estate to Esther, and they have impaled him on the pole he set up. "
"14419","Esther","8","8","Now write another decree in the king’s name in behalf of the Jews as seems best to you, and seal it with the king’s signet ring—for no document written in the king’s name and sealed with his ring can be revoked.”"
"14420","Esther","8","9","At once the royal secretaries were summoned—on the twenty-third day of the third month, the month of Sivan. They wrote out all Mordecai’s orders to the Jews, and to the satraps, governors and nobles of the 127 provinces stretching from India to Cush.8:9 That is, the upper Nile region These orders were written in the script of each province and the language of each people and also to the Jews in their own script and language. "
"14421","Esther","8","10","Mordecai wrote in the name of King Xerxes, sealed the dispatches with the king’s signet ring, and sent them by mounted couriers, who rode fast horses especially bred for the king."
"14422","Esther","8","11","The king’s edict granted the Jews in every city the right to assemble and protect themselves; to destroy, kill and annihilate the armed men of any nationality or province who might attack them and their women and children,8:11 Or province, together with their women and children, who might attack them; and to plunder the property of their enemies. "
"14423","Esther","8","12","The day appointed for the Jews to do this in all the provinces of King Xerxes was the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, the month of Adar. "
"14424","Esther","8","13","A copy of the text of the edict was to be issued as law in every province and made known to the people of every nationality so that the Jews would be ready on that day to avenge themselves on their enemies."
"14425","Esther","8","14","The couriers, riding the royal horses, went out, spurred on by the king’s command, and the edict was issued in the citadel of Susa.The Triumph of the Jews"
"14426","Esther","8","15","When Mordecai left the king’s presence, he was wearing royal garments of blue and white, a large crown of gold and a purple robe of fine linen. And the city of Susa held a joyous celebration. "
"14427","Esther","8","16","For the Jews it was a time of happiness and joy, gladness and honor. "
"14428","Esther","8","17","In every province and in every city to which the edict of the king came, there was joy and gladness among the Jews, with feasting and celebrating. And many people of other nationalities became Jews because fear of the Jews had seized them."
"14429","Esther","9","1","On the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, the month of Adar, the edict commanded by the king was to be carried out. On this day the enemies of the Jews had hoped to overpower them, but now the tables were turned and the Jews got the upper hand over those who hated them. "
"14430","Esther","9","2","The Jews assembled in their cities in all the provinces of King Xerxes to attack those determined to destroy them. No one could stand against them, because the people of all the other nationalities were afraid of them. "
"14431","Esther","9","3","And all the nobles of the provinces, the satraps, the governors and the king’s administrators helped the Jews, because fear of Mordecai had seized them. "
"14432","Esther","9","4","Mordecai was prominent in the palace; his reputation spread throughout the provinces, and he became more and more powerful."
"14433","Esther","9","5","The Jews struck down all their enemies with the sword, killing and destroying them, and they did what they pleased to those who hated them. "
"14434","Esther","9","6","In the citadel of Susa, the Jews killed and destroyed five hundred men. "
"14435","Esther","9","7","They also killed Parshandatha, Dalphon, Aspatha, "
"14436","Esther","9","8","Poratha, Adalia, Aridatha, "
"14437","Esther","9","9","Parmashta, Arisai, Aridai and Vaizatha, "
"14438","Esther","9","10","the ten sons of Haman son of Hammedatha, the enemy of the Jews. But they did not lay their hands on the plunder."
"14439","Esther","9","11","The number of those killed in the citadel of Susa was reported to the king that same day. "
"14440","Esther","9","12","The king said to Queen Esther, “The Jews have killed and destroyed five hundred men and the ten sons of Haman in the citadel of Susa. What have they done in the rest of the king’s provinces? Now what is your petition? It will be given you. What is your request? It will also be granted.” "
"14441","Esther","9","13","""If it pleases the king,” Esther answered, “give the Jews in Susa permission to carry out this day’s edict tomorrow also, and let Haman’s ten sons be impaled on poles.”"
"14442","Esther","9","14","So the king commanded that this be done. An edict was issued in Susa, and they impaled the ten sons of Haman. "
"14443","Esther","9","15","The Jews in Susa came together on the fourteenth day of the month of Adar, and they put to death in Susa three hundred men, but they did not lay their hands on the plunder."
"14444","Esther","9","16","Meanwhile, the remainder of the Jews who were in the king’s provinces also assembled to protect themselves and get relief from their enemies. They killed seventy-five thousand of them but did not lay their hands on the plunder. "
"14445","Esther","9","17","This happened on the thirteenth day of the month of Adar, and on the fourteenth they rested and made it a day of feasting and joy."
"14446","Esther","9","18","The Jews in Susa, however, had assembled on the thirteenth and fourteenth, and then on the fifteenth they rested and made it a day of feasting and joy."
"14447","Esther","9","19","That is why rural Jews—those living in villages—observe the fourteenth of the month of Adar as a day of joy and feasting, a day for giving presents to each other.Purim Established"
"14448","Esther","9","20","Mordecai recorded these events, and he sent letters to all the Jews throughout the provinces of King Xerxes, near and far, "
"14449","Esther","9","21","to have them celebrate annually the fourteenth and fifteenth days of the month of Adar "
"14450","Esther","9","22","as the time when the Jews got relief from their enemies, and as the month when their sorrow was turned into joy and their mourning into a day of celebration. He wrote them to observe the days as days of feasting and joy and giving presents of food to one another and gifts to the poor."
"14451","Esther","9","23","So the Jews agreed to continue the celebration they had begun, doing what Mordecai had written to them. "
"14452","Esther","9","24","For Haman son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had plotted against the Jews to destroy them and had cast the pur (that is, the lot) for their ruin and destruction. "
"14453","Esther","9","25","But when the plot came to the king’s attention,9:25 Or when Esther came before the king he issued written orders that the evil scheme Haman had devised against the Jews should come back onto his own head, and that he and his sons should be impaled on poles. 26(Therefore these days were called Purim, from the word pur.) Because of everything written in this letter and because of what they had seen and what had happened to them, "
"14454","Esther","9","27","the Jews took it on themselves to establish the custom that they and their descendants and all who join them should without fail observe these two days every year, in the way prescribed and at the time appointed. "
"14455","Esther","9","28","These days should be remembered and observed in every generation by every family, and in every province and in every city. And these days of Purim should never fail to be celebrated by the Jews—nor should the memory of these days die out among their descendants."
"14456","Esther","9","29","So Queen Esther, daughter of Abihail, along with Mordecai the Jew, wrote with full authority to confirm this second letter concerning Purim. "
"14457","Esther","9","30","And Mordecai sent letters to all the Jews in the 127 provinces of Xerxes’ kingdom—words of goodwill and assurance— "
"14458","Esther","9","31","to establish these days of Purim at their designated times, as Mordecai the Jew and Queen Esther had decreed for them, and as they had established for themselves and their descendants in regard to their times of fasting and lamentation. "
"14459","Esther","9","32","Esther’s decree confirmed these regulations about Purim, and it was written down in the records."
"14460","Esther","10","1","King Xerxes imposed tribute throughout the empire, to its distant shores. "
"14461","Esther","10","2","And all his acts of power and might, together with a full account of the greatness of Mordecai, whom the king had promoted, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Media and Persia? "
"14462","Esther","10","3","Mordecai the Jew was second in rank to King Xerxes, preeminent among the Jews, and held in high esteem by his many fellow Jews, because he worked for the good of his people and spoke up for the welfare of all the Jews."
"14463","Job","1","1","In the land of Uz there lived a man whose name was Job. This man was blameless and upright; he feared God and shunned evil. "
"14464","Job","1","2","He had seven sons and three daughters, "
"14465","Job","1","3","and he owned seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen and five hundred donkeys, and had a large number of servants. He was the greatest man among all the people of the East."
"14466","Job","1","4","His sons used to hold feasts in their homes on their birthdays, and they would invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them. "
"14467","Job","1","5","When a period of feasting had run its course, Job would make arrangements for them to be purified. Early in the morning he would sacrifice a burnt offering for each of them, thinking, “Perhaps my children have sinned and cursed God in their hearts.” This was Job’s regular custom."
"14468","Job","1","6","One day the angels1:6 Hebrew the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan1:6 Hebrew satan means adversary. also came with them. "
"14469","Job","1","7","The Lord said to Satan, “Where have you come from?”Satan answered the Lord, “From roaming throughout the earth, going back and forth on it.”"
"14470","Job","1","8","Then the Lord said to Satan, “Have you considered my servant Job? There is no one on earth like him; he is blameless and upright, a man who fears God and shuns evil.” "
"14471","Job","1","9","""Does Job fear God for nothing?” Satan replied.  "
"14472","Job","1","10","""Have you not put a hedge around him and his household and everything he has? You have blessed the work of his hands, so that his flocks and herds are spread throughout the land. "
"14473","Job","1","11","But now stretch out your hand and strike everything he has, and he will surely curse you to your face.”"
"14474","Job","1","12","The Lord said to Satan, “Very well, then, everything he has is in your power, but on the man himself do not lay a finger.”Then Satan went out from the presence of the Lord."
"14475","Job","1","13","One day when Job’s sons and daughters were feasting and drinking wine at the oldest brother’s house, "
"14476","Job","1","14","a messenger came to Job and said, “The oxen were plowing and the donkeys were grazing nearby, "
"14477","Job","1","15","and the Sabeans attacked and made off with them. They put the servants to the sword, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!”"
"14478","Job","1","16","While he was still speaking, another messenger came and said, “The fire of God fell from the heavens and burned up the sheep and the servants, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!”"
"14479","Job","1","17","While he was still speaking, another messenger came and said, “The Chaldeans formed three raiding parties and swept down on your camels and made off with them. They put the servants to the sword, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!”"
"14480","Job","1","18","While he was still speaking, yet another messenger came and said, “Your sons and daughters were feasting and drinking wine at the oldest brother’s house, "
"14481","Job","1","19","when suddenly a mighty wind swept in from the desert and struck the four corners of the house. It collapsed on them and they are dead, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!”"
"14482","Job","1","20","At this, Job got up and tore his robe and shaved his head. Then he fell to the ground in worship "
"14483","Job","1","21","and said:“Naked I came from my mother’s womb,and naked I will depart.1:21 Or will return thereThe Lord gave and the Lord has taken away;may the name of the Lord be praised.”"
"14484","Job","1","22","In all this, Job did not sin by charging God with wrongdoing."
"14485","Job","2","1","On another day the angels2:1 Hebrew the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan also came with them to present himself before him. "
"14486","Job","2","2","And the Lord said to Satan, “Where have you come from?”Satan answered the Lord, “From roaming throughout the earth, going back and forth on it.”"
"14487","Job","2","3","Then the Lord said to Satan, “Have you considered my servant Job? There is no one on earth like him; he is blameless and upright, a man who fears God and shuns evil. And he still maintains his integrity, though you incited me against him to ruin him without any reason.” "
"14488","Job","2","4","""Skin for skin!” Satan replied. “A man will give all he has for his own life. "
"14489","Job","2","5","But now stretch out your hand and strike his flesh and bones, and he will surely curse you to your face.”"
"14490","Job","2","6","The Lord said to Satan, “Very well, then, he is in your hands; but you must spare his life.”"
"14491","Job","2","7","So Satan went out from the presence of the Lord and afflicted Job with painful sores from the soles of his feet to the crown of his head. "
"14492","Job","2","8","Then Job took a piece of broken pottery and scraped himself with it as he sat among the ashes."
"14493","Job","2","9","His wife said to him, “Are you still maintaining your integrity? Curse God and die!”"
"14494","Job","2","10","He replied, “You are talking like a foolish2:10 The Hebrew word rendered foolish denotes moral deficiency. woman. Shall we accept good from God, and not trouble?”In all this, Job did not sin in what he said."
"14495","Job","2","11","When Job’s three friends, Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite, heard about all the troubles that had come upon him, they set out from their homes and met together by agreement to go and sympathize with him and comfort him. "
"14496","Job","2","12","When they saw him from a distance, they could hardly recognize him; they began to weep aloud, and they tore their robes and sprinkled dust on their heads. "
"14497","Job","2","13","Then they sat on the ground with him for seven days and seven nights. No one said a word to him, because they saw how great his suffering was."
"14498","Job","3","1","After this, Job opened his mouth and cursed the day of his birth. "
"14499","Job","3","2","He said: "
"14500","Job","3","3","""May the day of my birth perish,and the night that said, ‘A boy is conceived!’"

"14508","Job","3","11","""Why did I not perish at birth,and die as I came from the womb?"
"14509","Job","3","12","Why were there knees to receive meand breasts that I might be nursed?"

"14815","Job","15","21","Terrifying sounds fill his ears;when all seems well, marauders attack him."
"14816","Job","15","22","He despairs of escaping the realm of darkness;he is marked for the sword."
"14817","Job","15","23","He wanders about for food like a vulture;he knows the day of darkness is at hand."
"14818","Job","15","24","Distress and anguish fill him with terror;troubles overwhelm him, like a king poised to attack,"
"14819","Job","15","25","because he shakes his fist at Godand vaunts himself against the Almighty,"

"14856","Job","17","5","If anyone denounces their friends for reward,the eyes of their children will fail. "
"14857","Job","17","6","""God has made me a byword to everyone,a man in whose face people spit."
"14858","Job","17","7","My eyes have grown dim with grief;my whole frame is but a shadow."
"14859","Job","17","8","The upright are appalled at this;the innocent are aroused against the ungodly."

"14879","Job","18","12","Calamity is hungry for him;disaster is ready for him when he falls."
"14880","Job","18","13","It eats away parts of his skin;death’s firstborn devours his limbs."
"14881","Job","18","14","He is torn from the security of his tentand marched off to the king of terrors."
"14882","Job","18","15","Fire resides18:15 Or Nothing he had remains in his tent;burning sulfur is scattered over his dwelling."

"14886","Job","18","19","He has no offspring or descendants among his people,no survivor where once he lived."
"14887","Job","18","20","People of the west are appalled at his fate;those of the east are seized with horror."
"14888","Job","18","21","Surely such is the dwelling of an evil man;such is the place of one who does not know God.”"
"14889","Job","19","1","Then Job replied: "

"15009","Job","22","30","He will deliver even one who is not innocent,who will be delivered through the cleanness of your hands.”"
"15010","Job","23","1","Then Job replied: "

"15013","Job","23","4","I would state my case before himand fill my mouth with arguments."
"15014","Job","23","5","I would find out what he would answer me,and consider what he would say to me."

"15025","Job","23","16","God has made my heart faint;the Almighty has terrified me."
"15026","Job","23","17","Yet I am not silenced by the darkness,by the thick darkness that covers my face."
"15027","Job","24","1","""Why does the Almighty not set times for judgment?Why must those who know him look in vain for such days?"
"15028","Job","24","2","There are those who move boundary stones;they pasture flocks they have stolen."
"15029","Job","24","3","They drive away the orphan’s donkeyand take the widow’s ox in pledge."

"15078","Job","27","7","""May my enemy be like the wicked,my adversary like the unjust!"
"15079","Job","27","8","For what hope have the godless when they are cut off,when God takes away their life?"

"18941","Ecclesiastes","2","3","I tried cheering myself with wine, and embracing folly—my mind still guiding me with wisdom. I wanted to see what was good for people to do under the heavens during the few days of their lives."
"18942","Ecclesiastes","2","4","I undertook great projects: I built houses for myself and planted vineyards. "
"18943","Ecclesiastes","2","5","I made gardens and parks and planted all kinds of fruit trees in them. "
"18944","Ecclesiastes","2","6","I made reservoirs to water groves of flourishing trees. "
"18945","Ecclesiastes","2","7","I bought male and female slaves and had other slaves who were born in my house. I also owned more herds and flocks than anyone in Jerusalem before me. "
"18946","Ecclesiastes","2","8","I amassed silver and gold for myself, and the treasure of kings and provinces. I acquired male and female singers, and a harem2:8 The meaning of the Hebrew for this phrase is uncertain. as well—the delights of a man’s heart. "
"18947","Ecclesiastes","2","9","I became greater by far than anyone in Jerusalem before me. In all this my wisdom stayed with me."
"18948","Ecclesiastes","2","10","I denied myself nothing my eyes desired;I refused my heart no pleasure.My heart took delight in all my labor,and this was the reward for all my toil."
"18949","Ecclesiastes","2","11","Yet when I surveyed all that my hands had doneand what I had toiled to achieve,everything was meaningless, a chasing after the wind;nothing was gained under the sun.Wisdom and Folly Are Meaningless"
"18950","Ecclesiastes","2","12","Then I turned my thoughts to consider wisdom,and also madness and folly.What more can the king’s successor dothan what has already been done?"
"18951","Ecclesiastes","2","13","I saw that wisdom is better than folly,just as light is better than darkness."
"18952","Ecclesiastes","2","14","The wise have eyes in their heads,while the fool walks in the darkness;but I came to realizethat the same fate overtakes them both."
"18953","Ecclesiastes","2","15","Then I said to myself,“The fate of the fool will overtake me also.What then do I gain by being wise?”I said to myself,“This too is meaningless.”"
"18954","Ecclesiastes","2","16","For the wise, like the fool, will not be long remembered;the days have already come when both have been forgotten.Like the fool, the wise too must die!Toil Is Meaningless"
"18955","Ecclesiastes","2","17","So I hated life, because the work that is done under the sun was grievous to me. All of it is meaningless, a chasing after the wind. "
"18956","Ecclesiastes","2","18","I hated all the things I had toiled for under the sun, because I must leave them to the one who comes after me. "
"18957","Ecclesiastes","2","19","And who knows whether that person will be wise or foolish? Yet they will have control over all the fruit of my toil into which I have poured my effort and skill under the sun. This too is meaningless. "
"18958","Ecclesiastes","2","20","So my heart began to despair over all my toilsome labor under the sun. "
"18959","Ecclesiastes","2","21","For a person may labor with wisdom, knowledge and skill, and then they must leave all they own to another who has not toiled for it. This too is meaningless and a great misfortune. "
"18960","Ecclesiastes","2","22","What do people get for all the toil and anxious striving with which they labor under the sun? "
"18961","Ecclesiastes","2","23","All their days their work is grief and pain; even at night their minds do not rest. This too is meaningless."
"18962","Ecclesiastes","2","24","A person can do nothing better than to eat and drink and find satisfaction in their own toil. This too, I see, is from the hand of God, "
"18963","Ecclesiastes","2","25","for without him, who can eat or find enjoyment? "
"18964","Ecclesiastes","2","26","To the person who pleases him, God gives wisdom, knowledge and happiness, but to the sinner he gives the task of gathering and storing up wealth to hand it over to the one who pleases God. This too is meaningless, a chasing after the wind."
"18965","Ecclesiastes","3","1","There is a time for everything,and a season for every activity under the heavens:"
"18966","Ecclesiastes","3","2","a time to be born and a time to die,a time to plant and a time to uproot,"
"18967","Ecclesiastes","3","3","a time to kill and a time to heal,a time to tear down and a time to build,"
"18968","Ecclesiastes","3","4","a time to weep and a time to laugh,a time to mourn and a time to dance,"
"18969","Ecclesiastes","3","5","a time to scatter stones and a time to gather them,a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing,"
"18970","Ecclesiastes","3","6","a time to search and a time to give up,a time to keep and a time to throw away,"
"18971","Ecclesiastes","3","7","a time to tear and a time to mend,a time to be silent and a time to speak,"
"18972","Ecclesiastes","3","8","a time to love and a time to hate,a time for war and a time for peace."
"18973","Ecclesiastes","3","9","What do workers gain from their toil? "
"18974","Ecclesiastes","3","10","I have seen the burden God has laid on the human race. "
"18975","Ecclesiastes","3","11","He has made everything beautiful in its time. He has also set eternity in the human heart; yet3:11 Or also placed ignorance in the human heart, so that no one can fathom what God has done from beginning to end. "
"18976","Ecclesiastes","3","12","I know that there is nothing better for people than to be happy and to do good while they live. "
"18977","Ecclesiastes","3","13","That each of them may eat and drink, and find satisfaction in all their toil—this is the gift of God. "
"18978","Ecclesiastes","3","14","I know that everything God does will endure forever; nothing can be added to it and nothing taken from it. God does it so that people will fear him."
"18979","Ecclesiastes","3","15","Whatever is has already been,and what will be has been before;and God will call the past to account.3:15 Or God calls back the past"
"18980","Ecclesiastes","3","16","And I saw something else under the sun:In the place of judgment—wickedness was there,in the place of justice—wickedness was there."
"18981","Ecclesiastes","3","17","I said to myself,“God will bring into judgmentboth the righteous and the wicked,for there will be a time for every activity,a time to judge every deed.”"
"18982","Ecclesiastes","3","18","I also said to myself, “As for humans, God tests them so that they may see that they are like the animals. "
"18983","Ecclesiastes","3","19","Surely the fate of human beings is like that of the animals; the same fate awaits them both: As one dies, so dies the other. All have the same breath3:19 Or spirit; humans have no advantage over animals. Everything is meaningless. "
"18984","Ecclesiastes","3","20","All go to the same place; all come from dust, and to dust all return. "
"18985","Ecclesiastes","3","21","Who knows if the human spirit rises upward and if the spirit of the animal goes down into the earth?”"
"18986","Ecclesiastes","3","22","So I saw that there is nothing better for a person than to enjoy their work, because that is their lot. For who can bring them to see what will happen after them?"
"18987","Ecclesiastes","4","1","Again I looked and saw all the oppression that was taking place under the sun:I saw the tears of the oppressed—and they have no comforter;power was on the side of their oppressors—and they have no comforter."
"18988","Ecclesiastes","4","2","And I declared that the dead,who had already died,are happier than the living,who are still alive."
"18989","Ecclesiastes","4","3","But better than bothis the one who has never been born,who has not seen the evilthat is done under the sun."
"18990","Ecclesiastes","4","4","And I saw that all toil and all achievement spring from one person’s envy of another. This too is meaningless, a chasing after the wind."
"18991","Ecclesiastes","4","5","Fools fold their handsand ruin themselves."
"18992","Ecclesiastes","4","6","Better one handful with tranquillitythan two handfuls with toiland chasing after the wind."
"18993","Ecclesiastes","4","7","Again I saw something meaningless under the sun:"
"18994","Ecclesiastes","4","8","There was a man all alone;he had neither son nor brother.There was no end to his toil,yet his eyes were not content with his wealth.“For whom am I toiling,” he asked,“and why am I depriving myself of enjoyment?”This too is meaningless—a miserable business!"
"18995","Ecclesiastes","4","9","Two are better than one,because they have a good return for their labor:"
"18996","Ecclesiastes","4","10","If either of them falls down,one can help the other up.But pity anyone who fallsand has no one to help them up."
"18997","Ecclesiastes","4","11","Also, if two lie down together, they will keep warm.But how can one keep warm alone?"
"18998","Ecclesiastes","4","12","Though one may be overpowered,two can defend themselves.A cord of three strands is not quickly broken.Advancement Is Meaningless"
"18999","Ecclesiastes","4","13","Better a poor but wise youth than an old but foolish king who no longer knows how to heed a warning. "
"19000","Ecclesiastes","4","14","The youth may have come from prison to the kingship, or he may have been born in poverty within his kingdom. "
"19001","Ecclesiastes","4","15","I saw that all who lived and walked under the sun followed the youth, the king’s successor. "
"19002","Ecclesiastes","4","16","There was no end to all the people who were before them. But those who came later were not pleased with the successor. This too is meaningless, a chasing after the wind."
"19003","Ecclesiastes","5","1","Guard your steps when you go to the house of God. Go near to listen rather than to offer the sacrifice of fools, who do not know that they do wrong."
"19004","Ecclesiastes","5","2","Do not be quick with your mouth,do not be hasty in your heartto utter anything before God.God is in heavenand you are on earth,so let your words be few."
"19005","Ecclesiastes","5","3","A dream comes when there are many cares,and many words mark the speech of a fool."
"19006","Ecclesiastes","5","4","When you make a vow to God, do not delay to fulfill it. He has no pleasure in fools; fulfill your vow. "
"19007","Ecclesiastes","5","5","It is better not to make a vow than to make one and not fulfill it. "
"19008","Ecclesiastes","5","6","Do not let your mouth lead you into sin. And do not protest to the temple messenger, “My vow was a mistake.” Why should God be angry at what you say and destroy the work of your hands? "
"19009","Ecclesiastes","5","7","Much dreaming and many words are meaningless. Therefore fear God.Riches Are Meaningless"
"19010","Ecclesiastes","5","8","If you see the poor oppressed in a district, and justice and rights denied, do not be surprised at such things; for one official is eyed by a higher one, and over them both are others higher still. "
"19011","Ecclesiastes","5","9","The increase from the land is taken by all; the king himself profits from the fields."
"19012","Ecclesiastes","5","10","Whoever loves money never has enough;whoever loves wealth is never satisfied with their income.This too is meaningless."
"19013","Ecclesiastes","5","11","As goods increase,so do those who consume them.And what benefit are they to the ownersexcept to feast their eyes on them?"
"19014","Ecclesiastes","5","12","The sleep of a laborer is sweet,whether they eat little or much,but as for the rich, their abundancepermits them no sleep."
"19015","Ecclesiastes","5","13","I have seen a grievous evil under the sun:wealth hoarded to the harm of its owners,"
"19016","Ecclesiastes","5","14","or wealth lost through some misfortune,so that when they have childrenthere is nothing left for them to inherit."
"19017","Ecclesiastes","5","15","Everyone comes naked from their mother’s womb,and as everyone comes, so they depart.They take nothing from their toilthat they can carry in their hands."
"19018","Ecclesiastes","5","16","This too is a grievous evil:As everyone comes, so they depart,and what do they gain,since they toil for the wind?"
"19019","Ecclesiastes","5","17","All their days they eat in darkness,with great frustration, affliction and anger."
"19020","Ecclesiastes","5","18","This is what I have observed to be good: that it is appropriate for a person to eat, to drink and to find satisfaction in their toilsome labor under the sun during the few days of life God has given them—for this is their lot. "
"19021","Ecclesiastes","5","19","Moreover, when God gives someone wealth and possessions, and the ability to enjoy them, to accept their lot and be happy in their toil—this is a gift of God. "
"19022","Ecclesiastes","5","20","They seldom reflect on the days of their life, because God keeps them occupied with gladness of heart."
"19023","Ecclesiastes","6","1","I have seen another evil under the sun, and it weighs heavily on mankind: "
"19024","Ecclesiastes","6","2","God gives some people wealth, possessions and honor, so that they lack nothing their hearts desire, but God does not grant them the ability to enjoy them, and strangers enjoy them instead. This is meaningless, a grievous evil."
"19025","Ecclesiastes","6","3","A man may have a hundred children and live many years; yet no matter how long he lives, if he cannot enjoy his prosperity and does not receive proper burial, I say that a stillborn child is better off than he. "
"19026","Ecclesiastes","6","4","It comes without meaning, it departs in darkness, and in darkness its name is shrouded. "
"19027","Ecclesiastes","6","5","Though it never saw the sun or knew anything, it has more rest than does that man— "
"19028","Ecclesiastes","6","6","even if he lives a thousand years twice over but fails to enjoy his prosperity. Do not all go to the same place?"
"19029","Ecclesiastes","6","7","Everyone’s toil is for their mouth,yet their appetite is never satisfied."
"19030","Ecclesiastes","6","8","What advantage have the wise over fools?What do the poor gainby knowing how to conduct themselves before others?"
"19031","Ecclesiastes","6","9","Better what the eye seesthan the roving of the appetite.This too is meaningless,a chasing after the wind."
"19032","Ecclesiastes","6","10","Whatever exists has already been named,and what humanity is has been known;no one can contendwith someone who is stronger."
"19033","Ecclesiastes","6","11","The more the words,the less the meaning,and how does that profit anyone?"
"19034","Ecclesiastes","6","12","For who knows what is good for a person in life, during the few and meaningless days they pass through like a shadow? Who can tell them what will happen under the sun after they are gone?"
"19035","Ecclesiastes","7","1","A good name is better than fine perfume,and the day of death better than the day of birth."
"19036","Ecclesiastes","7","2","It is better to go to a house of mourningthan to go to a house of feasting,for death is the destiny of everyone;the living should take this to heart."
"19037","Ecclesiastes","7","3","Frustration is better than laughter,because a sad face is good for the heart."
"19038","Ecclesiastes","7","4","The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning,but the heart of fools is in the house of pleasure."
"19039","Ecclesiastes","7","5","It is better to heed the rebuke of a wise personthan to listen to the song of fools."
"19040","Ecclesiastes","7","6","Like the crackling of thorns under the pot,so is the laughter of fools.This too is meaningless."
"19041","Ecclesiastes","7","7","Extortion turns a wise person into a fool,and a bribe corrupts the heart."
"19042","Ecclesiastes","7","8","The end of a matter is better than its beginning,and patience is better than pride."
"19043","Ecclesiastes","7","9","Do not be quickly provoked in your spirit,for anger resides in the lap of fools."
"19044","Ecclesiastes","7","10","Do not say, “Why were the old days better than these?”For it is not wise to ask such questions."
"19045","Ecclesiastes","7","11","Wisdom, like an inheritance, is a good thingand benefits those who see the sun."
"19046","Ecclesiastes","7","12","Wisdom is a shelteras money is a shelter,but the advantage of knowledge is this:Wisdom preserves those who have it."
"19047","Ecclesiastes","7","13","Consider what God has done:Who can straightenwhat he has made crooked?"
"19048","Ecclesiastes","7","14","When times are good, be happy;but when times are bad, consider this:God has made the oneas well as the other.Therefore, no one can discoveranything about their future."
"19049","Ecclesiastes","7","15","In this meaningless life of mine I have seen both of these:the righteous perishing in their righteousness,and the wicked living long in their wickedness."
"19050","Ecclesiastes","7","16","Do not be overrighteous,neither be overwise—why destroy yourself?"
"19051","Ecclesiastes","7","17","Do not be overwicked,and do not be a fool—why die before your time?"
"19052","Ecclesiastes","7","18","It is good to grasp the oneand not let go of the other.Whoever fears God will avoid all extremes.7:18 Or will follow them both"
"19053","Ecclesiastes","7","19","Wisdom makes one wise person more powerfulthan ten rulers in a city."
"19054","Ecclesiastes","7","20","Indeed, there is no one on earth who is righteous,no one who does what is right and never sins."
"19055","Ecclesiastes","7","21","Do not pay attention to every word people say,or you may hear your servant cursing you—"
"19056","Ecclesiastes","7","22","for you know in your heartthat many times you yourself have cursed others."
"19057","Ecclesiastes","7","23","All this I tested by wisdom and I said,“I am determined to be wise”—but this was beyond me."
"19058","Ecclesiastes","7","24","Whatever exists is far off and most profound—who can discover it?"
"19059","Ecclesiastes","7","25","So I turned my mind to understand,to investigate and to search out wisdom and the scheme of thingsand to understand the stupidity of wickednessand the madness of folly."
"19060","Ecclesiastes","7","26","I find more bitter than deaththe woman who is a snare,whose heart is a trapand whose hands are chains.The man who pleases God will escape her,but the sinner she will ensnare. "
"19061","Ecclesiastes","7","27","""Look,” says the Teacher,7:27 Or the leader of the assembly “this is what I have discovered:“Adding one thing to another to discover the scheme of things—"
"19062","Ecclesiastes","7","28","while I was still searchingbut not finding—I found one upright man among a thousand,but not one upright woman among them all."
"19063","Ecclesiastes","7","29","This only have I found:God created mankind upright,but they have gone in search of many schemes.”"
"19064","Ecclesiastes","8","1","Who is like the wise?Who knows the explanation of things?A person’s wisdom brightens their faceand changes its hard appearance.Obey the King"
"19065","Ecclesiastes","8","2","Obey the king’s command, I say, because you took an oath before God. "
"19066","Ecclesiastes","8","3","Do not be in a hurry to leave the king’s presence. Do not stand up for a bad cause, for he will do whatever he pleases. "
"19067","Ecclesiastes","8","4","Since a king’s word is supreme, who can say to him, “What are you doing?”"
"19068","Ecclesiastes","8","5","Whoever obeys his command will come to no harm,and the wise heart will know the proper time and procedure."
"19069","Ecclesiastes","8","6","For there is a proper time and procedure for every matter,though a person may be weighed down by misery."
"19070","Ecclesiastes","8","7","Since no one knows the future,who can tell someone else what is to come?"
"19071","Ecclesiastes","8","8","As no one has power over the wind to contain it,so8:8 Or over the human spirit to retain it, / and so no one has power over the time of their death.As no one is discharged in time of war,so wickedness will not release those who practice it."
"19072","Ecclesiastes","8","9","All this I saw, as I applied my mind to everything done under the sun. There is a time when a man lords it over others to his own8:9 Or to their hurt. "
"19073","Ecclesiastes","8","10","Then too, I saw the wicked buried—those who used to come and go from the holy place and receive praise8:10 Some Hebrew manuscripts and Septuagint (Aquila); most Hebrew manuscripts and are forgotten in the city where they did this. This too is meaningless."
"19074","Ecclesiastes","8","11","When the sentence for a crime is not quickly carried out, people’s hearts are filled with schemes to do wrong. "
"19075","Ecclesiastes","8","12","Although a wicked person who commits a hundred crimes may live a long time, I know that it will go better with those who fear God, who are reverent before him. "
"19076","Ecclesiastes","8","13","Yet because the wicked do not fear God, it will not go well with them, and their days will not lengthen like a shadow."
"19077","Ecclesiastes","8","14","There is something else meaningless that occurs on earth: the righteous who get what the wicked deserve, and the wicked who get what the righteous deserve. This too, I say, is meaningless. "
"19078","Ecclesiastes","8","15","So I commend the enjoyment of life, because there is nothing better for a person under the sun than to eat and drink and be glad. Then joy will accompany them in their toil all the days of the life God has given them under the sun."
"19079","Ecclesiastes","8","16","When I applied my mind to know wisdom and to observe the labor that is done on earth—people getting no sleep day or night— "
"19080","Ecclesiastes","8","17","then I saw all that God has done. No one can comprehend what goes on under the sun. Despite all their efforts to search it out, no one can discover its meaning. Even if the wise claim they know, they cannot really comprehend it."
"19081","Ecclesiastes","9","1","So I reflected on all this and concluded that the righteous and the wise and what they do are in God’s hands, but no one knows whether love or hate awaits them. "
"19082","Ecclesiastes","9","2","All share a common destiny—the righteous and the wicked, the good and the bad,9:2 Septuagint (Aquila), Vulgate and Syriac; Hebrew does not have and the bad. the clean and the unclean, those who offer sacrifices and those who do not.As it is with the good,so with the sinful;as it is with those who take oaths,so with those who are afraid to take them."
"19083","Ecclesiastes","9","3","This is the evil in everything that happens under the sun: The same destiny overtakes all. The hearts of people, moreover, are full of evil and there is madness in their hearts while they live, and afterward they join the dead. "
"19084","Ecclesiastes","9","4","Anyone who is among the living has hope9:4 Or What then is to be chosen? With all who live, there is hope—even a live dog is better off than a dead lion!"
"19085","Ecclesiastes","9","5","For the living know that they will die,but the dead know nothing;they have no further reward,and even their name is forgotten."
"19086","Ecclesiastes","9","6","Their love, their hateand their jealousy have long since vanished;never again will they have a partin anything that happens under the sun."
"19087","Ecclesiastes","9","7","Go, eat your food with gladness, and drink your wine with a joyful heart, for God has already approved what you do. "
"19088","Ecclesiastes","9","8","Always be clothed in white, and always anoint your head with oil. "
"19089","Ecclesiastes","9","9","Enjoy life with your wife, whom you love, all the days of this meaningless life that God has given you under the sun—all your meaningless days. For this is your lot in life and in your toilsome labor under the sun. "
"19090","Ecclesiastes","9","10","Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with all your might, for in the realm of the dead, where you are going, there is neither working nor planning nor knowledge nor wisdom."
"19091","Ecclesiastes","9","11","I have seen something else under the sun:The race is not to the swiftor the battle to the strong,nor does food come to the wiseor wealth to the brilliantor favor to the learned;but time and chance happen to them all."
"19092","Ecclesiastes","9","12","Moreover, no one knows when their hour will come:As fish are caught in a cruel net,or birds are taken in a snare,so people are trapped by evil timesthat fall unexpectedly upon them.Wisdom Better Than Folly"
"19093","Ecclesiastes","9","13","I also saw under the sun this example of wisdom that greatly impressed me: "
"19094","Ecclesiastes","9","14","There was once a small city with only a few people in it. And a powerful king came against it, surrounded it and built huge siege works against it. "
"19095","Ecclesiastes","9","15","Now there lived in that city a man poor but wise, and he saved the city by his wisdom. But nobody remembered that poor man. "
"19096","Ecclesiastes","9","16","So I said, “Wisdom is better than strength.” But the poor man’s wisdom is despised, and his words are no longer heeded."
"19097","Ecclesiastes","9","17","The quiet words of the wise are more to be heededthan the shouts of a ruler of fools."
"19098","Ecclesiastes","9","18","Wisdom is better than weapons of war,but one sinner destroys much good."
"19099","Ecclesiastes","10","1","As dead flies give perfume a bad smell,so a little folly outweighs wisdom and honor."
"19100","Ecclesiastes","10","2","The heart of the wise inclines to the right,but the heart of the fool to the left."
"19101","Ecclesiastes","10","3","Even as fools walk along the road,they lack senseand show everyone how stupid they are."
"19102","Ecclesiastes","10","4","If a ruler’s anger rises against you,do not leave your post;calmness can lay great offenses to rest."
"19103","Ecclesiastes","10","5","There is an evil I have seen under the sun,the sort of error that arises from a ruler:"
"19104","Ecclesiastes","10","6","Fools are put in many high positions,while the rich occupy the low ones."
"19105","Ecclesiastes","10","7","I have seen slaves on horseback,while princes go on foot like slaves."
"19106","Ecclesiastes","10","8","Whoever digs a pit may fall into it;whoever breaks through a wall may be bitten by a snake."
"19107","Ecclesiastes","10","9","Whoever quarries stones may be injured by them;whoever splits logs may be endangered by them."
"19108","Ecclesiastes","10","10","If the ax is dulland its edge unsharpened,more strength is needed,but skill will bring success."
"19109","Ecclesiastes","10","11","If a snake bites before it is charmed,the charmer receives no fee."
"19110","Ecclesiastes","10","12","Words from the mouth of the wise are gracious,but fools are consumed by their own lips."
"19111","Ecclesiastes","10","13","At the beginning their words are folly;at the end they are wicked madness—"
"19112","Ecclesiastes","10","14","and fools multiply words.No one knows what is coming—who can tell someone else what will happen after them?"
"19113","Ecclesiastes","10","15","The toil of fools wearies them;they do not know the way to town."
"19114","Ecclesiastes","10","16","Woe to the land whose king was a servant10:16 Or king is a childand whose princes feast in the morning."
"19115","Ecclesiastes","10","17","Blessed is the land whose king is of noble birthand whose princes eat at a proper time—for strength and not for drunkenness."
"19116","Ecclesiastes","10","18","Through laziness, the rafters sag;because of idle hands, the house leaks."
"19117","Ecclesiastes","10","19","A feast is made for laughter,wine makes life merry,and money is the answer for everything."
"19118","Ecclesiastes","10","20","Do not revile the king even in your thoughts,or curse the rich in your bedroom,because a bird in the sky may carry your words,and a bird on the wing may report what you say."
"19119","Ecclesiastes","11","1","Ship your grain across the sea;after many days you may receive a return."
"19120","Ecclesiastes","11","2","Invest in seven ventures, yes, in eight;you do not know what disaster may come upon the land."

"20737","Jeremiah","20","18","Why did I ever come out of the wombto see trouble and sorrowand to end my days in shame?"
"20738","Jeremiah","21","1","The word came to Jeremiah from the Lord when King Zedekiah sent to him Pashhur son of Malkijah and the priest Zephaniah son of Maaseiah. They said:  "
"20739","Jeremiah","21","2","""Inquire now of the Lord for us because Nebuchadnezzar21:2 Hebrew Nebuchadrezzar, of which Nebuchadnezzar is a variant; here and often in Jeremiah and Ezekiel king of Babylon is attacking us. Perhaps the Lord will perform wonders for us as in times past so that he will withdraw from us.”"
"20740","Jeremiah","21","3","But Jeremiah answered them, “Tell Zedekiah, 4‘This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: I am about to turn against you the weapons of war that are in your hands, which you are using to fight the king of Babylon and the Babylonians21:4 Or Chaldeans; also in verse 9 who are outside the wall besieging you. And I will gather them inside this city. "
"20741","Jeremiah","21","5","I myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and a mighty arm in furious anger and in great wrath. "
"20742","Jeremiah","21","6","I will strike down those who live in this city—both man and beast—and they will die of a terrible plague. "
"20743","Jeremiah","21","7","After that, declares the Lord, I will give Zedekiah king of Judah, his officials and the people in this city who survive the plague, sword and famine, into the hands of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and to their enemies who want to kill them. He will put them to the sword; he will show them no mercy or pity or compassion.’ "
"20744","Jeremiah","21","8","""Furthermore, tell the people, ‘This is what the Lord says: See, I am setting before you the way of life and the way of death. "
"20745","Jeremiah","21","9","Whoever stays in this city will die by the sword, famine or plague. But whoever goes out and surrenders to the Babylonians who are besieging you will live; they will escape with their lives. "
"20746","Jeremiah","21","10","I have determined to do this city harm and not good, declares the Lord. It will be given into the hands of the king of Babylon, and he will destroy it with fire.’ "
"20747","Jeremiah","21","11","""Moreover, say to the royal house of Judah, ‘Hear the word of the Lord. "

"20750","Jeremiah","21","14","I will punish you as your deeds deserve,declares the Lord.I will kindle a fire in your foreststhat will consume everything around you.’ ”"
"20751","Jeremiah","22","1","This is what the Lord says: “Go down to the palace of the king of Judah and proclaim this message there: 2‘Hear the word of the Lord to you, king of Judah, you who sit on David’s throne—you, your officials and your people who come through these gates. "
"20752","Jeremiah","22","3","This is what the Lord says: Do what is just and right. Rescue from the hand of the oppressor the one who has been robbed. Do no wrong or violence to the foreigner, the fatherless or the widow, and do not shed innocent blood in this place. "
"20753","Jeremiah","22","4","For if you are careful to carry out these commands, then kings who sit on David’s throne will come through the gates of this palace, riding in chariots and on horses, accompanied by their officials and their people. "
"20754","Jeremiah","22","5","But if you do not obey these commands, declares the Lord, I swear by myself that this palace will become a ruin.’ ”"
"20755","Jeremiah","22","6","For this is what the Lord says about the palace of the king of Judah:“Though you are like Gilead to me,like the summit of Lebanon,I will surely make you like a wasteland,like towns not inhabited."
"20756","Jeremiah","22","7","I will send destroyers against you,each man with his weapons,and they will cut up your fine cedar beamsand throw them into the fire. "

"20759","Jeremiah","22","10","Do not weep for the dead king or mourn his loss;rather, weep bitterly for him who is exiled,because he will never returnnor see his native land again."
"20760","Jeremiah","22","11","For this is what the Lord says about Shallum22:11 Also called Jehoahaz son of Josiah, who succeeded his father as king of Judah but has gone from this place: “He will never return. "

"20763","Jeremiah","22","14","He says, ‘I will build myself a great palacewith spacious upper rooms.’So he makes large windows in it,panels it with cedarand decorates it in red. "
"20764","Jeremiah","22","15","""Does it make you a kingto have more and more cedar?Did not your father have food and drink?He did what was right and just,so all went well with him."
"20765","Jeremiah","22","16","He defended the cause of the poor and needy,and so all went well.Is that not what it means to know me?”declares the Lord. "
"20766","Jeremiah","22","17","""But your eyes and your heartare set only on dishonest gain,on shedding innocent bloodand on oppression and extortion.”"
"20767","Jeremiah","22","18","Therefore this is what the Lord says about Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah:“They will not mourn for him:‘Alas, my brother! Alas, my sister!’They will not mourn for him:‘Alas, my master! Alas, his splendor!’"
"20768","Jeremiah","22","19","He will have the burial of a donkey—dragged away and thrownoutside the gates of Jerusalem.” "

"20771","Jeremiah","22","22","The wind will drive all your shepherds away,and your allies will go into exile.Then you will be ashamed and disgracedbecause of all your wickedness."
"20772","Jeremiah","22","23","You who live in ‘Lebanon,22:23 That is, the palace in Jerusalem (see 1 Kings 7:2)’who are nestled in cedar buildings,how you will groan when pangs come upon you,pain like that of a woman in labor! "
"20773","Jeremiah","22","24","""As surely as I live,” declares the Lord, “even if you, Jehoiachin22:24 Hebrew Koniah, a variant of Jehoiachin; also in verse 28 son of Jehoiakim king of Judah, were a signet ring on my right hand, I would still pull you off. "

"20786","Jeremiah","23","27","They think the dreams they tell one another will make my people forget my name, just as their ancestors forgot my name through Baal worship. "
"20787","Jeremiah","23","28","Let the prophet who has a dream recount the dream, but let the one who has my word speak it faithfully. For what has straw to do with grain?” declares the Lord.  "

"20793","Jeremiah","23","34","If a prophet or a priest or anyone else claims, ‘This is a message from the Lord,’ I will punish them and their household. "
"20794","Jeremiah","23","35","This is what each of you keeps saying to your friends and other Israelites: ‘What is the Lord’s answer?’ or ‘What has the Lord spoken?’ "
"20795","Jeremiah","23","36","But you must not mention ‘a message from the Lord’ again, because each one’s word becomes their own message. So you distort the words of the living God, the Lord Almighty, our God. "
"20796","Jeremiah","23","37","This is what you keep saying to a prophet: ‘What is the Lord’s answer to you?’ or ‘What has the Lord spoken?’ "

"20800","Jeremiah","24","1","After Jehoiachin24:1 Hebrew Jeconiah, a variant of Jehoiachin son of Jehoiakim king of Judah and the officials, the skilled workers and the artisans of Judah were carried into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon by Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, the Lord showed me two baskets of figs placed in front of the temple of the Lord. "
"20801","Jeremiah","24","2","One basket had very good figs, like those that ripen early; the other basket had very bad figs, so bad they could not be eaten."
"20802","Jeremiah","24","3","Then the Lord asked me, “What do you see, Jeremiah?”“Figs,” I answered. “The good ones are very good, but the bad ones are so bad they cannot be eaten.”"
"20803","Jeremiah","24","4","Then the word of the Lord came to me:  "
"20804","Jeremiah","24","5","""This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: ‘Like these good figs, I regard as good the exiles from Judah, whom I sent away from this place to the land of the Babylonians.24:5 Or Chaldeans "

"20806","Jeremiah","24","7","I will give them a heart to know me, that I am the Lord. They will be my people, and I will be their God, for they will return to me with all their heart. "
"20807","Jeremiah","24","8",""" ‘But like the bad figs, which are so bad they cannot be eaten,’ says the Lord, ‘so will I deal with Zedekiah king of Judah, his officials and the survivors from Jerusalem, whether they remain in this land or live in Egypt. "
"20808","Jeremiah","24","9","I will make them abhorrent and an offense to all the kingdoms of the earth, a reproach and a byword, a curse24:9 That is, their names will be used in cursing (see 29:22); or, others will see that they are cursed. and an object of ridicule, wherever I banish them. "
"20809","Jeremiah","24","10","I will send the sword, famine and plague against them until they are destroyed from the land I gave to them and their ancestors.’ ”"
"20810","Jeremiah","25","1","The word came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah in the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, which was the first year of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon. "
"20811","Jeremiah","25","2","So Jeremiah the prophet said to all the people of Judah and to all those living in Jerusalem: "
"20812","Jeremiah","25","3","For twenty-three years—from the thirteenth year of Josiah son of Amon king of Judah until this very day—the word of the Lord has come to me and I have spoken to you again and again, but you have not listened."
"20813","Jeremiah","25","4","And though the Lord has sent all his servants the prophets to you again and again, you have not listened or paid any attention. "
"20814","Jeremiah","25","5","They said, “Turn now, each of you, from your evil ways and your evil practices, and you can stay in the land the Lord gave to you and your ancestors for ever and ever. "
"20815","Jeremiah","25","6","Do not follow other gods to serve and worship them; do not arouse my anger with what your hands have made. Then I will not harm you.” "
"20816","Jeremiah","25","7","""But you did not listen to me,” declares the Lord, “and you have aroused my anger with what your hands have made, and you have brought harm to yourselves.”"
"20817","Jeremiah","25","8","Therefore the Lord Almighty says this: “Because you have not listened to my words, "
"20818","Jeremiah","25","9","I will summon all the peoples of the north and my servant Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon,” declares the Lord, “and I will bring them against this land and its inhabitants and against all the surrounding nations.

"
"20819","Jeremiah","25","10","I will banish from them the sounds of joy and gladness, the voices of bride and bridegroom, the sound of millstones and the light of the lamp. "
"20820","Jeremiah","25","11","This whole country will become a desolate wasteland, and these nations will serve the king of Babylon seventy years. "
"20821","Jeremiah","25","12","""But when the seventy years are fulfilled, I will punish the king of Babylon and his nation, the land of the Babylonians,25:12 Or Chaldeans for their guilt,” declares the Lord, “and will make it desolate forever. "

"20823","Jeremiah","25","14","They themselves will be enslaved by many nations and great kings; I will repay them according to their deeds and the work of their hands.”The Cup of God’s Wrath"
"20824","Jeremiah","25","15","This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, said to me: “Take from my hand this cup filled with the wine of my wrath and make all the nations to whom I send you drink it. "
"20825","Jeremiah","25","16","When they drink it, they will stagger and go mad because of the sword I will send among them.”"
"20826","Jeremiah","25","17","So I took the cup from the Lord’s hand and made all the nations to whom he sent me drink it: "

"20881","Jeremiah","27","11","But if any nation will bow its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon and serve him, I will let that nation remain in its own land to till it and to live there, declares the Lord.” ’ ”"
"20882","Jeremiah","27","12","I gave the same message to Zedekiah king of Judah. I said, “Bow your neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon; serve him and his people, and you will live. "
"20883","Jeremiah","27","13","Why will you and your people die by the sword, famine and plague with which the Lord has threatened any nation that will not serve the king of Babylon? "
"20884","Jeremiah","27","14","Do not listen to the words of the prophets who say to you, ‘You will not serve the king of Babylon,’ for they are prophesying lies to you. 15‘I have not sent them,’ declares the Lord. ‘They are prophesying lies in my name. Therefore, I will banish you and you will perish, both you and the prophets who prophesy to you.’ ”"
"20885","Jeremiah","27","16","Then I said to the priests and all these people, “This is what the Lord says: Do not listen to the prophets who say, ‘Very soon now the articles from the Lord’s house will be brought back from Babylon.’ They are prophesying lies to you. "
"20886","Jeremiah","27","17","Do not listen to them. Serve the king of Babylon, and you will live. Why should this city become a ruin? "
"20887","Jeremiah","27","18","If they are prophets and have the word of the Lord, let them plead with the Lord Almighty that the articles remaining in the house of the Lord and in the palace of the king of Judah and in Jerusalem not be taken to Babylon. "
"20888","Jeremiah","27","19","For this is what the Lord Almighty says about the pillars, the bronze Sea, the movable stands and the other articles that are left in this city, "
"20889","Jeremiah","27","20","which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon did not take away when he carried Jehoiachin27:20 Hebrew Jeconiah, a variant of Jehoiachin son of Jehoiakim king of Judah into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon, along with all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem— "
"20890","Jeremiah","27","21","yes, this is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says about the things that are left in the house of the Lord and in the palace of the king of Judah and in Jerusalem: 22‘They will be taken to Babylon and there they will remain until the day I come for them,’ declares the Lord. ‘Then I will bring them back and restore them to this place.’ ”"
"20891","Jeremiah","28","1","In the fifth month of that same year, the fourth year, early in the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, the prophet Hananiah son of Azzur, who was from Gibeon, said to me in the house of the Lord in the presence of the priests and all the people:  "
"20892","Jeremiah","28","2","""This is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says: ‘I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon. "
"20893","Jeremiah","28","3","Within two years I will bring back to this place all the articles of the Lord’s house that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon removed from here and took to Babylon. "
"20894","Jeremiah","28","4","I will also bring back to this place Jehoiachin28:4 Hebrew Jeconiah, a variant of Jehoiachin son of Jehoiakim king of Judah and all the other exiles from Judah who went to Babylon,’ declares the Lord, ‘for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon.’ ”"
"20895","Jeremiah","28","5","Then the prophet Jeremiah replied to the prophet Hananiah before the priests and all the people who were standing in the house of the Lord. "
"20896","Jeremiah","28","6","He said, “Amen! May the Lord do so! May the Lord fulfill the words you have prophesied by bringing the articles of the Lord’s house and all the exiles back to this place from Babylon. "
"20897","Jeremiah","28","7","Nevertheless, listen to what I have to say in your hearing and in the hearing of all the people: "
"20898","Jeremiah","28","8","From early times the prophets who preceded you and me have prophesied war, disaster and plague against many countries and great kingdoms. "
"20899","Jeremiah","28","9","But the prophet who prophesies peace will be recognized as one truly sent by the Lord only if his prediction comes true.”"
"20900","Jeremiah","28","10","Then the prophet Hananiah took the yoke off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah and broke it, "
"20901","Jeremiah","28","11","and he said before all the people, “This is what the Lord says: ‘In the same way I will break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon off the neck of all the nations within two years.’ ” At this, the prophet Jeremiah went on his way."
"20902","Jeremiah","28","12","After the prophet Hananiah had broken the yoke off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah, the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah:  "
"20903","Jeremiah","28","13","""Go and tell Hananiah, ‘This is what the Lord says: You have broken a wooden yoke, but in its place you will get a yoke of iron. "

"20905","Jeremiah","28","15","Then the prophet Jeremiah said to Hananiah the prophet, “Listen, Hananiah! The Lord has not sent you, yet you have persuaded this nation to trust in lies. "
"20906","Jeremiah","28","16","Therefore this is what the Lord says: ‘I am about to remove you from the face of the earth. This very year you are going to die, because you have preached rebellion against the Lord.’ ”"
"20907","Jeremiah","28","17","In the seventh month of that same year, Hananiah the prophet died."
"20908","Jeremiah","29","1","This is the text of the letter that the prophet Jeremiah sent from Jerusalem to the surviving elders among the exiles and to the priests, the prophets and all the other people Nebuchadnezzar had carried into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon. 2(This was after King Jehoiachin29:2 Hebrew Jeconiah, a variant of Jehoiachin and the queen mother, the court officials and the leaders of Judah and Jerusalem, the skilled workers and the artisans had gone into exile from Jerusalem.) "
"20909","Jeremiah","29","3","He entrusted the letter to Elasah son of Shaphan and to Gemariah son of Hilkiah, whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent to King Nebuchadnezzar in Babylon. It said:"

"20918","Jeremiah","29","12","Then you will call on me and come and pray to me, and I will listen to you. "

"20921","Jeremiah","29","15","You may say, “The Lord has raised up prophets for us in Babylon,” "

"20923","Jeremiah","29","17","yes, this is what the Lord Almighty says: “I will send the sword, famine and plague against them and I will make them like figs that are so bad they cannot be eaten. "
"20924","Jeremiah","29","18","I will pursue them with the sword, famine and plague and will make them abhorrent to all the kingdoms of the earth, a curse29:18 That is, their names will be used in cursing (see verse 22); or, others will see that they are cursed. and an object of horror, of scorn and reproach, among all the nations where I drive them.

"20928","Jeremiah","29","22","Because of them, all the exiles from Judah who are in Babylon will use this curse: ‘May the Lord treat you like Zedekiah and Ahab, whom the king of Babylon burned in the fire.’ "

"21027","Jeremiah","32","37","I will surely gather them from all the lands where I banish them in my furious anger and great wrath; I will bring them back to this place and let them live in safety. "
"21028","Jeremiah","32","38","They will be my people, and I will be their God. "
"21029","Jeremiah","32","39","I will give them singleness of heart and action, so that they will always fear me and that all will then go well for them and for their children after them. "
"21030","Jeremiah","32","40","I will make an everlasting covenant with them: I will never stop doing good to them, and I will inspire them to fear me, so that they will never turn away from me. "
"21031","Jeremiah","32","41","I will rejoice in doing them good and will assuredly plant them in this land with all my heart and soul. "
"21032","Jeremiah","32","42","""This is what the Lord says: As I have brought all this great calamity on this people, so I will give them all the prosperity I have promised them. "

"21034","Jeremiah","32","44","Fields will be bought for silver, and deeds will be signed, sealed and witnessed in the territory of Benjamin, in the villages around Jerusalem, in the towns of Judah and in the towns of the hill country, of the western foothills and of the Negev, because I will restore their fortunes,32:44 Or will bring them back from captivity declares the Lord.”"
"21035","Jeremiah","33","1","While Jeremiah was still confined in the courtyard of the guard, the word of the Lord came to him a second time:  "
"21036","Jeremiah","33","2","""This is what the Lord says, he who made the earth, the Lord who formed it and established it—the Lord is his name: 3‘Call to me and I will answer you and tell you great and unsearchable things you do not know.’ "
"21037","Jeremiah","33","4","For this is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says about the houses in this city and the royal palaces of Judah that have been torn down to be used against the siege ramps and the sword "
"21038","Jeremiah","33","5","in the fight with the Babylonians33:5 Or Chaldeans: ‘They will be filled with the dead bodies of the people I will slay in my anger and wrath. I will hide my face from this city because of all its wickedness. "
"21039","Jeremiah","33","6",""" ‘Nevertheless, I will bring health and healing to it; I will heal my people and will let them enjoy abundant peace and security. "

"21041","Jeremiah","33","8","I will cleanse them from all the sin they have committed against me and will forgive all their sins of rebellion against me. "
"21042","Jeremiah","33","9","Then this city will bring me renown, joy, praise and honor before all nations on earth that hear of all the good things I do for it; and they will be in awe and will tremble at the abundant prosperity and peace I provide for it.’ "
"21043","Jeremiah","33","10","""This is what the Lord says: ‘You say about this place, “It is a desolate waste, without people or animals.” Yet in the towns of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem that are deserted, inhabited by neither people nor animals, there will be heard once more "

"21045","Jeremiah","33","12","""This is what the Lord Almighty says: ‘In this place, desolate and without people or animals—in all its towns there will again be pastures for shepherds to rest their flocks. "

"21050","Jeremiah","33","17","For this is what the Lord says: ‘David will never fail to have a man to sit on the throne of Israel, "

"21052","Jeremiah","33","19","The word of the Lord came to Jeremiah:  "
"21053","Jeremiah","33","20","""This is what the Lord says: ‘If you can break my covenant with the day and my covenant with the night, so that day and night no longer come at their appointed time, "
"21054","Jeremiah","33","21","then my covenant with David my servant—and my covenant with the Levites who are priests ministering before me—can be broken and David will no longer have a descendant to reign on his throne. "
"21055","Jeremiah","33","22","I will make the descendants of David my servant and the Levites who minister before me as countless as the stars in the sky and as measureless as the sand on the seashore.’ ”"
"21056","Jeremiah","33","23","The word of the Lord came to Jeremiah:  "
"21057","Jeremiah","33","24","""Have you not noticed that these people are saying, ‘The Lord has rejected the two kingdoms33:24 Or families he chose’? So they despise my people and no longer regard them as a nation. "
"21058","Jeremiah","33","25","This is what the Lord says: ‘If I have not made my covenant with day and night and established the laws of heaven and earth, "
"21059","Jeremiah","33","26","then I will reject the descendants of Jacob and David my servant and will not choose one of his sons to rule over the descendants of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. For I will restore their fortunes33:26 Or will bring them back from captivity and have compassion on them.’ ”"
"21060","Jeremiah","34","1","While Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and all his army and all the kingdoms and peoples in the empire he ruled were fighting against Jerusalem and all its surrounding towns, this word came to Jeremiah from the Lord:  "
"21061","Jeremiah","34","2","""This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: Go to Zedekiah king of Judah and tell him, ‘This is what the Lord says: I am about to give this city into the hands of the king of Babylon, and he will burn it down. "

"21065","Jeremiah","34","6","Then Jeremiah the prophet told all this to Zedekiah king of Judah, in Jerusalem, "
"21066","Jeremiah","34","7","while the army of the king of Babylon was fighting against Jerusalem and the other cities of Judah that were still holding out—Lachish and Azekah. These were the only fortified cities left in Judah.Freedom for Slaves"
"21067","Jeremiah","34","8","The word came to Jeremiah from the Lord after King Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people in Jerusalem to proclaim freedom for the slaves. "
"21068","Jeremiah","34","9","Everyone was to free their Hebrew slaves, both male and female; no one was to hold a fellow Hebrew in bondage. "
"21069","Jeremiah","34","10","So all the officials and people who entered into this covenant agreed that they would free their male and female slaves and no longer hold them in bondage. They agreed, and set them free. "
"21070","Jeremiah","34","11","But afterward they changed their minds and took back the slaves they had freed and enslaved them again."
"21071","Jeremiah","34","12","Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah:  "
"21072","Jeremiah","34","13","""This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: I made a covenant with your ancestors when I brought them out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery. I said, 14‘Every seventh year each of you must free any fellow Hebrews who have sold themselves to you. After they have served you six years, you must let them go free.’34:14 Deut. 15:12 Your ancestors, however, did not listen to me or pay attention to me. "
"21073","Jeremiah","34","15","Recently you repented and did what is right in my sight: Each of you proclaimed freedom to your own people. You even made a covenant before me in the house that bears my Name. "
"21074","Jeremiah","34","16","But now you have turned around and profaned my name; each of you has taken back the male and female slaves you had set free to go where they wished. You have forced them to become your slaves again. "
"21075","Jeremiah","34","17","""Therefore this is what the Lord says: You have not obeyed me; you have not proclaimed freedom to your own people. So I now proclaim ‘freedom’ for you, declares the Lord—‘freedom’ to fall by the sword, plague and famine. I will make you abhorrent to all the kingdoms of the earth. "
"21076","Jeremiah","34","18","Those who have violated my covenant and have not fulfilled the terms of the covenant they made before me, I will treat like the calf they cut in two and then walked between its pieces. "
"21077","Jeremiah","34","19","The leaders of Judah and Jerusalem, the court officials, the priests and all the people of the land who walked between the pieces of the calf, "
"21078","Jeremiah","34","20","I will deliver into the hands of their enemies who want to kill them. Their dead bodies will become food for the birds and the wild animals. "
"21079","Jeremiah","34","21","""I will deliver Zedekiah king of Judah and his officials into the hands of their enemies who want to kill them, to the army of the king of Babylon, which has withdrawn from you. "
"21080","Jeremiah","34","22","I am going to give the order, declares the Lord, and I will bring them back to this city. They will fight against it, take it and burn it down. And I will lay waste the towns of Judah so no one can live there.”"
"21081","Jeremiah","35","1","This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord during the reign of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah:  "
"21082","Jeremiah","35","2","""Go to the Rekabite family and invite them to come to one of the side rooms of the house of the Lord and give them wine to drink.”"
"21083","Jeremiah","35","3","So I went to get Jaazaniah son of Jeremiah, the son of Habazziniah, and his brothers and all his sons—the whole family of the Rekabites. "
"21084","Jeremiah","35","4","I brought them into the house of the Lord, into the room of the sons of Hanan son of Igdaliah the man of God. It was next to the room of the officials, which was over that of Maaseiah son of Shallum the doorkeeper. "
"21085","Jeremiah","35","5","Then I set bowls full of wine and some cups before the Rekabites and said to them, “Drink some wine.”"
"21086","Jeremiah","35","6","But they replied, “We do not drink wine, because our forefather Jehonadab35:6 Hebrew Jonadab, a variant of Jehonadab; here and often in this chapter son of Rekab gave us this command: ‘Neither you nor your descendants must ever drink wine. "
"21087","Jeremiah","35","7","Also you must never build houses, sow seed or plant vineyards; you must never have any of these things, but must always live in tents. Then you will live a long time in the land where you are nomads.’ "
"21088","Jeremiah","35","8","We have obeyed everything our forefather Jehonadab son of Rekab commanded us. Neither we nor our wives nor our sons and daughters have ever drunk wine "
"21089","Jeremiah","35","9","or built houses to live in or had vineyards, fields or crops. "
"21090","Jeremiah","35","10","We have lived in tents and have fully obeyed everything our forefather Jehonadab commanded us. "
"21091","Jeremiah","35","11","But when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon invaded this land, we said, ‘Come, we must go to Jerusalem to escape the Babylonian35:11 Or Chaldean and Aramean armies.’ So we have remained in Jerusalem.”"
"21092","Jeremiah","35","12","Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah, saying:  "
"21093","Jeremiah","35","13","""This is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says: Go and tell the people of Judah and those living in Jerusalem, ‘Will you not learn a lesson and obey my words?’ declares the Lord. 14‘Jehonadab son of Rekab ordered his descendants not to drink wine and this command has been kept. To this day they do not drink wine, because they obey their forefather’s command. But I have spoken to you again and again, yet you have not obeyed me. "
"21094","Jeremiah","35","15","Again and again I sent all my servants the prophets to you. They said, “Each of you must turn from your wicked ways and reform your actions; do not follow other gods to serve them. Then you will live in the land I have given to you and your ancestors.” But you have not paid attention or listened to me. "
"21095","Jeremiah","35","16","The descendants of Jehonadab son of Rekab have carried out the command their forefather gave them, but these people have not obeyed me.’ "
"21096","Jeremiah","35","17","""Therefore this is what the Lord God Almighty, the God of Israel, says: ‘Listen! I am going to bring on Judah and on everyone living in Jerusalem every disaster I pronounced against them. I spoke to them, but they did not listen; I called to them, but they did not answer.’ ”"
"21097","Jeremiah","35","18","Then Jeremiah said to the family of the Rekabites, “This is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says: ‘You have obeyed the command of your forefather Jehonadab and have followed all his instructions and have done everything he ordered.’ "
"21098","Jeremiah","35","19","Therefore this is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says: ‘Jehonadab son of Rekab will never fail to have a descendant to serve me.’ ”"
"21099","Jeremiah","36","1","In the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, this word came to Jeremiah from the Lord:  "
"21100","Jeremiah","36","2","""Take a scroll and write on it all the words I have spoken to you concerning Israel, Judah and all the other nations from the time I began speaking to you in the reign of Josiah till now. "
"21101","Jeremiah","36","3","Perhaps when the people of Judah hear about every disaster I plan to inflict on them, they will each turn from their wicked ways; then I will forgive their wickedness and their sin.”"
"21102","Jeremiah","36","4","So Jeremiah called Baruch son of Neriah, and while Jeremiah dictated all the words the Lord had spoken to him, Baruch wrote them on the scroll. "
"21103","Jeremiah","36","5","Then Jeremiah told Baruch, “I am restricted; I am not allowed to go to the Lord’s temple. "
"21104","Jeremiah","36","6","So you go to the house of the Lord on a day of fasting and read to the people from the scroll the words of the Lord that you wrote as I dictated. Read them to all the people of Judah who come in from their towns. "
"21105","Jeremiah","36","7","Perhaps they will bring their petition before the Lord and will each turn from their wicked ways, for the anger and wrath pronounced against this people by the Lord are great.”"
"21106","Jeremiah","36","8","Baruch son of Neriah did everything Jeremiah the prophet told him to do; at the Lord’s temple he read the words of the Lord from the scroll. "
"21107","Jeremiah","36","9","In the ninth month of the fifth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, a time of fasting before the Lord was proclaimed for all the people in Jerusalem and those who had come from the towns of Judah. "
"21108","Jeremiah","36","10","From the room of Gemariah son of Shaphan the secretary, which was in the upper courtyard at the entrance of the New Gate of the temple, Baruch read to all the people at the Lord’s temple the words of Jeremiah from the scroll."
"21109","Jeremiah","36","11","When Micaiah son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, heard all the words of the Lord from the scroll, "
"21110","Jeremiah","36","12","he went down to the secretary’s room in the royal palace, where all the officials were sitting: Elishama the secretary, Delaiah son of Shemaiah, Elnathan son of Akbor, Gemariah son of Shaphan, Zedekiah son of Hananiah, and all the other officials. "
"21111","Jeremiah","36","13","After Micaiah told them everything he had heard Baruch read to the people from the scroll, "
"21112","Jeremiah","36","14","all the officials sent Jehudi son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, to say to Baruch, “Bring the scroll from which you have read to the people and come.” So Baruch son of Neriah went to them with the scroll in his hand. "
"21113","Jeremiah","36","15","They said to him, “Sit down, please, and read it to us.”So Baruch read it to them. "
"21114","Jeremiah","36","16","When they heard all these words, they looked at each other in fear and said to Baruch, “We must report all these words to the king.” "
"21115","Jeremiah","36","17","Then they asked Baruch, “Tell us, how did you come to write all this? Did Jeremiah dictate it?” "
"21116","Jeremiah","36","18","""Yes,” Baruch replied, “he dictated all these words to me, and I wrote them in ink on the scroll.”"
"21117","Jeremiah","36","19","Then the officials said to Baruch, “You and Jeremiah, go and hide. Don’t let anyone know where you are.”"
"21118","Jeremiah","36","20","After they put the scroll in the room of Elishama the secretary, they went to the king in the courtyard and reported everything to him. "
"21119","Jeremiah","36","21","The king sent Jehudi to get the scroll, and Jehudi brought it from the room of Elishama the secretary and read it to the king and all the officials standing beside him. "
"21120","Jeremiah","36","22","It was the ninth month and the king was sitting in the winter apartment, with a fire burning in the firepot in front of him. "
"21121","Jeremiah","36","23","Whenever Jehudi had read three or four columns of the scroll, the king cut them off with a scribe’s knife and threw them into the firepot, until the entire scroll was burned in the fire. "
"21122","Jeremiah","36","24","The king and all his attendants who heard all these words showed no fear, nor did they tear their clothes. "
"21123","Jeremiah","36","25","Even though Elnathan, Delaiah and Gemariah urged the king not to burn the scroll, he would not listen to them. "
"21124","Jeremiah","36","26","Instead, the king commanded Jerahmeel, a son of the king, Seraiah son of Azriel and Shelemiah son of Abdeel to arrest Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet. But the Lord had hidden them."
"21125","Jeremiah","36","27","After the king burned the scroll containing the words that Baruch had written at Jeremiah’s dictation, the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah:  "
"21126","Jeremiah","36","28","""Take another scroll and write on it all the words that were on the first scroll, which Jehoiakim king of Judah burned up. "
"21127","Jeremiah","36","29","Also tell Jehoiakim king of Judah, ‘This is what the Lord says: You burned that scroll and said, “Why did you write on it that the king of Babylon would certainly come and destroy this land and wipe from it both man and beast?” "
"21128","Jeremiah","36","30","Therefore this is what the Lord says about Jehoiakim king of Judah: He will have no one to sit on the throne of David; his body will be thrown out and exposed to the heat by day and the frost by night. "
"21129","Jeremiah","36","31","I will punish him and his children and his attendants for their wickedness; I will bring on them and those living in Jerusalem and the people of Judah every disaster I pronounced against them, because they have not listened.’ ”"
"21130","Jeremiah","36","32","So Jeremiah took another scroll and gave it to the scribe Baruch son of Neriah, and as Jeremiah dictated, Baruch wrote on it all the words of the scroll that Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire. And many similar words were added to them."
"21131","Jeremiah","37","1","Zedekiah son of Josiah was made king of Judah by Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; he reigned in place of Jehoiachin37:1 Hebrew Koniah, a variant of Jehoiachin son of Jehoiakim. "
"21132","Jeremiah","37","2","Neither he nor his attendants nor the people of the land paid any attention to the words the Lord had spoken through Jeremiah the prophet."
"21133","Jeremiah","37","3","King Zedekiah, however, sent Jehukal son of Shelemiah with the priest Zephaniah son of Maaseiah to Jeremiah the prophet with this message: “Please pray to the Lord our God for us.”"
"21134","Jeremiah","37","4","Now Jeremiah was free to come and go among the people, for he had not yet been put in prison. "
"21135","Jeremiah","37","5","Pharaoh’s army had marched out of Egypt, and when the Babylonians37:5 Or Chaldeans; also in verses 8, 9, 13 and 14 who were besieging Jerusalem heard the report about them, they withdrew from Jerusalem."
"21136","Jeremiah","37","6","Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah the prophet:  "
"21137","Jeremiah","37","7","""This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: Tell the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of me, ‘Pharaoh’s army, which has marched out to support you, will go back to its own land, to Egypt. "
"21138","Jeremiah","37","8","Then the Babylonians will return and attack this city; they will capture it and burn it down.’ "
"21139","Jeremiah","37","9","""This is what the Lord says: Do not deceive yourselves, thinking, ‘The Babylonians will surely leave us.’ They will not! "
"21140","Jeremiah","37","10","Even if you were to defeat the entire Babylonian37:10 Or Chaldean; also in verse 11 army that is attacking you and only wounded men were left in their tents, they would come out and burn this city down.”"
"21141","Jeremiah","37","11","After the Babylonian army had withdrawn from Jerusalem because of Pharaoh’s army, "
"21142","Jeremiah","37","12","Jeremiah started to leave the city to go to the territory of Benjamin to get his share of the property among the people there. "
"21143","Jeremiah","37","13","But when he reached the Benjamin Gate, the captain of the guard, whose name was Irijah son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah, arrested him and said, “You are deserting to the Babylonians!” "
"21144","Jeremiah","37","14","""That’s not true!” Jeremiah said. “I am not deserting to the Babylonians.” But Irijah would not listen to him; instead, he arrested Jeremiah and brought him to the officials. "
"21145","Jeremiah","37","15","They were angry with Jeremiah and had him beaten and imprisoned in the house of Jonathan the secretary, which they had made into a prison."
"21146","Jeremiah","37","16","Jeremiah was put into a vaulted cell in a dungeon, where he remained a long time. "
"21147","Jeremiah","37","17","Then King Zedekiah sent for him and had him brought to the palace, where he asked him privately, “Is there any word from the Lord?”“Yes,” Jeremiah replied, “you will be delivered into the hands of the king of Babylon.”"
"21148","Jeremiah","37","18","Then Jeremiah said to King Zedekiah, “What crime have I committed against you or your attendants or this people, that you have put me in prison? "
"21149","Jeremiah","37","19","Where are your prophets who prophesied to you, ‘The king of Babylon will not attack you or this land’? "
"21150","Jeremiah","37","20","But now, my lord the king, please listen. Let me bring my petition before you: Do not send me back to the house of Jonathan the secretary, or I will die there.”"
"21151","Jeremiah","37","21","King Zedekiah then gave orders for Jeremiah to be placed in the courtyard of the guard and given a loaf of bread from the street of the bakers each day until all the bread in the city was gone. So Jeremiah remained in the courtyard of the guard."
"21152","Jeremiah","38","1","Shephatiah son of Mattan, Gedaliah son of Pashhur, Jehukal38:1 Hebrew Jukal, a variant of Jehukal son of Shelemiah, and Pashhur son of Malkijah heard what Jeremiah was telling all the people when he said,  "
"21153","Jeremiah","38","2","""This is what the Lord says: ‘Whoever stays in this city will die by the sword, famine or plague, but whoever goes over to the Babylonians38:2 Or Chaldeans; also in verses 18, 19 and 23 will live. They will escape with their lives; they will live.’ "
"21154","Jeremiah","38","3","And this is what the Lord says: ‘This city will certainly be given into the hands of the army of the king of Babylon, who will capture it.’ ”"
"21155","Jeremiah","38","4","Then the officials said to the king, “This man should be put to death. He is discouraging the soldiers who are left in this city, as well as all the people, by the things he is saying to them. This man is not seeking the good of these people but their ruin.” "
"21156","Jeremiah","38","5","""He is in your hands,” King Zedekiah answered. “The king can do nothing to oppose you.”"
"21157","Jeremiah","38","6","So they took Jeremiah and put him into the cistern of Malkijah, the king’s son, which was in the courtyard of the guard. They lowered Jeremiah by ropes into the cistern; it had no water in it, only mud, and Jeremiah sank down into the mud."
"21158","Jeremiah","38","7","But Ebed-Melek, a Cushite,38:7 Probably from the upper Nile region an official38:7 Or a eunuch in the royal palace, heard that they had put Jeremiah into the cistern. While the king was sitting in the Benjamin Gate, "
"21159","Jeremiah","38","8","Ebed-Melek went out of the palace and said to him,  "
"21160","Jeremiah","38","9","""My lord the king, these men have acted wickedly in all they have done to Jeremiah the prophet. They have thrown him into a cistern, where he will starve to death when there is no longer any bread in the city.”"
"21161","Jeremiah","38","10","Then the king commanded Ebed-Melek the Cushite, “Take thirty men from here with you and lift Jeremiah the prophet out of the cistern before he dies.”"
"21162","Jeremiah","38","11","So Ebed-Melek took the men with him and went to a room under the treasury in the palace. He took some old rags and worn-out clothes from there and let them down with ropes to Jeremiah in the cistern. "
"21163","Jeremiah","38","12","Ebed-Melek the Cushite said to Jeremiah, “Put these old rags and worn-out clothes under your arms to pad the ropes.” Jeremiah did so, "
"21164","Jeremiah","38","13","and they pulled him up with the ropes and lifted him out of the cistern. And Jeremiah remained in the courtyard of the guard.Zedekiah Questions Jeremiah Again"
"21165","Jeremiah","38","14","Then King Zedekiah sent for Jeremiah the prophet and had him brought to the third entrance to the temple of the Lord. “I am going to ask you something,” the king said to Jeremiah. “Do not hide anything from me.”"
"21166","Jeremiah","38","15","Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, “If I give you an answer, will you not kill me? Even if I did give you counsel, you would not listen to me.”"
"21167","Jeremiah","38","16","But King Zedekiah swore this oath secretly to Jeremiah: “As surely as the Lord lives, who has given us breath, I will neither kill you nor hand you over to those who want to kill you.”"
"21168","Jeremiah","38","17","Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, “This is what the Lord God Almighty, the God of Israel, says: ‘If you surrender to the officers of the king of Babylon, your life will be spared and this city will not be burned down; you and your family will live. "
"21169","Jeremiah","38","18","But if you will not surrender to the officers of the king of Babylon, this city will be given into the hands of the Babylonians and they will burn it down; you yourself will not escape from them.’ ”"
"21170","Jeremiah","38","19","King Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, “I am afraid of the Jews who have gone over to the Babylonians, for the Babylonians may hand me over to them and they will mistreat me.” "
"21171","Jeremiah","38","20","""They will not hand you over,” Jeremiah replied. “Obey the Lord by doing what I tell you. Then it will go well with you, and your life will be spared. "
"21172","Jeremiah","38","21","But if you refuse to surrender, this is what the Lord has revealed to me: "
"21173","Jeremiah","38","22","All the women left in the palace of the king of Judah will be brought out to the officials of the king of Babylon. Those women will say to you:“ ‘They misled you and overcame you—those trusted friends of yours.Your feet are sunk in the mud;your friends have deserted you.’ "
"21174","Jeremiah","38","23","""All your wives and children will be brought out to the Babylonians. You yourself will not escape from their hands but will be captured by the king of Babylon; and this city will38:23 Or and you will cause this city to be burned down.”"
"21175","Jeremiah","38","24","Then Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, “Do not let anyone know about this conversation, or you may die. "
"21176","Jeremiah","38","25","If the officials hear that I talked with you, and they come to you and say, ‘Tell us what you said to the king and what the king said to you; do not hide it from us or we will kill you,’ "
"21177","Jeremiah","38","26","then tell them, ‘I was pleading with the king not to send me back to Jonathan’s house to die there.’ ”"
"21178","Jeremiah","38","27","All the officials did come to Jeremiah and question him, and he told them everything the king had ordered him to say. So they said no more to him, for no one had heard his conversation with the king."
"21179","Jeremiah","38","28","And Jeremiah remained in the courtyard of the guard until the day Jerusalem was captured.The Fall of JerusalemThis is how Jerusalem was taken:"
"21180","Jeremiah","39","1","In the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon marched against Jerusalem with his whole army and laid siege to it. "
"21181","Jeremiah","39","2","And on the ninth day of the fourth month of Zedekiah’s eleventh year, the city wall was broken through. "
"21182","Jeremiah","39","3","Then all the officials of the king of Babylon came and took seats in the Middle Gate: Nergal-Sharezer of Samgar, Nebo-Sarsekim a chief officer, Nergal-Sharezer a high official and all the other officials of the king of Babylon. "
"21183","Jeremiah","39","4","When Zedekiah king of Judah and all the soldiers saw them, they fled; they left the city at night by way of the king’s garden, through the gate between the two walls, and headed toward the Arabah.39:4 Or the Jordan Valley"
"21184","Jeremiah","39","5","But the Babylonian39:5 Or Chaldean army pursued them and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho. They captured him and took him to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon at Riblah in the land of Hamath, where he pronounced sentence on him. "
"21185","Jeremiah","39","6","There at Riblah the king of Babylon slaughtered the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes and also killed all the nobles of Judah. "
"21186","Jeremiah","39","7","Then he put out Zedekiah’s eyes and bound him with bronze shackles to take him to Babylon."
"21187","Jeremiah","39","8","The Babylonians39:8 Or Chaldeans set fire to the royal palace and the houses of the people and broke down the walls of Jerusalem. "
"21188","Jeremiah","39","9","Nebuzaradan commander of the imperial guard carried into exile to Babylon the people who remained in the city, along with those who had gone over to him, and the rest of the people. "
"21189","Jeremiah","39","10","But Nebuzaradan the commander of the guard left behind in the land of Judah some of the poor people, who owned nothing; and at that time he gave them vineyards and fields."
"21190","Jeremiah","39","11","Now Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had given these orders about Jeremiah through Nebuzaradan commander of the imperial guard:  "
"21191","Jeremiah","39","12","""Take him and look after him; don’t harm him but do for him whatever he asks.” "
"21192","Jeremiah","39","13","So Nebuzaradan the commander of the guard, Nebushazban a chief officer, Nergal-Sharezer a high official and all the other officers of the king of Babylon "
"21193","Jeremiah","39","14","sent and had Jeremiah taken out of the courtyard of the guard. They turned him over to Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, to take him back to his home. So he remained among his own people."
"21194","Jeremiah","39","15","While Jeremiah had been confined in the courtyard of the guard, the word of the Lord came to him:  "
"21195","Jeremiah","39","16","""Go and tell Ebed-Melek the Cushite, ‘This is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says: I am about to fulfill my words against this city—words concerning disaster, not prosperity. At that time they will be fulfilled before your eyes. "
"21196","Jeremiah","39","17","But I will rescue you on that day, declares the Lord; you will not be given into the hands of those you fear. "
"21197","Jeremiah","39","18","I will save you; you will not fall by the sword but will escape with your life, because you trust in me, declares the Lord.’ ”"
"21198","Jeremiah","40","1","The word came to Jeremiah from the Lord after Nebuzaradan commander of the imperial guard had released him at Ramah. He had found Jeremiah bound in chains among all the captives from Jerusalem and Judah who were being carried into exile to Babylon. "
"21199","Jeremiah","40","2","When the commander of the guard found Jeremiah, he said to him, “The Lord your God decreed this disaster for this place. "
"21200","Jeremiah","40","3","And now the Lord has brought it about; he has done just as he said he would. All this happened because you people sinned against the Lord and did not obey him. "
"21201","Jeremiah","40","4","But today I am freeing you from the chains on your wrists. Come with me to Babylon, if you like, and I will look after you; but if you do not want to, then don’t come. Look, the whole country lies before you; go wherever you please.” "
"21202","Jeremiah","40","5","However, before Jeremiah turned to go,40:5 Or Jeremiah answered Nebuzaradan added, “Go back to Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon has appointed over the towns of Judah, and live with him among the people, or go anywhere else you please.”Then the commander gave him provisions and a present and let him go. "
"21203","Jeremiah","40","6","So Jeremiah went to Gedaliah son of Ahikam at Mizpah and stayed with him among the people who were left behind in the land.Gedaliah Assassinated"
"21204","Jeremiah","40","7","When all the army officers and their men who were still in the open country heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam as governor over the land and had put him in charge of the men, women and children who were the poorest in the land and who had not been carried into exile to Babylon, "
"21205","Jeremiah","40","8","they came to Gedaliah at Mizpah—Ishmael son of Nethaniah, Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, Seraiah son of Tanhumeth, the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah40:8 Hebrew Jezaniah, a variant of Jaazaniah the son of the Maakathite, and their men. "
"21206","Jeremiah","40","9","Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, took an oath to reassure them and their men. “Do not be afraid to serve the Babylonians,40:9 Or Chaldeans; also in verse 10” he said. “Settle down in the land and serve the king of Babylon, and it will go well with you. "
"21207","Jeremiah","40","10","I myself will stay at Mizpah to represent you before the Babylonians who come to us, but you are to harvest the wine, summer fruit and olive oil, and put them in your storage jars, and live in the towns you have taken over.”"
"21208","Jeremiah","40","11","When all the Jews in Moab, Ammon, Edom and all the other countries heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant in Judah and had appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, as governor over them, "
"21209","Jeremiah","40","12","they all came back to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah at Mizpah, from all the countries where they had been scattered. And they harvested an abundance of wine and summer fruit."
"21210","Jeremiah","40","13","Johanan son of Kareah and all the army officers still in the open country came to Gedaliah at Mizpah "
"21211","Jeremiah","40","14","and said to him, “Don’t you know that Baalis king of the Ammonites has sent Ishmael son of Nethaniah to take your life?” But Gedaliah son of Ahikam did not believe them."
"21212","Jeremiah","40","15","Then Johanan son of Kareah said privately to Gedaliah in Mizpah, “Let me go and kill Ishmael son of Nethaniah, and no one will know it. Why should he take your life and cause all the Jews who are gathered around you to be scattered and the remnant of Judah to perish?”"
"21213","Jeremiah","40","16","But Gedaliah son of Ahikam said to Johanan son of Kareah, “Don’t do such a thing! What you are saying about Ishmael is not true.”"
"21214","Jeremiah","41","1","In the seventh month Ishmael son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, who was of royal blood and had been one of the king’s officers, came with ten men to Gedaliah son of Ahikam at Mizpah. While they were eating together there, "
"21215","Jeremiah","41","2","Ishmael son of Nethaniah and the ten men who were with him got up and struck down Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, with the sword, killing the one whom the king of Babylon had appointed as governor over the land. "
"21216","Jeremiah","41","3","Ishmael also killed all the men of Judah who were with Gedaliah at Mizpah, as well as the Babylonian41:3 Or Chaldean soldiers who were there."
"21217","Jeremiah","41","4","The day after Gedaliah’s assassination, before anyone knew about it, "
"21218","Jeremiah","41","5","eighty men who had shaved off their beards, torn their clothes and cut themselves came from Shechem, Shiloh and Samaria, bringing grain offerings and incense with them to the house of the Lord. "
"21219","Jeremiah","41","6","Ishmael son of Nethaniah went out from Mizpah to meet them, weeping as he went. When he met them, he said, “Come to Gedaliah son of Ahikam.” "
"21220","Jeremiah","41","7","When they went into the city, Ishmael son of Nethaniah and the men who were with him slaughtered them and threw them into a cistern. "
"21221","Jeremiah","41","8","But ten of them said to Ishmael, “Don’t kill us! We have wheat and barley, olive oil and honey, hidden in a field.” So he let them alone and did not kill them with the others. "
"21222","Jeremiah","41","9","Now the cistern where he threw all the bodies of the men he had killed along with Gedaliah was the one King Asa had made as part of his defense against Baasha king of Israel. Ishmael son of Nethaniah filled it with the dead."
"21223","Jeremiah","41","10","Ishmael made captives of all the rest of the people who were in Mizpah—the king’s daughters along with all the others who were left there, over whom Nebuzaradan commander of the imperial guard had appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam. Ishmael son of Nethaniah took them captive and set out to cross over to the Ammonites."
"21224","Jeremiah","41","11","When Johanan son of Kareah and all the army officers who were with him heard about all the crimes Ishmael son of Nethaniah had committed, "
"21225","Jeremiah","41","12","they took all their men and went to fight Ishmael son of Nethaniah. They caught up with him near the great pool in Gibeon. "
"21226","Jeremiah","41","13","When all the people Ishmael had with him saw Johanan son of Kareah and the army officers who were with him, they were glad. "
"21227","Jeremiah","41","14","All the people Ishmael had taken captive at Mizpah turned and went over to Johanan son of Kareah. "
"21228","Jeremiah","41","15","But Ishmael son of Nethaniah and eight of his men escaped from Johanan and fled to the Ammonites.Flight to Egypt"
"21229","Jeremiah","41","16","Then Johanan son of Kareah and all the army officers who were with him led away all the people of Mizpah who had survived, whom Johanan had recovered from Ishmael son of Nethaniah after Ishmael had assassinated Gedaliah son of Ahikam—the soldiers, women, children and court officials he had recovered from Gibeon. "
"21230","Jeremiah","41","17","And they went on, stopping at Geruth Kimham near Bethlehem on their way to Egypt "
"21231","Jeremiah","41","18","to escape the Babylonians.41:18 Or Chaldeans They were afraid of them because Ishmael son of Nethaniah had killed Gedaliah son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon had appointed as governor over the land."
"21232","Jeremiah","42","1","Then all the army officers, including Johanan son of Kareah and Jezaniah42:1 Hebrew; Septuagint (see also 43:2) Azariah son of Hoshaiah, and all the people from the least to the greatest approached "
"21233","Jeremiah","42","2","Jeremiah the prophet and said to him, “Please hear our petition and pray to the Lord your God for this entire remnant. For as you now see, though we were once many, now only a few are left. "
"21234","Jeremiah","42","3","Pray that the Lord your God will tell us where we should go and what we should do.” "
"21235","Jeremiah","42","4","""I have heard you,” replied Jeremiah the prophet. “I will certainly pray to the Lord your God as you have requested; I will tell you everything the Lord says and will keep nothing back from you.”"
"21236","Jeremiah","42","5","Then they said to Jeremiah, “May the Lord be a true and faithful witness against us if we do not act in accordance with everything the Lord your God sends you to tell us. "
"21237","Jeremiah","42","6","Whether it is favorable or unfavorable, we will obey the Lord our God, to whom we are sending you, so that it will go well with us, for we will obey the Lord our God.”"
"21238","Jeremiah","42","7","Ten days later the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah. "
"21239","Jeremiah","42","8","So he called together Johanan son of Kareah and all the army officers who were with him and all the people from the least to the greatest. "
"21240","Jeremiah","42","9","He said to them, “This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, to whom you sent me to present your petition, says: 10‘If you stay in this land, I will build you up and not tear you down; I will plant you and not uproot you, for I have relented concerning the disaster I have inflicted on you. "
"21241","Jeremiah","42","11","Do not be afraid of the king of Babylon, whom you now fear. Do not be afraid of him, declares the Lord, for I am with you and will save you and deliver you from his hands. "
"21242","Jeremiah","42","12","I will show you compassion so that he will have compassion on you and restore you to your land.’ "
"21243","Jeremiah","42","13","""However, if you say, ‘We will not stay in this land,’ and so disobey the Lord your God, "
"21244","Jeremiah","42","14","and if you say, ‘No, we will go and live in Egypt, where we will not see war or hear the trumpet or be hungry for bread,’ "
"21245","Jeremiah","42","15","then hear the word of the Lord, you remnant of Judah. This is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says: ‘If you are determined to go to Egypt and you do go to settle there, "
"21246","Jeremiah","42","16","then the sword you fear will overtake you there, and the famine you dread will follow you into Egypt, and there you will die. "
"21247","Jeremiah","42","17","Indeed, all who are determined to go to Egypt to settle there will die by the sword, famine and plague; not one of them will survive or escape the disaster I will bring on them.’ "
"21248","Jeremiah","42","18","This is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says: ‘As my anger and wrath have been poured out on those who lived in Jerusalem, so will my wrath be poured out on you when you go to Egypt. You will be a curse42:18 That is, your name will be used in cursing (see 29:22); or, others will see that you are cursed. and an object of horror, a curse42:18 That is, your name will be used in cursing (see 29:22); or, others will see that you are cursed. and an object of reproach; you will never see this place again.’ "
"21249","Jeremiah","42","19","""Remnant of Judah, the Lord has told you, ‘Do not go to Egypt.’ Be sure of this: I warn you today "
"21250","Jeremiah","42","20","that you made a fatal mistake when you sent me to the Lord your God and said, ‘Pray to the Lord our God for us; tell us everything he says and we will do it.’ "
"21251","Jeremiah","42","21","I have told you today, but you still have not obeyed the Lord your God in all he sent me to tell you. "
"21252","Jeremiah","42","22","So now, be sure of this: You will die by the sword, famine and plague in the place where you want to go to settle.”"
"21253","Jeremiah","43","1","When Jeremiah had finished telling the people all the words of the Lord their God—everything the Lord had sent him to tell them— "
"21254","Jeremiah","43","2","Azariah son of Hoshaiah and Johanan son of Kareah and all the arrogant men said to Jeremiah, “You are lying! The Lord our God has not sent you to say, ‘You must not go to Egypt to settle there.’ "
"21255","Jeremiah","43","3","But Baruch son of Neriah is inciting you against us to hand us over to the Babylonians,43:3 Or Chaldeans so they may kill us or carry us into exile to Babylon.”"
"21256","Jeremiah","43","4","So Johanan son of Kareah and all the army officers and all the people disobeyed the Lord’s command to stay in the land of Judah. "
"21257","Jeremiah","43","5","Instead, Johanan son of Kareah and all the army officers led away all the remnant of Judah who had come back to live in the land of Judah from all the nations where they had been scattered. "
"21258","Jeremiah","43","6","They also led away all those whom Nebuzaradan commander of the imperial guard had left with Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan—the men, the women, the children and the king’s daughters. And they took Jeremiah the prophet and Baruch son of Neriah along with them. "
"21259","Jeremiah","43","7","So they entered Egypt in disobedience to the Lord and went as far as Tahpanhes."
"21260","Jeremiah","43","8","In Tahpanhes the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah:  "
"21261","Jeremiah","43","9","""While the Jews are watching, take some large stones with you and bury them in clay in the brick pavement at the entrance to Pharaoh’s palace in Tahpanhes. "
"21262","Jeremiah","43","10","Then say to them, ‘This is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says: I will send for my servant Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and I will set his throne over these stones I have buried here; he will spread his royal canopy above them. "
"21263","Jeremiah","43","11","He will come and attack Egypt, bringing death to those destined for death, captivity to those destined for captivity, and the sword to those destined for the sword. "
"21264","Jeremiah","43","12","He will set fire to the temples of the gods of Egypt; he will burn their temples and take their gods captive. As a shepherd picks his garment clean of lice, so he will pick Egypt clean and depart. "
"21265","Jeremiah","43","13","There in the temple of the sun43:13 Or in Heliopolis in Egypt he will demolish the sacred pillars and will burn down the temples of the gods of Egypt.’ ”"
"21266","Jeremiah","44","1","This word came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews living in Lower Egypt—in Migdol, Tahpanhes and Memphis—and in Upper Egypt:  "
"21267","Jeremiah","44","2","""This is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says: You saw the great disaster I brought on Jerusalem and on all the towns of Judah. Today they lie deserted and in ruins "
"21268","Jeremiah","44","3","because of the evil they have done. They aroused my anger by burning incense to and worshiping other gods that neither they nor you nor your ancestors ever knew. "
"21269","Jeremiah","44","4","Again and again I sent my servants the prophets, who said, ‘Do not do this detestable thing that I hate!’ "
"21270","Jeremiah","44","5","But they did not listen or pay attention; they did not turn from their wickedness or stop burning incense to other gods. "
"21271","Jeremiah","44","6","Therefore, my fierce anger was poured out; it raged against the towns of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem and made them the desolate ruins they are today. "
"21272","Jeremiah","44","7","""Now this is what the Lord God Almighty, the God of Israel, says: Why bring such great disaster on yourselves by cutting off from Judah the men and women, the children and infants, and so leave yourselves without a remnant? "
"21273","Jeremiah","44","8","Why arouse my anger with what your hands have made, burning incense to other gods in Egypt, where you have come to live? You will destroy yourselves and make yourselves a curse44:8 That is, your name will be used in cursing (see 29:22); or, others will see that you are cursed; also in verse 12; similarly in verse 22. and an object of reproach among all the nations on earth. "
"21274","Jeremiah","44","9","Have you forgotten the wickedness committed by your ancestors and by the kings and queens of Judah and the wickedness committed by you and your wives in the land of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem? "
"21275","Jeremiah","44","10","To this day they have not humbled themselves or shown reverence, nor have they followed my law and the decrees I set before you and your ancestors. "
"21276","Jeremiah","44","11","""Therefore this is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says: I am determined to bring disaster on you and to destroy all Judah. "
"21277","Jeremiah","44","12","I will take away the remnant of Judah who were determined to go to Egypt to settle there. They will all perish in Egypt; they will fall by the sword or die from famine. From the least to the greatest, they will die by sword or famine. They will become a curse and an object of horror, a curse and an object of reproach. "
"21278","Jeremiah","44","13","I will punish those who live in Egypt with the sword, famine and plague, as I punished Jerusalem. "
"21279","Jeremiah","44","14","None of the remnant of Judah who have gone to live in Egypt will escape or survive to return to the land of Judah, to which they long to return and live; none will return except a few fugitives.”"
"21280","Jeremiah","44","15","Then all the men who knew that their wives were burning incense to other gods, along with all the women who were present—a large assembly—and all the people living in Lower and Upper Egypt, said to Jeremiah,  "
"21281","Jeremiah","44","16","""We will not listen to the message you have spoken to us in the name of the Lord! "
"21282","Jeremiah","44","17","We will certainly do everything we said we would: We will burn incense to the Queen of Heaven and will pour out drink offerings to her just as we and our ancestors, our kings and our officials did in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem. At that time we had plenty of food and were well off and suffered no harm. "
"21283","Jeremiah","44","18","But ever since we stopped burning incense to the Queen of Heaven and pouring out drink offerings to her, we have had nothing and have been perishing by sword and famine.”"
"21284","Jeremiah","44","19","The women added, “When we burned incense to the Queen of Heaven and poured out drink offerings to her, did not our husbands know that we were making cakes impressed with her image and pouring out drink offerings to her?”"
"21285","Jeremiah","44","20","Then Jeremiah said to all the people, both men and women, who were answering him,  "
"21286","Jeremiah","44","21","""Did not the Lord remember and call to mind the incense burned in the towns of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem by you and your ancestors, your kings and your officials and the people of the land? "
"21287","Jeremiah","44","22","When the Lord could no longer endure your wicked actions and the detestable things you did, your land became a curse and a desolate waste without inhabitants, as it is today. "
"21288","Jeremiah","44","23","Because you have burned incense and have sinned against the Lord and have not obeyed him or followed his law or his decrees or his stipulations, this disaster has come upon you, as you now see.”"
"21289","Jeremiah","44","24","Then Jeremiah said to all the people, including the women, “Hear the word of the Lord, all you people of Judah in Egypt. "
"21290","Jeremiah","44","25","This is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says: You and your wives have done what you said you would do when you promised, ‘We will certainly carry out the vows we made to burn incense and pour out drink offerings to the Queen of Heaven.’“Go ahead then, do what you promised! Keep your vows! "
"21291","Jeremiah","44","26","But hear the word of the Lord, all you Jews living in Egypt: ‘I swear by my great name,’ says the Lord, ‘that no one from Judah living anywhere in Egypt will ever again invoke my name or swear, “As surely as the Sovereign Lord lives.” "
"21292","Jeremiah","44","27","For I am watching over them for harm, not for good; the Jews in Egypt will perish by sword and famine until they are all destroyed. "
"21293","Jeremiah","44","28","Those who escape the sword and return to the land of Judah from Egypt will be very few. Then the whole remnant of Judah who came to live in Egypt will know whose word will stand—mine or theirs. "
"21294","Jeremiah","44","29",""" ‘This will be the sign to you that I will punish you in this place,’ declares the Lord, ‘so that you will know that my threats of harm against you will surely stand.’ "
"21295","Jeremiah","44","30","This is what the Lord says: ‘I am going to deliver Pharaoh Hophra king of Egypt into the hands of his enemies who want to kill him, just as I gave Zedekiah king of Judah into the hands of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, the enemy who wanted to kill him.’ ”"
"21296","Jeremiah","45","1","When Baruch son of Neriah wrote on a scroll the words Jeremiah the prophet dictated in the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, Jeremiah said this to Baruch:  "
"21297","Jeremiah","45","2","""This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says to you, Baruch: "
"21298","Jeremiah","45","3","You said, ‘Woe to me! The Lord has added sorrow to my pain; I am worn out with groaning and find no rest.’ "
"21299","Jeremiah","45","4","But the Lord has told me to say to you, ‘This is what the Lord says: I will overthrow what I have built and uproot what I have planted, throughout the earth. "
"21300","Jeremiah","45","5","Should you then seek great things for yourself? Do not seek them. For I will bring disaster on all people, declares the Lord, but wherever you go I will let you escape with your life.’ ”"
"21301","Jeremiah","46","1","This is the word of the Lord that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning the nations:"
"21302","Jeremiah","46","2","Concerning Egypt:This is the message against the army of Pharaoh Necho king of Egypt, which was defeated at Carchemish on the Euphrates River by Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon in the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah: "

"21525","Jeremiah","51","59","This is the message Jeremiah the prophet gave to the staff officer Seraiah son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, when he went to Babylon with Zedekiah king of Judah in the fourth year of his reign. "

"21530","Jeremiah","51","64","Then say, ‘So will Babylon sink to rise no more because of the disaster I will bring on her. And her people will fall.’ ”The words of Jeremiah end here."
"21531","Jeremiah","52","1","Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem eleven years. His mother’s name was Hamutal daughter of Jeremiah; she was from Libnah. "
"21532","Jeremiah","52","2","He did evil in the eyes of the Lord, just as Jehoiakim had done. "
"21533","Jeremiah","52","3","It was because of the Lord’s anger that all this happened to Jerusalem and Judah, and in the end he thrust them from his presence.Now Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon."
"21534","Jeremiah","52","4","So in the ninth year of Zedekiah’s reign, on the tenth day of the tenth month, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon marched against Jerusalem with his whole army. They encamped outside the city and built siege works all around it. "
"21535","Jeremiah","52","5","The city was kept under siege until the eleventh year of King Zedekiah."

"21541","Jeremiah","52","11","Then he put out Zedekiah’s eyes, bound him with bronze shackles and took him to Babylon, where he put him in prison till the day of his death."
"21542","Jeremiah","52","12","On the tenth day of the fifth month, in the nineteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, Nebuzaradan commander of the imperial guard, who served the king of Babylon, came to Jerusalem. "

"21549","Jeremiah","52","19","The commander of the imperial guard took away the basins, censers, sprinkling bowls, pots, lampstands, dishes and bowls used for drink offerings—all that were made of pure gold or silver."
"21550","Jeremiah","52","20","The bronze from the two pillars, the Sea and the twelve bronze bulls under it, and the movable stands, which King Solomon had made for the temple of the Lord, was more than could be weighed. "
"21551","Jeremiah","52","21","Each pillar was eighteen cubits high and twelve cubits in circumference52:21 That is, about 27 feet high and 18 feet in circumference or about 8.1 meters high and 5.4 meters in circumference; each was four fingers thick, and hollow. "
"21552","Jeremiah","52","22","The bronze capital on top of one pillar was five cubits52:22 That is, about 7 1/2 feet or about 2.3 meters high and was decorated with a network and pomegranates of bronze all around. The other pillar, with its pomegranates, was similar. "
"21553","Jeremiah","52","23","There were ninety-six pomegranates on the sides; the total number of pomegranates above the surrounding network was a hundred."
"21554","Jeremiah","52","24","The commander of the guard took as prisoners Seraiah the chief priest, Zephaniah the priest next in rank and the three doorkeepers. "
"21555","Jeremiah","52","25","Of those still in the city, he took the officer in charge of the fighting men, and seven royal advisers. He also took the secretary who was chief officer in charge of conscripting the people of the land, sixty of whom were found in the city. "
"21556","Jeremiah","52","26","Nebuzaradan the commander took them all and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah. "
"21557","Jeremiah","52","27","There at Riblah, in the land of Hamath, the king had them executed.So Judah went into captivity, away from her land. "

"21561","Jeremiah","52","31","In the thirty-seventh year of the exile of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the year Awel-Marduk became king of Babylon, on the twenty-fifth day of the twelfth month, he released Jehoiachin king of Judah and freed him from prison. "
"21562","Jeremiah","52","32","He spoke kindly to him and gave him a seat of honor higher than those of the other kings who were with him in Babylon. "
"21563","Jeremiah","52","33","So Jehoiachin put aside his prison clothes and for the rest of his life ate regularly at the king’s table. "

"21618","Lamentations","3","10","Like a bear lying in wait,like a lion in hiding,"
"21619","Lamentations","3","11","he dragged me from the path and mangled meand left me without help."
"21620","Lamentations","3","12","He drew his bowand made me the target for his arrows."
"21621","Lamentations","3","13","He pierced my heartwith arrows from his quiver."
"21622","Lamentations","3","14","I became the laughingstock of all my people;they mock me in song all day long."

"21719","Ezekiel","1","1","In my thirtieth year, in the fourth month on the fifth day, while I was among the exiles by the Kebar River, the heavens were opened and I saw visions of God."
"21720","Ezekiel","1","2","On the fifth of the month—it was the fifth year of the exile of King Jehoiachin— "
"21721","Ezekiel","1","3","the word of the Lord came to Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, by the Kebar River in the land of the Babylonians.1:3 Or Chaldeans There the hand of the Lord was on him."
"21722","Ezekiel","1","4","I looked, and I saw a windstorm coming out of the north—an immense cloud with flashing lightning and surrounded by brilliant light. The center of the fire looked like glowing metal, "
"21723","Ezekiel","1","5","and in the fire was what looked like four living creatures. In appearance their form was human, "
"21724","Ezekiel","1","6","but each of them had four faces and four wings. "
"21725","Ezekiel","1","7","Their legs were straight; their feet were like those of a calf and gleamed like burnished bronze. "
"21726","Ezekiel","1","8","Under their wings on their four sides they had human hands. All four of them had faces and wings, "
"21727","Ezekiel","1","9","and the wings of one touched the wings of another. Each one went straight ahead; they did not turn as they moved."
"21728","Ezekiel","1","10","Their faces looked like this: Each of the four had the face of a human being, and on the right side each had the face of a lion, and on the left the face of an ox; each also had the face of an eagle. "
"21729","Ezekiel","1","11","Such were their faces. They each had two wings spreading out upward, each wing touching that of the creature on either side; and each had two other wings covering its body. "
"21730","Ezekiel","1","12","Each one went straight ahead. Wherever the spirit would go, they would go, without turning as they went. "
"21731","Ezekiel","1","13","The appearance of the living creatures was like burning coals of fire or like torches. Fire moved back and forth among the creatures; it was bright, and lightning flashed out of it. "
"21732","Ezekiel","1","14","The creatures sped back and forth like flashes of lightning."
"21733","Ezekiel","1","15","As I looked at the living creatures, I saw a wheel on the ground beside each creature with its four faces. "
"21734","Ezekiel","1","16","This was the appearance and structure of the wheels: They sparkled like topaz, and all four looked alike. Each appeared to be made like a wheel intersecting a wheel. "
"21735","Ezekiel","1","17","As they moved, they would go in any one of the four directions the creatures faced; the wheels did not change direction as the creatures went. "
"21736","Ezekiel","1","18","Their rims were high and awesome, and all four rims were full of eyes all around."
"21737","Ezekiel","1","19","When the living creatures moved, the wheels beside them moved; and when the living creatures rose from the ground, the wheels also rose. "
"21738","Ezekiel","1","20","Wherever the spirit would go, they would go, and the wheels would rise along with them, because the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels. "
"21739","Ezekiel","1","21","When the creatures moved, they also moved; when the creatures stood still, they also stood still; and when the creatures rose from the ground, the wheels rose along with them, because the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels."
"21740","Ezekiel","1","22","Spread out above the heads of the living creatures was what looked something like a vault, sparkling like crystal, and awesome. "
"21741","Ezekiel","1","23","Under the vault their wings were stretched out one toward the other, and each had two wings covering its body. "
"21742","Ezekiel","1","24","When the creatures moved, I heard the sound of their wings, like the roar of rushing waters, like the voice of the Almighty,1:24 Hebrew Shaddai like the tumult of an army. When they stood still, they lowered their wings."
"21743","Ezekiel","1","25","Then there came a voice from above the vault over their heads as they stood with lowered wings. "
"21744","Ezekiel","1","26","Above the vault over their heads was what looked like a throne of lapis lazuli, and high above on the throne was a figure like that of a man. "
"21745","Ezekiel","1","27","I saw that from what appeared to be his waist up he looked like glowing metal, as if full of fire, and that from there down he looked like fire; and brilliant light surrounded him. "
"21746","Ezekiel","1","28","Like the appearance of a rainbow in the clouds on a rainy day, so was the radiance around him.This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the Lord. When I saw it, I fell facedown, and I heard the voice of one speaking."
"21747","Ezekiel","2","1","He said to me, “Son of man,2:1 The Hebrew phrase ben adam means human being. The phrase son of man is retained as a form of address here and throughout Ezekiel because of its possible association with “Son of Man” in the New Testament. stand up on your feet and I will speak to you.” "
"21748","Ezekiel","2","2","As he spoke, the Spirit came into me and raised me to my feet, and I heard him speaking to me."
"21749","Ezekiel","2","3","He said: “Son of man, I am sending you to the Israelites, to a rebellious nation that has rebelled against me; they and their ancestors have been in revolt against me to this very day. "
"21750","Ezekiel","2","4","The people to whom I am sending you are obstinate and stubborn. Say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says.’ "
"21751","Ezekiel","2","5","And whether they listen or fail to listen—for they are a rebellious people—they will know that a prophet has been among them. "
"21752","Ezekiel","2","6","And you, son of man, do not be afraid of them or their words. Do not be afraid, though briers and thorns are all around you and you live among scorpions. Do not be afraid of what they say or be terrified by them, though they are a rebellious people. "
"21753","Ezekiel","2","7","You must speak my words to them, whether they listen or fail to listen, for they are rebellious. "
"21754","Ezekiel","2","8","But you, son of man, listen to what I say to you. Do not rebel like that rebellious people; open your mouth and eat what I give you.”"
"21755","Ezekiel","2","9","Then I looked, and I saw a hand stretched out to me. In it was a scroll, "
"21756","Ezekiel","2","10","which he unrolled before me. On both sides of it were written words of lament and mourning and woe."
"21757","Ezekiel","3","1","And he said to me, “Son of man, eat what is before you, eat this scroll; then go and speak to the people of Israel.” "
"21758","Ezekiel","3","2","So I opened my mouth, and he gave me the scroll to eat."
"21759","Ezekiel","3","3","Then he said to me, “Son of man, eat this scroll I am giving you and fill your stomach with it.” So I ate it, and it tasted as sweet as honey in my mouth."
"21760","Ezekiel","3","4","He then said to me: “Son of man, go now to the people of Israel and speak my words to them. "
"21761","Ezekiel","3","5","You are not being sent to a people of obscure speech and strange language, but to the people of Israel— "
"21762","Ezekiel","3","6","not to many peoples of obscure speech and strange language, whose words you cannot understand. Surely if I had sent you to them, they would have listened to you. "
"21763","Ezekiel","3","7","But the people of Israel are not willing to listen to you because they are not willing to listen to me, for all the Israelites are hardened and obstinate. "
"21764","Ezekiel","3","8","But I will make you as unyielding and hardened as they are. "
"21765","Ezekiel","3","9","I will make your forehead like the hardest stone, harder than flint. Do not be afraid of them or terrified by them, though they are a rebellious people.”"
"21766","Ezekiel","3","10","And he said to me, “Son of man, listen carefully and take to heart all the words I speak to you. "
"21767","Ezekiel","3","11","Go now to your people in exile and speak to them. Say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says,’ whether they listen or fail to listen.”"
"21768","Ezekiel","3","12","Then the Spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me a loud rumbling sound as the glory of the Lord rose from the place where it was standing.3:12 Probable reading of the original Hebrew text; Masoretic Text sound—may the glory of the Lord be praised from his place "
"21769","Ezekiel","3","13","It was the sound of the wings of the living creatures brushing against each other and the sound of the wheels beside them, a loud rumbling sound. "
"21770","Ezekiel","3","14","The Spirit then lifted me up and took me away, and I went in bitterness and in the anger of my spirit, with the strong hand of the Lord on me. "
"21771","Ezekiel","3","15","I came to the exiles who lived at Tel Aviv near the Kebar River. And there, where they were living, I sat among them for seven days—deeply distressed.Ezekiel’s Task as Watchman"
"21772","Ezekiel","3","16","At the end of seven days the word of the Lord came to me:  "
"21773","Ezekiel","3","17","""Son of man, I have made you a watchman for the people of Israel; so hear the word I speak and give them warning from me. "
"21774","Ezekiel","3","18","When I say to a wicked person, ‘You will surely die,’ and you do not warn them or speak out to dissuade them from their evil ways in order to save their life, that wicked person will die for3:18 Or in; also in verses 19 and 20 their sin, and I will hold you accountable for their blood. "
"21775","Ezekiel","3","19","But if you do warn the wicked person and they do not turn from their wickedness or from their evil ways, they will die for their sin; but you will have saved yourself. "
"21776","Ezekiel","3","20","""Again, when a righteous person turns from their righteousness and does evil, and I put a stumbling block before them, they will die. Since you did not warn them, they will die for their sin. The righteous things that person did will not be remembered, and I will hold you accountable for their blood. "
"21777","Ezekiel","3","21","But if you do warn the righteous person not to sin and they do not sin, they will surely live because they took warning, and you will have saved yourself.”"
"21778","Ezekiel","3","22","The hand of the Lord was on me there, and he said to me, “Get up and go out to the plain, and there I will speak to you.” "
"21779","Ezekiel","3","23","So I got up and went out to the plain. And the glory of the Lord was standing there, like the glory I had seen by the Kebar River, and I fell facedown."
"21780","Ezekiel","3","24","Then the Spirit came into me and raised me to my feet. He spoke to me and said: “Go, shut yourself inside your house. "
"21781","Ezekiel","3","25","And you, son of man, they will tie with ropes; you will be bound so that you cannot go out among the people. "
"21782","Ezekiel","3","26","I will make your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth so that you will be silent and unable to rebuke them, for they are a rebellious people. "
"21783","Ezekiel","3","27","But when I speak to you, I will open your mouth and you shall say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says.’ Whoever will listen let them listen, and whoever will refuse let them refuse; for they are a rebellious people."
"21784","Ezekiel","4","1","Also measure out a sixth of a hin4:11 That is, about 2/3 quart or about 0.6 liter of water and drink it at set times. "
"21785","Ezekiel","4","12","Eat the food as you would a loaf of barley bread; bake it in the sight of the people, using human excrement for fuel.” "
"21786","Ezekiel","4","13","The Lord said, “In this way the people of Israel will eat defiled food among the nations where I will drive them.”"
"21787","Ezekiel","4","14","Then I said, “Not so, Sovereign Lord! I have never defiled myself. From my youth until now I have never eaten anything found dead or torn by wild animals. No impure meat has ever entered my mouth.” "
"21788","Ezekiel","4","15","""Very well,” he said, “I will let you bake your bread over cow dung instead of human excrement.”"
"21789","Ezekiel","4","16","He then said to me: “Son of man, I am about to cut off the food supply in Jerusalem. The people will eat rationed food in anxiety and drink rationed water in despair, "
"21790","Ezekiel","4","17","for food and water will be scarce. They will be appalled at the sight of each other and will waste away because of4:17 Or away in their sin."
"21791","Ezekiel","5","1","Therefore as surely as I live, declares the Sovereign Lord, because you have defiled my sanctuary with all your vile images and detestable practices, I myself will shave you; I will not look on you with pity or spare you. "
"21792","Ezekiel","5","12","A third of your people will die of the plague or perish by famine inside you; a third will fall by the sword outside your walls; and a third I will scatter to the winds and pursue with drawn sword. "
"21793","Ezekiel","5","13","""Then my anger will cease and my wrath against them will subside, and I will be avenged. And when I have spent my wrath on them, they will know that I the Lord have spoken in my zeal. "
"21794","Ezekiel","5","14","""I will make you a ruin and a reproach among the nations around you, in the sight of all who pass by. "
"21795","Ezekiel","5","15","You will be a reproach and a taunt, a warning and an object of horror to the nations around you when I inflict punishment on you in anger and in wrath and with stinging rebuke. I the Lord have spoken. "
"21796","Ezekiel","5","16","When I shoot at you with my deadly and destructive arrows of famine, I will shoot to destroy you. I will bring more and more famine upon you and cut off your supply of food. "
"21797","Ezekiel","5","17","I will send famine and wild beasts against you, and they will leave you childless. Plague and bloodshed will sweep through you, and I will bring the sword against you. I the Lord have spoken.”"
"21798","Ezekiel","6","1","The word of the Lord came to me:  "
"21799","Ezekiel","6","2","""Son of man, set your face against the mountains of Israel; prophesy against them "
"21800","Ezekiel","6","3","and say: ‘You mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Sovereign Lord. This is what the Sovereign Lord says to the mountains and hills, to the ravines and valleys: I am about to bring a sword against you, and I will destroy your high places. "

"21802","Ezekiel","6","5","I will lay the dead bodies of the Israelites in front of their idols, and I will scatter your bones around your altars. "
"21803","Ezekiel","6","6","Wherever you live, the towns will be laid waste and the high places demolished, so that your altars will be laid waste and devastated, your idols smashed and ruined, your incense altars broken down, and what you have made wiped out. "

"21840","Ezekiel","8","2","I looked, and I saw a figure like that of a man.8:2 Or saw a fiery figure From what appeared to be his waist down he was like fire, and from there up his appearance was as bright as glowing metal. "
"21841","Ezekiel","8","3","He stretched out what looked like a hand and took me by the hair of my head. The Spirit lifted me up between earth and heaven and in visions of God he took me to Jerusalem, to the entrance of the north gate of the inner court, where the idol that provokes to jealousy stood. "
"21842","Ezekiel","8","4","And there before me was the glory of the God of Israel, as in the vision I had seen in the plain."
"21843","Ezekiel","8","5","Then he said to me, “Son of man, look toward the north.” So I looked, and in the entrance north of the gate of the altar I saw this idol of jealousy."
"21844","Ezekiel","8","6","And he said to me, “Son of man, do you see what they are doing—the utterly detestable things the Israelites are doing here, things that will drive me far from my sanctuary? But you will see things that are even more detestable.”"
"21845","Ezekiel","8","7","Then he brought me to the entrance to the court. I looked, and I saw a hole in the wall. "
"21846","Ezekiel","8","8","He said to me, “Son of man, now dig into the wall.” So I dug into the wall and saw a doorway there."
"21847","Ezekiel","8","9","And he said to me, “Go in and see the wicked and detestable things they are doing here.” "
"21848","Ezekiel","8","10","So I went in and looked, and I saw portrayed all over the walls all kinds of crawling things and unclean animals and all the idols of Israel. "
"21849","Ezekiel","8","11","In front of them stood seventy elders of Israel, and Jaazaniah son of Shaphan was standing among them. Each had a censer in his hand, and a fragrant cloud of incense was rising."
"21850","Ezekiel","8","12","He said to me, “Son of man, have you seen what the elders of Israel are doing in the darkness, each at the shrine of his own idol? They say, ‘The Lord does not see us; the Lord has forsaken the land.’ ” "
"21851","Ezekiel","8","13","Again, he said, “You will see them doing things that are even more detestable.”"
"21852","Ezekiel","8","14","Then he brought me to the entrance of the north gate of the house of the Lord, and I saw women sitting there, mourning the god Tammuz. "
"21853","Ezekiel","8","15","He said to me, “Do you see this, son of man? You will see things that are even more detestable than this.”"
"21854","Ezekiel","8","16","He then brought me into the inner court of the house of the Lord, and there at the entrance to the temple, between the portico and the altar, were about twenty-five men. With their backs toward the temple of the Lord and their faces toward the east, they were bowing down to the sun in the east."
"21855","Ezekiel","8","17","He said to me, “Have you seen this, son of man? Is it a trivial matter for the people of Judah to do the detestable things they are doing here? Must they also fill the land with violence and continually arouse my anger? Look at them putting the branch to their nose! "
"21856","Ezekiel","8","18","Therefore I will deal with them in anger; I will not look on them with pity or spare them. Although they shout in my ears, I will not listen to them.”"
"21857","Ezekiel","9","1","Then I heard him call out in a loud voice, “Bring near those who are appointed to execute judgment on the city, each with a weapon in his hand.” "
"21858","Ezekiel","9","2","And I saw six men coming from the direction of the upper gate, which faces north, each with a deadly weapon in his hand. With them was a man clothed in linen who had a writing kit at his side. They came in and stood beside the bronze altar."
"21859","Ezekiel","9","3","Now the glory of the God of Israel went up from above the cherubim, where it had been, and moved to the threshold of the temple. Then the Lord called to the man clothed in linen who had the writing kit at his side "
"21860","Ezekiel","9","4","and said to him, “Go throughout the city of Jerusalem and put a mark on the foreheads of those who grieve and lament over all the detestable things that are done in it.”"

"21862","Ezekiel","9","6","Slaughter the old men, the young men and women, the mothers and children, but do not touch anyone who has the mark. Begin at my sanctuary.” So they began with the old men who were in front of the temple."
"21863","Ezekiel","9","7","Then he said to them, “Defile the temple and fill the courts with the slain. Go!” So they went out and began killing throughout the city. "
"21864","Ezekiel","9","8","While they were killing and I was left alone, I fell facedown, crying out, “Alas, Sovereign Lord! Are you going to destroy the entire remnant of Israel in this outpouring of your wrath on Jerusalem?”"
"21865","Ezekiel","9","9","He answered me, “The sin of the people of Israel and Judah is exceedingly great; the land is full of bloodshed and the city is full of injustice. They say, ‘The Lord has forsaken the land; the Lord does not see.’ "
"21866","Ezekiel","9","10","So I will not look on them with pity or spare them, but I will bring down on their own heads what they have done.”"
"21867","Ezekiel","9","11","Then the man in linen with the writing kit at his side brought back word, saying, “I have done as you commanded.”"
"21868","Ezekiel","10","1","I looked, and I saw the likeness of a throne of lapis lazuli above the vault that was over the heads of the cherubim. "
"21869","Ezekiel","10","2","The Lord said to the man clothed in linen, “Go in among the wheels beneath the cherubim. Fill your hands with burning coals from among the cherubim and scatter them over the city.” And as I watched, he went in."
"21870","Ezekiel","10","3","Now the cherubim were standing on the south side of the temple when the man went in, and a cloud filled the inner court. "
"21871","Ezekiel","10","4","Then the glory of the Lord rose from above the cherubim and moved to the threshold of the temple. The cloud filled the temple, and the court was full of the radiance of the glory of the Lord. "
"21872","Ezekiel","10","5","The sound of the wings of the cherubim could be heard as far away as the outer court, like the voice of God Almighty10:5 Hebrew El-Shaddai when he speaks."
"21873","Ezekiel","10","6","When the Lord commanded the man in linen, “Take fire from among the wheels, from among the cherubim,” the man went in and stood beside a wheel. "
"21874","Ezekiel","10","7","Then one of the cherubim reached out his hand to the fire that was among them. He took up some of it and put it into the hands of the man in linen, who took it and went out. 8(Under the wings of the cherubim could be seen what looked like human hands.)"
"21875","Ezekiel","10","9","I looked, and I saw beside the cherubim four wheels, one beside each of the cherubim; the wheels sparkled like topaz. "
"21876","Ezekiel","10","10","As for their appearance, the four of them looked alike; each was like a wheel intersecting a wheel. "
"21877","Ezekiel","10","11","As they moved, they would go in any one of the four directions the cherubim faced; the wheels did not turn about10:11 Or aside as the cherubim went. The cherubim went in whatever direction the head faced, without turning as they went. "
"21878","Ezekiel","10","12","Their entire bodies, including their backs, their hands and their wings, were completely full of eyes, as were their four wheels. "
"21879","Ezekiel","10","13","I heard the wheels being called “the whirling wheels.” "
"21880","Ezekiel","10","14","Each of the cherubim had four faces: One face was that of a cherub, the second the face of a human being, the third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle."
"21881","Ezekiel","10","15","Then the cherubim rose upward. These were the living creatures I had seen by the Kebar River. "
"21882","Ezekiel","10","16","When the cherubim moved, the wheels beside them moved; and when the cherubim spread their wings to rise from the ground, the wheels did not leave their side. "
"21883","Ezekiel","10","17","When the cherubim stood still, they also stood still; and when the cherubim rose, they rose with them, because the spirit of the living creatures was in them."
"21884","Ezekiel","10","18","Then the glory of the Lord departed from over the threshold of the temple and stopped above the cherubim. "
"21885","Ezekiel","10","19","While I watched, the cherubim spread their wings and rose from the ground, and as they went, the wheels went with them. They stopped at the entrance of the east gate of the Lord’s house, and the glory of the God of Israel was above them."
"21886","Ezekiel","10","20","These were the living creatures I had seen beneath the God of Israel by the Kebar River, and I realized that they were cherubim. "
"21887","Ezekiel","10","21","Each had four faces and four wings, and under their wings was what looked like human hands. "
"21888","Ezekiel","10","22","Their faces had the same appearance as those I had seen by the Kebar River. Each one went straight ahead."
"21889","Ezekiel","11","1","Then the Spirit lifted me up and brought me to the gate of the house of the Lord that faces east. There at the entrance of the gate were twenty-five men, and I saw among them Jaazaniah son of Azzur and Pelatiah son of Benaiah, leaders of the people. "
"21890","Ezekiel","11","2","The Lord said to me, “Son of man, these are the men who are plotting evil and giving wicked advice in this city. "

"22719","Ezekiel","40","29","Its alcoves, its projecting walls and its portico had the same measurements as the others. The gateway and its portico had openings all around. It was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide. 30(The porticoes of the gateways around the inner court were twenty-five cubits wide and five cubits deep.) "

"22727","Ezekiel","40","38","A room with a doorway was by the portico in each of the inner gateways, where the burnt offerings were washed. "
"22728","Ezekiel","40","39","In the portico of the gateway were two tables on each side, on which the burnt offerings, sin offerings40:39 Or purification offerings and guilt offerings were slaughtered. "
"22729","Ezekiel","40","40","By the outside wall of the portico of the gateway, near the steps at the entrance of the north gateway were two tables, and on the other side of the steps were two tables. "
"22730","Ezekiel","40","41","So there were four tables on one side of the gateway and four on the other—eight tables in all—on which the sacrifices were slaughtered. "
"22731","Ezekiel","40","42","There were also four tables of dressed stone for the burnt offerings, each a cubit and a half long, a cubit and a half wide and a cubit high.40:42 That is, about 2 2/3 feet long and wide and 21 inches high or about 80 centimeters long and wide and 53 centimeters high On them were placed the utensils for slaughtering the burnt offerings and the other sacrifices.

"22737","Ezekiel","40","48","He brought me to the portico of the temple and measured the jambs of the portico; they were five cubits wide on either side. The width of the entrance was fourteen cubits40:48 That is, about 25 feet or about 7.4 meters and its projecting walls were40:48 Septuagint; Hebrew entrance was three cubits40:48 That is, about 5 1/4 feet or about 1.6 meters wide on either side.

He also measured the main hall; it was forty cubits long and twenty cubits wide.41:2 That is, about 70 feet long and 35 feet wide or about 21 meters long and 11 meters wide"
"22741","Ezekiel","41","3","Then he went into the inner sanctuary and measured the jambs of the entrance; each was two cubits41:3 That is, about 3 1/2 feet or about 1.1 meters; also in verse 22 wide. The entrance was six cubits wide, and the projecting walls on each side of it were seven cubits41:3 That is, about 12 feet or about 3.7 meters wide. "
"22742","Ezekiel","41","4","And he measured the length of the inner sanctuary; it was twenty cubits, and its width was twenty cubits across the end of the main hall. He said to me, “This is the Most Holy Place.”"
"22743","Ezekiel","41","5","Then he measured the wall of the temple; it was six cubits thick, and each side room around the temple was four cubits41:5 That is, about 7 feet or about 2.1 meters wide. "
"22744","Ezekiel","41","6","The side rooms were on three levels, one above another, thirty on each level. There were ledges all around the wall of the temple to serve as supports for the side rooms, so that the supports were not inserted into the wall of the temple. "
"22745","Ezekiel","41","7","The side rooms all around the temple were wider at each successive level. The structure surrounding the temple was built in ascending stages, so that the rooms widened as one went upward. A stairway went up from the lowest floor to the top floor through the middle floor."
"22746","Ezekiel","41","8","I saw that the temple had a raised base all around it, forming the foundation of the side rooms. It was the length of the rod, six long cubits. "
"22747","Ezekiel","41","9","The outer wall of the side rooms was five cubits thick. The open area between the side rooms of the temple "

"22752","Ezekiel","41","14","The width of the temple courtyard on the east, including the front of the temple, was a hundred cubits."
"22753","Ezekiel","41","15","Then he measured the length of the building facing the courtyard at the rear of the temple, including its galleries on each side; it was a hundred cubits.The main hall, the inner sanctuary and the portico facing the court, "
"22754","Ezekiel","41","16","as well as the thresholds and the narrow windows and galleries around the three of them—everything beyond and including the threshold was covered with wood. The floor, the wall up to the windows, and the windows were covered. "
"22755","Ezekiel","41","17","In the space above the outside of the entrance to the inner sanctuary and on the walls at regular intervals all around the inner and outer sanctuary "
"22756","Ezekiel","41","18","were carved cherubim and palm trees. Palm trees alternated with cherubim. Each cherub had two faces: "
"22757","Ezekiel","41","19","the face of a human being toward the palm tree on one side and the face of a lion toward the palm tree on the other. They were carved all around the whole temple. "
"22758","Ezekiel","41","20","From the floor to the area above the entrance, cherubim and palm trees were carved on the wall of the main hall."
"22759","Ezekiel","41","21","The main hall had a rectangular doorframe, and the one at the front of the Most Holy Place was similar. "
"22760","Ezekiel","41","22","There was a wooden altar three cubits41:22 That is, about 5 1/4 feet or about 1.5 meters high and two cubits square41:22 Septuagint; Hebrew long; its corners, its base41:22 Septuagint; Hebrew length and its sides were of wood. The man said to me, “This is the table that is before the Lord.” "
"22761","Ezekiel","41","23","Both the main hall and the Most Holy Place had double doors. "
"22762","Ezekiel","41","24","Each door had two leaves—two hinged leaves for each door. "
"22763","Ezekiel","41","25","And on the doors of the main hall were carved cherubim and palm trees like those carved on the walls, and there was a wooden overhang on the front of the portico. "
"22764","Ezekiel","41","26","On the sidewalls of the portico were narrow windows with palm trees carved on each side. The side rooms of the temple also had overhangs."
"22765","Ezekiel","42","1","Then the man led me northward into the outer court and brought me to the rooms opposite the temple courtyard and opposite the outer wall on the north side. "
"22766","Ezekiel","42","2","The building whose door faced north was a hundred cubits long and fifty cubits wide.42:2 That is, about 175 feet long and 88 feet wide or about 53 meters long and 27 meters wide "
"22767","Ezekiel","42","3","Both in the section twenty cubits42:3 That is, about 35 feet or about 11 meters from the inner court and in the section opposite the pavement of the outer court, gallery faced gallery at the three levels. "
"22768","Ezekiel","42","4","In front of the rooms was an inner passageway ten cubits wide and a hundred cubits42:4 Septuagint and Syriac; Hebrew and one cubit long.42:4 That is, about 18 feet wide and 175 feet long or about 5.3 meters wide and 53 meters long Their doors were on the north. "
"22769","Ezekiel","42","5","Now the upper rooms were narrower, for the galleries took more space from them than from the rooms on the lower and middle floors of the building. "
"22770","Ezekiel","42","6","The rooms on the top floor had no pillars, as the courts had; so they were smaller in floor space than those on the lower and middle floors. "
"22771","Ezekiel","42","7","There was an outer wall parallel to the rooms and the outer court; it extended in front of the rooms for fifty cubits. "
"22772","Ezekiel","42","8","While the row of rooms on the side next to the outer court was fifty cubits long, the row on the side nearest the sanctuary was a hundred cubits long. "
"22773","Ezekiel","42","9","The lower rooms had an entrance on the east side as one enters them from the outer court."
"22774","Ezekiel","42","10","On the south side42:10 Septuagint; Hebrew Eastward along the length of the wall of the outer court, adjoining the temple courtyard and opposite the outer wall, were rooms "
"22775","Ezekiel","42","11","with a passageway in front of them. These were like the rooms on the north; they had the same length and width, with similar exits and dimensions. Similar to the doorways on the north "
"22776","Ezekiel","42","12","were the doorways of the rooms on the south. There was a doorway at the beginning of the passageway that was parallel to the corresponding wall extending eastward, by which one enters the rooms."
"22777","Ezekiel","42","13","Then he said to me, “The north and south rooms facing the temple courtyard are the priests’ rooms, where the priests who approach the Lord will eat the most holy offerings. There they will put the most holy offerings—the grain offerings, the sin offerings42:13 Or purification offerings and the guilt offerings—for the place is holy. "
"22778","Ezekiel","42","14","Once the priests enter the holy precincts, they are not to go into the outer court until they leave behind the garments in which they minister, for these are holy. They are to put on other clothes before they go near the places that are for the people.”"
"22779","Ezekiel","42","15","When he had finished measuring what was inside the temple area, he led me out by the east gate and measured the area all around: "
"22780","Ezekiel","42","16","He measured the east side with the measuring rod; it was five hundred cubits.42:16 See Septuagint of verse 17; Hebrew rods; also in verses 18 and 19.42:16 Five hundred cubits equal about 875 feet or about 265 meters; also in verses 17, 18 and 19. "
"22781","Ezekiel","42","17","He measured the north side; it was five hundred cubits42:17 Septuagint; Hebrew rods by the measuring rod. "
"22782","Ezekiel","42","18","He measured the south side; it was five hundred cubits by the measuring rod. "
"22783","Ezekiel","42","19","Then he turned to the west side and measured; it was five hundred cubits by the measuring rod. "
"22784","Ezekiel","42","20","So he measured the area on all four sides. It had a wall around it, five hundred cubits long and five hundred cubits wide, to separate the holy from the common."
"22785","Ezekiel","43","1","Then the man brought me to the gate facing east, "
"22786","Ezekiel","43","2","and I saw the glory of the God of Israel coming from the east. His voice was like the roar of rushing waters, and the land was radiant with his glory. "
"22787","Ezekiel","43","3","The vision I saw was like the vision I had seen when he43:3 Some Hebrew manuscripts and Vulgate; most Hebrew manuscripts I came to destroy the city and like the visions I had seen by the Kebar River, and I fell facedown. "
"22788","Ezekiel","43","4","The glory of the Lord entered the temple through the gate facing east. "
"22789","Ezekiel","43","5","Then the Spirit lifted me up and brought me into the inner court, and the glory of the Lord filled the temple."

"22791","Ezekiel","43","7","He said: “Son of man, this is the place of my throne and the place for the soles of my feet. This is where I will live among the Israelites forever.

"22792","Ezekiel","43","8","When they placed their threshold next to my threshold and their doorposts beside my doorposts, with only a wall between me and them, they defiled my holy name by their detestable practices. So I destroyed them in my anger. "

"22926","Daniel","1","7","The chief official gave them new names: to Daniel, the name Belteshazzar; to Hananiah, Shadrach; to Mishael, Meshach; and to Azariah, Abednego."
"22927","Daniel","1","8","But Daniel resolved not to defile himself with the royal food and wine, and he asked the chief official for permission not to defile himself this way. "

"22932","Daniel","1","13","Then compare our appearance with that of the young men who eat the royal food, and treat your servants in accordance with what you see.” "
"22933","Daniel","1","14","So he agreed to this and tested them for ten days."
"22934","Daniel","1","15","At the end of the ten days they looked healthier and better nourished than any of the young men who ate the royal food. "
"22935","Daniel","1","16","So the guard took away their choice food and the wine they were to drink and gave them vegetables instead."
"22936","Daniel","1","17","To these four young men God gave knowledge and understanding of all kinds of literature and learning. And Daniel could understand visions and dreams of all kinds."

"22941","Daniel","2","1","In the second year of his reign, Nebuchadnezzar had dreams; his mind was troubled and he could not sleep. "
"22942","Daniel","2","2","So the king summoned the magicians, enchanters, sorcerers and astrologers2:2 Or Chaldeans; also in verses 4, 5 and 10 to tell him what he had dreamed. When they came in and stood before the king, "
"22943","Daniel","2","3","he said to them, “I have had a dream that troubles me and I want to know what it means.2:3 Or was”"
"22944","Daniel","2","4","Then the astrologers answered the king,2:4 At this point the Hebrew text has in Aramaic, indicating that the text from here through the end of chapter 7 is in Aramaic. “May the king live forever! Tell your servants the dream, and we will interpret it.”"
"22945","Daniel","2","5","The king replied to the astrologers, “This is what I have firmly decided: If you do not tell me what my dream was and interpret it, I will have you cut into pieces and your houses turned into piles of rubble. "
"22946","Daniel","2","6","But if you tell me the dream and explain it, you will receive from me gifts and rewards and great honor. So tell me the dream and interpret it for me.”"
"22947","Daniel","2","7","Once more they replied, “Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will interpret it.”"
"22948","Daniel","2","8","Then the king answered, “I am certain that you are trying to gain time, because you realize that this is what I have firmly decided: "
"22949","Daniel","2","9","If you do not tell me the dream, there is only one penalty for you. You have conspired to tell me misleading and wicked things, hoping the situation will change. So then, tell me the dream, and I will know that you can interpret it for me.”"
"22950","Daniel","2","10","The astrologers answered the king, “There is no one on earth who can do what the king asks! No king, however great and mighty, has ever asked such a thing of any magician or enchanter or astrologer. "
"22951","Daniel","2","11","What the king asks is too difficult. No one can reveal it to the king except the gods, and they do not live among humans.”"
"22952","Daniel","2","12","This made the king so angry and furious that he ordered the execution of all the wise men of Babylon. "
"22953","Daniel","2","13","So the decree was issued to put the wise men to death, and men were sent to look for Daniel and his friends to put them to death."
"22954","Daniel","2","14","When Arioch, the commander of the king’s guard, had gone out to put to death the wise men of Babylon, Daniel spoke to him with wisdom and tact. "
"22955","Daniel","2","15","He asked the king’s officer, “Why did the king issue such a harsh decree?” Arioch then explained the matter to Daniel. "
"22956","Daniel","2","16","At this, Daniel went in to the king and asked for time, so that he might interpret the dream for him."
"22957","Daniel","2","17","Then Daniel returned to his house and explained the matter to his friends Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah. "
"22958","Daniel","2","18","He urged them to plead for mercy from the God of heaven concerning this mystery, so that he and his friends might not be executed with the rest of the wise men of Babylon. "
"22959","Daniel","2","19","During the night the mystery was revealed to Daniel in a vision. Then Daniel praised the God of heaven "

"22964","Daniel","2","24","Then Daniel went to Arioch, whom the king had appointed to execute the wise men of Babylon, and said to him, “Do not execute the wise men of Babylon. Take me to the king, and I will interpret his dream for him.”"
"22965","Daniel","2","25","Arioch took Daniel to the king at once and said, “I have found a man among the exiles from Judah who can tell the king what his dream means.”"
"22966","Daniel","2","26","The king asked Daniel (also called Belteshazzar), “Are you able to tell me what I saw in my dream and interpret it?”"
"22967","Daniel","2","27","Daniel replied, “No wise man, enchanter, magician or diviner can explain to the king the mystery he has asked about, "
"22968","Daniel","2","28","but there is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries. He has shown King Nebuchadnezzar what will happen in days to come. Your dream and the visions that passed through your mind as you were lying in bed are these: "
"22969","Daniel","2","29","""As Your Majesty was lying there, your mind turned to things to come, and the revealer of mysteries showed you what is going to happen. "
"22970","Daniel","2","30","As for me, this mystery has been revealed to me, not because I have greater wisdom than anyone else alive, but so that Your Majesty may know the interpretation and that you may understand what went through your mind. "
"22971","Daniel","2","31","""Your Majesty looked, and there before you stood a large statue—an enormous, dazzling statue, awesome in appearance. "
"22972","Daniel","2","32","The head of the statue was made of pure gold, its chest and arms of silver, its belly and thighs of bronze, "
"22973","Daniel","2","33","its legs of iron, its feet partly of iron and partly of baked clay. "
"22974","Daniel","2","34","While you were watching, a rock was cut out, but not by human hands. It struck the statue on its feet of iron and clay and smashed them. "
"22975","Daniel","2","35","Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver and the gold were all broken to pieces and became like chaff on a threshing floor in the summer. The wind swept them away without leaving a trace. But the rock that struck the statue became a huge mountain and filled the whole earth. "
"22976","Daniel","2","36","""This was the dream, and now we will interpret it to the king. "
"22977","Daniel","2","37","Your Majesty, you are the king of kings. The God of heaven has given you dominion and power and might and glory; "
"22978","Daniel","2","38","in your hands he has placed all mankind and the beasts of the field and the birds in the sky. Wherever they live, he has made you ruler over them all. You are that head of gold. "
"22979","Daniel","2","39","""After you, another kingdom will arise, inferior to yours. Next, a third kingdom, one of bronze, will rule over the whole earth. "
"22980","Daniel","2","40","Finally, there will be a fourth kingdom, strong as iron—for iron breaks and smashes everything—and as iron breaks things to pieces, so it will crush and break all the others. "
"22981","Daniel","2","41","Just as you saw that the feet and toes were partly of baked clay and partly of iron, so this will be a divided kingdom; yet it will have some of the strength of iron in it, even as you saw iron mixed with clay. "
"22982","Daniel","2","42","As the toes were partly iron and partly clay, so this kingdom will be partly strong and partly brittle. "
"22983","Daniel","2","43","And just as you saw the iron mixed with baked clay, so the people will be a mixture and will not remain united, any more than iron mixes with clay. "
"22984","Daniel","2","44","""In the time of those kings, the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed, nor will it be left to another people. It will crush all those kingdoms and bring them to an end, but it will itself endure forever. "
"22985","Daniel","2","45","This is the meaning of the vision of the rock cut out of a mountain, but not by human hands—a rock that broke the iron, the bronze, the clay, the silver and the gold to pieces.“The great God has shown the king what will take place in the future. The dream is true and its interpretation is trustworthy.”"
"22986","Daniel","2","46","Then King Nebuchadnezzar fell prostrate before Daniel and paid him honor and ordered that an offering and incense be presented to him. "
"22987","Daniel","2","47","The king said to Daniel, “Surely your God is the God of gods and the Lord of kings and a revealer of mysteries, for you were able to reveal this mystery.”"
"22988","Daniel","2","48","Then the king placed Daniel in a high position and lavished many gifts on him. He made him ruler over the entire province of Babylon and placed him in charge of all its wise men. "
"22989","Daniel","2","49","Moreover, at Daniel’s request the king appointed Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego administrators over the province of Babylon, while Daniel himself remained at the royal court."
"22990","Daniel","3","1","King Nebuchadnezzar made an image of gold, sixty cubits high and six cubits wide,3:1 That is, about 90 feet high and 9 feet wide or about 27 meters high and 2.7 meters wide and set it up on the plain of Dura in the province of Babylon. "
"22991","Daniel","3","2","He then summoned the satraps, prefects, governors, advisers, treasurers, judges, magistrates and all the other provincial officials to come to the dedication of the image he had set up. "
"22992","Daniel","3","3","So the satraps, prefects, governors, advisers, treasurers, judges, magistrates and all the other provincial officials assembled for the dedication of the image that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up, and they stood before it."
"22993","Daniel","3","4","Then the herald loudly proclaimed, “Nations and peoples of every language, this is what you are commanded to do: "
"22994","Daniel","3","5","As soon as you hear the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipe and all kinds of music, you must fall down and worship the image of gold that King Nebuchadnezzar has set up. "
"22995","Daniel","3","6","Whoever does not fall down and worship will immediately be thrown into a blazing furnace.”"
"22996","Daniel","3","7","Therefore, as soon as they heard the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp and all kinds of music, all the nations and peoples of every language fell down and worshiped the image of gold that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up."
"22997","Daniel","3","8","At this time some astrologers3:8 Or Chaldeans came forward and denounced the Jews. "
"22998","Daniel","3","9","They said to King Nebuchadnezzar, “May the king live forever! "
"22999","Daniel","3","10","Your Majesty has issued a decree that everyone who hears the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipe and all kinds of music must fall down and worship the image of gold, "
"23000","Daniel","3","11","and that whoever does not fall down and worship will be thrown into a blazing furnace. "
"23001","Daniel","3","12","But there are some Jews whom you have set over the affairs of the province of Babylon—Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego—who pay no attention to you, Your Majesty. They neither serve your gods nor worship the image of gold you have set up.”"
"23002","Daniel","3","13","Furious with rage, Nebuchadnezzar summoned Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego. So these men were brought before the king, "
"23003","Daniel","3","14","and Nebuchadnezzar said to them, “Is it true, Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, that you do not serve my gods or worship the image of gold I have set up? "
"23004","Daniel","3","15","Now when you hear the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipe and all kinds of music, if you are ready to fall down and worship the image I made, very good. But if you do not worship it, you will be thrown immediately into a blazing furnace. Then what god will be able to rescue you from my hand?”"
"23005","Daniel","3","16","Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego replied to him, “King Nebuchadnezzar, we do not need to defend ourselves before you in this matter. "
"23006","Daniel","3","17","If we are thrown into the blazing furnace, the God we serve is able to deliver us from it, and he will deliver us3:17 Or If the God we serve is able to deliver us, then he will deliver us from the blazing furnace and from Your Majesty’s hand. "
"23007","Daniel","3","18","But even if he does not, we want you to know, Your Majesty, that we will not serve your gods or worship the image of gold you have set up.”"
"23008","Daniel","3","19","Then Nebuchadnezzar was furious with Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, and his attitude toward them changed. He ordered the furnace heated seven times hotter than usual "
"23009","Daniel","3","20","and commanded some of the strongest soldiers in his army to tie up Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego and throw them into the blazing furnace. "
"23010","Daniel","3","21","So these men, wearing their robes, trousers, turbans and other clothes, were bound and thrown into the blazing furnace. "
"23011","Daniel","3","22","The king’s command was so urgent and the furnace so hot that the flames of the fire killed the soldiers who took up Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, "
"23012","Daniel","3","23","and these three men, firmly tied, fell into the blazing furnace."
"23013","Daniel","3","24","Then King Nebuchadnezzar leaped to his feet in amazement and asked his advisers, “Weren’t there three men that we tied up and threw into the fire?”They replied, “Certainly, Your Majesty.”"
"23014","Daniel","3","25","He said, “Look! I see four men walking around in the fire, unbound and unharmed, and the fourth looks like a son of the gods.”"
"23015","Daniel","3","26","Nebuchadnezzar then approached the opening of the blazing furnace and shouted, “Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, servants of the Most High God, come out! Come here!”So Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego came out of the fire, "
"23016","Daniel","3","27","and the satraps, prefects, governors and royal advisers crowded around them. They saw that the fire had not harmed their bodies, nor was a hair of their heads singed; their robes were not scorched, and there was no smell of fire on them."
"23017","Daniel","3","28","Then Nebuchadnezzar said, “Praise be to the God of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, who has sent his angel and rescued his servants! They trusted in him and defied the king’s command and were willing to give up their lives rather than serve or worship any god except their own God. "
"23018","Daniel","3","29","Therefore I decree that the people of any nation or language who say anything against the God of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego be cut into pieces and their houses be turned into piles of rubble, for no other god can save in this way.”"
"23019","Daniel","3","30","Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego in the province of Babylon."
"23020","Daniel","4","1","King Nebuchadnezzar,To the nations and peoples of every language, who live in all the earth:May you prosper greatly!"
"23021","Daniel","4","2","It is my pleasure to tell you about the miraculous signs and wonders that the Most High God has performed for me."
"23022","Daniel","4","3","How great are his signs,how mighty his wonders!His kingdom is an eternal kingdom;his dominion endures from generation to generation."
"23023","Daniel","4","4","I, Nebuchadnezzar, was at home in my palace, contented and prosperous. "
"23024","Daniel","4","5","I had a dream that made me afraid. As I was lying in bed, the images and visions that passed through my mind terrified me. "
"23025","Daniel","4","6","So I commanded that all the wise men of Babylon be brought before me to interpret the dream for me. "
"23026","Daniel","4","7","When the magicians, enchanters, astrologers4:7 Or Chaldeans and diviners came, I told them the dream, but they could not interpret it for me. "
"23027","Daniel","4","8","Finally, Daniel came into my presence and I told him the dream. (He is called Belteshazzar, after the name of my god, and the spirit of the holy gods is in him.)"
"23028","Daniel","4","9","I said, “Belteshazzar, chief of the magicians, I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in you, and no mystery is too difficult for you. Here is my dream; interpret it for me. "
"23029","Daniel","4","10","These are the visions I saw while lying in bed: I looked, and there before me stood a tree in the middle of the land. Its height was enormous. "
"23030","Daniel","4","11","The tree grew large and strong and its top touched the sky; it was visible to the ends of the earth. "
"23031","Daniel","4","12","Its leaves were beautiful, its fruit abundant, and on it was food for all. Under it the wild animals found shelter, and the birds lived in its branches; from it every creature was fed. "
"23032","Daniel","4","13","""In the visions I saw while lying in bed, I looked, and there before me was a holy one, a messenger,4:13 Or watchman; also in verses 17 and 23 coming down from heaven. "
"23033","Daniel","4","14","He called in a loud voice: ‘Cut down the tree and trim off its branches; strip off its leaves and scatter its fruit. Let the animals flee from under it and the birds from its branches. "
"23034","Daniel","4","15","But let the stump and its roots, bound with iron and bronze, remain in the ground, in the grass of the field.“ ‘Let him be drenched with the dew of heaven, and let him live with the animals among the plants of the earth. "
"23035","Daniel","4","16","Let his mind be changed from that of a man and let him be given the mind of an animal, till seven times4:16 Or years; also in verses 23, 25 and 32 pass by for him. "
"23036","Daniel","4","17",""" ‘The decision is announced by messengers, the holy ones declare the verdict, so that the living may know that the Most High is sovereign over all kingdoms on earth and gives them to anyone he wishes and sets over them the lowliest of people.’ "
"23037","Daniel","4","18","""This is the dream that I, King Nebuchadnezzar, had. Now, Belteshazzar, tell me what it means, for none of the wise men in my kingdom can interpret it for me. But you can, because the spirit of the holy gods is in you.”Daniel Interprets the Dream"
"23038","Daniel","4","19","Then Daniel (also called Belteshazzar) was greatly perplexed for a time, and his thoughts terrified him. So the king said, “Belteshazzar, do not let the dream or its meaning alarm you.”Belteshazzar answered, “My lord, if only the dream applied to your enemies and its meaning to your adversaries! "
"23039","Daniel","4","20","The tree you saw, which grew large and strong, with its top touching the sky, visible to the whole earth, "
"23040","Daniel","4","21","with beautiful leaves and abundant fruit, providing food for all, giving shelter to the wild animals, and having nesting places in its branches for the birds— "
"23041","Daniel","4","22","Your Majesty, you are that tree! You have become great and strong; your greatness has grown until it reaches the sky, and your dominion extends to distant parts of the earth. "
"23042","Daniel","4","23","""Your Majesty saw a holy one, a messenger, coming down from heaven and saying, ‘Cut down the tree and destroy it, but leave the stump, bound with iron and bronze, in the grass of the field, while its roots remain in the ground. Let him be drenched with the dew of heaven; let him live with the wild animals, until seven times pass by for him.’ "
"23043","Daniel","4","24","""This is the interpretation, Your Majesty, and this is the decree the Most High has issued against my lord the king: "
"23044","Daniel","4","25","You will be driven away from people and will live with the wild animals; you will eat grass like the ox and be drenched with the dew of heaven. Seven times will pass by for you until you acknowledge that the Most High is sovereign over all kingdoms on earth and gives them to anyone he wishes. "
"23045","Daniel","4","26","The command to leave the stump of the tree with its roots means that your kingdom will be restored to you when you acknowledge that Heaven rules. "
"23046","Daniel","4","27","Therefore, Your Majesty, be pleased to accept my advice: Renounce your sins by doing what is right, and your wickedness by being kind to the oppressed. It may be that then your prosperity will continue.”The Dream Is Fulfilled"
"23047","Daniel","4","28","All this happened to King Nebuchadnezzar. "
"23048","Daniel","4","29","Twelve months later, as the king was walking on the roof of the royal palace of Babylon, "
"23049","Daniel","4","30","he said, “Is not this the great Babylon I have built as the royal residence, by my mighty power and for the glory of my majesty?”"
"23050","Daniel","4","31","Even as the words were on his lips, a voice came from heaven, “This is what is decreed for you, King Nebuchadnezzar: Your royal authority has been taken from you. "
"23051","Daniel","4","32","You will be driven away from people and will live with the wild animals; you will eat grass like the ox. Seven times will pass by for you until you acknowledge that the Most High is sovereign over all kingdoms on earth and gives them to anyone he wishes.”"
"23052","Daniel","4","33","Immediately what had been said about Nebuchadnezzar was fulfilled. He was driven away from people and ate grass like the ox. His body was drenched with the dew of heaven until his hair grew like the feathers of an eagle and his nails like the claws of a bird."
"23053","Daniel","4","34","At the end of that time, I, Nebuchadnezzar, raised my eyes toward heaven, and my sanity was restored. Then I praised the Most High; I honored and glorified him who lives forever.His dominion is an eternal dominion;his kingdom endures from generation to generation."
"23054","Daniel","4","35","All the peoples of the earthare regarded as nothing.He does as he pleaseswith the powers of heavenand the peoples of the earth.No one can hold back his handor say to him: “What have you done?”"
"23055","Daniel","4","36","At the same time that my sanity was restored, my honor and splendor were returned to me for the glory of my kingdom. My advisers and nobles sought me out, and I was restored to my throne and became even greater than before. "
"23056","Daniel","4","37","Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise and exalt and glorify the King of heaven, because everything he does is right and all his ways are just. And those who walk in pride he is able to humble."
"23057","Daniel","5","1","King Belshazzar gave a great banquet for a thousand of his nobles and drank wine with them. "
"23058","Daniel","5","2","While Belshazzar was drinking his wine, he gave orders to bring in the gold and silver goblets that Nebuchadnezzar his father5:2 Or ancestor; or predecessor; also in verses 11, 13 and 18 had taken from the temple in Jerusalem, so that the king and his nobles, his wives and his concubines might drink from them. "
"23059","Daniel","5","3","So they brought in the gold goblets that had been taken from the temple of God in Jerusalem, and the king and his nobles, his wives and his concubines drank from them. "
"23060","Daniel","5","4","As they drank the wine, they praised the gods of gold and silver, of bronze, iron, wood and stone."
"23061","Daniel","5","5","Suddenly the fingers of a human hand appeared and wrote on the plaster of the wall, near the lampstand in the royal palace. The king watched the hand as it wrote. "
"23062","Daniel","5","6","His face turned pale and he was so frightened that his legs became weak and his knees were knocking."
"23063","Daniel","5","7","The king summoned the enchanters, astrologers5:7 Or Chaldeans; also in verse 11 and diviners. Then he said to these wise men of Babylon, “Whoever reads this writing and tells me what it means will be clothed in purple and have a gold chain placed around his neck, and he will be made the third highest ruler in the kingdom.”"
"23064","Daniel","5","8","Then all the king’s wise men came in, but they could not read the writing or tell the king what it meant. "
"23065","Daniel","5","9","So King Belshazzar became even more terrified and his face grew more pale. His nobles were baffled."
"23066","Daniel","5","10","The queen,5:10 Or queen mother hearing the voices of the king and his nobles, came into the banquet hall. “May the king live forever!” she said. “Don’t be alarmed! Don’t look so pale! "
"23067","Daniel","5","11","There is a man in your kingdom who has the spirit of the holy gods in him. In the time of your father he was found to have insight and intelligence and wisdom like that of the gods. Your father, King Nebuchadnezzar, appointed him chief of the magicians, enchanters, astrologers and diviners. "
"23068","Daniel","5","12","He did this because Daniel, whom the king called Belteshazzar, was found to have a keen mind and knowledge and understanding, and also the ability to interpret dreams, explain riddles and solve difficult problems. Call for Daniel, and he will tell you what the writing means.”"
"23069","Daniel","5","13","So Daniel was brought before the king, and the king said to him, “Are you Daniel, one of the exiles my father the king brought from Judah? "
"23070","Daniel","5","14","I have heard that the spirit of the gods is in you and that you have insight, intelligence and outstanding wisdom. "
"23071","Daniel","5","15","The wise men and enchanters were brought before me to read this writing and tell me what it means, but they could not explain it. "
"23072","Daniel","5","16","Now I have heard that you are able to give interpretations and to solve difficult problems. If you can read this writing and tell me what it means, you will be clothed in purple and have a gold chain placed around your neck, and you will be made the third highest ruler in the kingdom.”"
"23073","Daniel","5","17","Then Daniel answered the king, “You may keep your gifts for yourself and give your rewards to someone else. Nevertheless, I will read the writing for the king and tell him what it means. "
"23074","Daniel","5","18","""Your Majesty, the Most High God gave your father Nebuchadnezzar sovereignty and greatness and glory and splendor. "
"23075","Daniel","5","19","Because of the high position he gave him, all the nations and peoples of every language dreaded and feared him. Those the king wanted to put to death, he put to death; those he wanted to spare, he spared; those he wanted to promote, he promoted; and those he wanted to humble, he humbled. "
"23076","Daniel","5","20","But when his heart became arrogant and hardened with pride, he was deposed from his royal throne and stripped of his glory. "
"23077","Daniel","5","21","He was driven away from people and given the mind of an animal; he lived with the wild donkeys and ate grass like the ox; and his body was drenched with the dew of heaven, until he acknowledged that the Most High God is sovereign over all kingdoms on earth and sets over them anyone he wishes. "
"23078","Daniel","5","22","""But you, Belshazzar, his son,5:22 Or descendant; or successor have not humbled yourself, though you knew all this. "
"23079","Daniel","5","23","Instead, you have set yourself up against the Lord of heaven. You had the goblets from his temple brought to you, and you and your nobles, your wives and your concubines drank wine from them. You praised the gods of silver and gold, of bronze, iron, wood and stone, which cannot see or hear or understand. But you did not honor the God who holds in his hand your life and all your ways. "
"23080","Daniel","5","24","Therefore he sent the hand that wrote the inscription. "
"23081","Daniel","5","25","""This is the inscription that was written:mene, mene, tekel, parsin "
"23082","Daniel","5","26","""Here is what these words mean:Mene5:26 Mene can mean numbered or mina (a unit of money).: God has numbered the days of your reign and brought it to an end."
"23083","Daniel","5","27","Tekel5:27 Tekel can mean weighed or shekel.: You have been weighed on the scales and found wanting."
"23084","Daniel","5","28","Peres5:28 Peres (the singular of Parsin) can mean divided or Persia or a half mina or a half shekel.: Your kingdom is divided and given to the Medes and Persians.”"
"23085","Daniel","5","29","Then at Belshazzar’s command, Daniel was clothed in purple, a gold chain was placed around his neck, and he was proclaimed the third highest ruler in the kingdom."
"23086","Daniel","5","30","That very night Belshazzar, king of the Babylonians,5:30 Or Chaldeans was slain, "
"23087","Daniel","5","31","and Darius the Mede took over the kingdom, at the age of sixty-two.5:31 In Aramaic texts this verse (5:31) is numbered 6:1."
"23088","Daniel","6","1","It pleased Darius to appoint 120 satraps to rule throughout the kingdom, "
"23089","Daniel","6","2","with three administrators over them, one of whom was Daniel. The satraps were made accountable to them so that the king might not suffer loss. "
"23090","Daniel","6","3","Now Daniel so distinguished himself among the administrators and the satraps by his exceptional qualities that the king planned to set him over the whole kingdom. "
"23091","Daniel","6","4","At this, the administrators and the satraps tried to find grounds for charges against Daniel in his conduct of government affairs, but they were unable to do so. They could find no corruption in him, because he was trustworthy and neither corrupt nor negligent. "
"23092","Daniel","6","5","Finally these men said, “We will never find any basis for charges against this man Daniel unless it has something to do with the law of his God.”"
"23093","Daniel","6","6","So these administrators and satraps went as a group to the king and said: “May King Darius live forever! "
"23094","Daniel","6","7","The royal administrators, prefects, satraps, advisers and governors have all agreed that the king should issue an edict and enforce the decree that anyone who prays to any god or human being during the next thirty days, except to you, Your Majesty, shall be thrown into the lions’ den. "
"23095","Daniel","6","8","Now, Your Majesty, issue the decree and put it in writing so that it cannot be altered—in accordance with the law of the Medes and Persians, which cannot be repealed.” "
"23096","Daniel","6","9","So King Darius put the decree in writing."
"23097","Daniel","6","10","Now when Daniel learned that the decree had been published, he went home to his upstairs room where the windows opened toward Jerusalem. Three times a day he got down on his knees and prayed, giving thanks to his God, just as he had done before. "
"23098","Daniel","6","11","Then these men went as a group and found Daniel praying and asking God for help. "
"23099","Daniel","6","12","So they went to the king and spoke to him about his royal decree: “Did you not publish a decree that during the next thirty days anyone who prays to any god or human being except to you, Your Majesty, would be thrown into the lions’ den?”The king answered, “The decree stands—in accordance with the law of the Medes and Persians, which cannot be repealed.”"
"23100","Daniel","6","13","Then they said to the king, “Daniel, who is one of the exiles from Judah, pays no attention to you, Your Majesty, or to the decree you put in writing. He still prays three times a day.” "
"23101","Daniel","6","14","When the king heard this, he was greatly distressed; he was determined to rescue Daniel and made every effort until sundown to save him."
"23102","Daniel","6","15","Then the men went as a group to King Darius and said to him, “Remember, Your Majesty, that according to the law of the Medes and Persians no decree or edict that the king issues can be changed.”"
"23103","Daniel","6","16","So the king gave the order, and they brought Daniel and threw him into the lions’ den. The king said to Daniel, “May your God, whom you serve continually, rescue you!”"
"23104","Daniel","6","17","A stone was brought and placed over the mouth of the den, and the king sealed it with his own signet ring and with the rings of his nobles, so that Daniel’s situation might not be changed. "
"23105","Daniel","6","18","Then the king returned to his palace and spent the night without eating and without any entertainment being brought to him. And he could not sleep."
"23106","Daniel","6","19","At the first light of dawn, the king got up and hurried to the lions’ den. "
"23107","Daniel","6","20","When he came near the den, he called to Daniel in an anguished voice, “Daniel, servant of the living God, has your God, whom you serve continually, been able to rescue you from the lions?”"
"23108","Daniel","6","21","Daniel answered, “May the king live forever! "
"23109","Daniel","6","22","My God sent his angel, and he shut the mouths of the lions. They have not hurt me, because I was found innocent in his sight. Nor have I ever done any wrong before you, Your Majesty.”"
"23110","Daniel","6","23","The king was overjoyed and gave orders to lift Daniel out of the den. And when Daniel was lifted from the den, no wound was found on him, because he had trusted in his God."
"23111","Daniel","6","24","At the king’s command, the men who had falsely accused Daniel were brought in and thrown into the lions’ den, along with their wives and children. And before they reached the floor of the den, the lions overpowered them and crushed all their bones."
"23112","Daniel","6","25","Then King Darius wrote to all the nations and peoples of every language in all the earth:“May you prosper greatly! "
"23113","Daniel","6","26","""I issue a decree that in every part of my kingdom people must fear and reverence the God of Daniel.“For he is the living Godand he endures forever;his kingdom will not be destroyed,his dominion will never end."
"23114","Daniel","6","27","He rescues and he saves;he performs signs and wondersin the heavens and on the earth.He has rescued Danielfrom the power of the lions.”"
"23115","Daniel","6","28","So Daniel prospered during the reign of Darius and the reign of Cyrus6:28 Or Darius, that is, the reign of Cyrus the Persian."
"23116","Daniel","7","1","In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon, Daniel had a dream, and visions passed through his mind as he was lying in bed. He wrote down the substance of his dream."
"23117","Daniel","7","2","Daniel said: “In my vision at night I looked, and there before me were the four winds of heaven churning up the great sea. "
"23118","Daniel","7","3","Four great beasts, each different from the others, came up out of the sea. "
"23119","Daniel","7","4","""The first was like a lion, and it had the wings of an eagle. I watched until its wings were torn off and it was lifted from the ground so that it stood on two feet like a human being, and the mind of a human was given to it. "
"23120","Daniel","7","5","""And there before me was a second beast, which looked like a bear. It was raised up on one of its sides, and it had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth. It was told, ‘Get up and eat your fill of flesh!’ "
"23121","Daniel","7","6","""After that, I looked, and there before me was another beast, one that looked like a leopard. And on its back it had four wings like those of a bird. This beast had four heads, and it was given authority to rule. "
"23122","Daniel","7","7","""After that, in my vision at night I looked, and there before me was a fourth beast—terrifying and frightening and very powerful. It had large iron teeth; it crushed and devoured its victims and trampled underfoot whatever was left. It was different from all the former beasts, and it had ten horns. "
"23123","Daniel","7","8","""While I was thinking about the horns, there before me was another horn, a little one, which came up among them; and three of the first horns were uprooted before it. This horn had eyes like the eyes of a human being and a mouth that spoke boastfully. "
"23124","Daniel","7","9","""As I looked,“thrones were set in place,and the Ancient of Days took his seat.His clothing was as white as snow;the hair of his head was white like wool.His throne was flaming with fire,and its wheels were all ablaze."
"23125","Daniel","7","10","A river of fire was flowing,coming out from before him.Thousands upon thousands attended him;ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him.The court was seated,and the books were opened. "
"23126","Daniel","7","11","""Then I continued to watch because of the boastful words the horn was speaking. I kept looking until the beast was slain and its body destroyed and thrown into the blazing fire. 12(The other beasts had been stripped of their authority, but were allowed to live for a period of time.) "
"23127","Daniel","7","13","""In my vision at night I looked, and there before me was one like a son of man,7:13 The Aramaic phrase bar enash means human being. The phrase son of man is retained here because of its use in the New Testament as a title of Jesus, probably based largely on this verse. coming with the clouds of heaven. He approached the Ancient of Days and was led into his presence. "
"23128","Daniel","7","14","He was given authority, glory and sovereign power; all nations and peoples of every language worshiped him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion that will not pass away, and his kingdom is one that will never be destroyed.The Interpretation of the Dream "
"23129","Daniel","7","15","""I, Daniel, was troubled in spirit, and the visions that passed through my mind disturbed me. "
"23130","Daniel","7","16","I approached one of those standing there and asked him the meaning of all this.“So he told me and gave me the interpretation of these things: 17‘The four great beasts are four kings that will rise from the earth. "
"23131","Daniel","7","18","But the holy people of the Most High will receive the kingdom and will possess it forever—yes, for ever and ever.’ "
"23132","Daniel","7","19","""Then I wanted to know the meaning of the fourth beast, which was different from all the others and most terrifying, with its iron teeth and bronze claws—the beast that crushed and devoured its victims and trampled underfoot whatever was left. "
"23133","Daniel","7","20","I also wanted to know about the ten horns on its head and about the other horn that came up, before which three of them fell—the horn that looked more imposing than the others and that had eyes and a mouth that spoke boastfully. "
"23134","Daniel","7","21","As I watched, this horn was waging war against the holy people and defeating them, "
"23135","Daniel","7","22","until the Ancient of Days came and pronounced judgment in favor of the holy people of the Most High, and the time came when they possessed the kingdom. "
"23136","Daniel","7","23","""He gave me this explanation: ‘The fourth beast is a fourth kingdom that will appear on earth. It will be different from all the other kingdoms and will devour the whole earth, trampling it down and crushing it. "
"23137","Daniel","7","24","The ten horns are ten kings who will come from this kingdom. After them another king will arise, different from the earlier ones; he will subdue three kings. "
"23138","Daniel","7","25","He will speak against the Most High and oppress his holy people and try to change the set times and the laws. The holy people will be delivered into his hands for a time, times and half a time.7:25 Or for a year, two years and half a year "
"23139","Daniel","7","26",""" ‘But the court will sit, and his power will be taken away and completely destroyed forever. "
"23140","Daniel","7","27","Then the sovereignty, power and greatness of all the kingdoms under heaven will be handed over to the holy people of the Most High. His kingdom will be an everlasting kingdom, and all rulers will worship and obey him.’ "
"23141","Daniel","7","28","""This is the end of the matter. I, Daniel, was deeply troubled by my thoughts, and my face turned pale, but I kept the matter to myself.”"
"23142","Daniel","8","1","In the third year of King Belshazzar’s reign, I, Daniel, had a vision, after the one that had already appeared to me. "
"23143","Daniel","8","2","In my vision I saw myself in the citadel of Susa in the province of Elam; in the vision I was beside the Ulai Canal. "
"23144","Daniel","8","3","I looked up, and there before me was a ram with two horns, standing beside the canal, and the horns were long. One of the horns was longer than the other but grew up later. "
"23145","Daniel","8","4","I watched the ram as it charged toward the west and the north and the south. No animal could stand against it, and none could rescue from its power. It did as it pleased and became great."
"23146","Daniel","8","5","As I was thinking about this, suddenly a goat with a prominent horn between its eyes came from the west, crossing the whole earth without touching the ground. "
"23147","Daniel","8","6","It came toward the two-horned ram I had seen standing beside the canal and charged at it in great rage. "
"23148","Daniel","8","7","I saw it attack the ram furiously, striking the ram and shattering its two horns. The ram was powerless to stand against it; the goat knocked it to the ground and trampled on it, and none could rescue the ram from its power. "
"23149","Daniel","8","8","The goat became very great, but at the height of its power the large horn was broken off, and in its place four prominent horns grew up toward the four winds of heaven."
"23150","Daniel","8","9","Out of one of them came another horn, which started small but grew in power to the south and to the east and toward the Beautiful Land. "
"23151","Daniel","8","10","It grew until it reached the host of the heavens, and it threw some of the starry host down to the earth and trampled on them. "
"23152","Daniel","8","11","It set itself up to be as great as the commander of the army of the Lord; it took away the daily sacrifice from the Lord, and his sanctuary was thrown down. "
"23153","Daniel","8","12","Because of rebellion, the Lord’s people8:12 Or rebellion, the armies and the daily sacrifice were given over to it. It prospered in everything it did, and truth was thrown to the ground."
"23154","Daniel","8","13","Then I heard a holy one speaking, and another holy one said to him, “How long will it take for the vision to be fulfilled—the vision concerning the daily sacrifice, the rebellion that causes desolation, the surrender of the sanctuary and the trampling underfoot of the Lord’s people?”"
"23155","Daniel","8","14","He said to me, “It will take 2,300 evenings and mornings; then the sanctuary will be reconsecrated.”The Interpretation of the Vision"
"23156","Daniel","8","15","While I, Daniel, was watching the vision and trying to understand it, there before me stood one who looked like a man. "
"23157","Daniel","8","16","And I heard a man’s voice from the Ulai calling, “Gabriel, tell this man the meaning of the vision.”"
"23158","Daniel","8","17","As he came near the place where I was standing, I was terrified and fell prostrate. “Son of man,”8:17 The Hebrew phrase ben adam means human being. The phrase son of man is retained as a form of address here because of its possible association with “Son of Man” in the New Testament. he said to me, “understand that the vision concerns the time of the end.”"
"23159","Daniel","8","18","While he was speaking to me, I was in a deep sleep, with my face to the ground. Then he touched me and raised me to my feet."
"23160","Daniel","8","19","He said: “I am going to tell you what will happen later in the time of wrath, because the vision concerns the appointed time of the end.8:19 Or because the end will be at the appointed time "
"23161","Daniel","8","20","The two-horned ram that you saw represents the kings of Media and Persia. "
"23162","Daniel","8","21","The shaggy goat is the king of Greece, and the large horn between its eyes is the first king. "
"23163","Daniel","8","22","The four horns that replaced the one that was broken off represent four kingdoms that will emerge from his nation but will not have the same power. "
"23164","Daniel","8","23","""In the latter part of their reign, when rebels have become completely wicked, a fierce-looking king, a master of intrigue, will arise. "
"23165","Daniel","8","24","He will become very strong, but not by his own power. He will cause astounding devastation and will succeed in whatever he does. He will destroy those who are mighty, the holy people. "
"23166","Daniel","8","25","He will cause deceit to prosper, and he will consider himself superior. When they feel secure, he will destroy many and take his stand against the Prince of princes. Yet he will be destroyed, but not by human power. "
"23167","Daniel","8","26","""The vision of the evenings and mornings that has been given you is true, but seal up the vision, for it concerns the distant future.”"
"23168","Daniel","8","27","I, Daniel, was worn out. I lay exhausted for several days. Then I got up and went about the king’s business. I was appalled by the vision; it was beyond understanding."
"23169","Daniel","9","1","In the first year of Darius son of Xerxes9:1 Hebrew Ahasuerus (a Mede by descent), who was made ruler over the Babylonian9:1 Or Chaldean kingdom— "
"23170","Daniel","9","2","in the first year of his reign, I, Daniel, understood from the Scriptures, according to the word of the Lord given to Jeremiah the prophet, that the desolation of Jerusalem would last seventy years. "
"23171","Daniel","9","3","So I turned to the Lord God and pleaded with him in prayer and petition, in fasting, and in sackcloth and ashes."
"23172","Daniel","9","4","I prayed to the Lord my God and confessed:“Lord, the great and awesome God, who keeps his covenant of love with those who love him and keep his commandments, "
"23173","Daniel","9","5","we have sinned and done wrong. We have been wicked and have rebelled; we have turned away from your commands and laws. "
"23174","Daniel","9","6","We have not listened to your servants the prophets, who spoke in your name to our kings, our princes and our ancestors, and to all the people of the land. "
"23175","Daniel","9","7","""Lord, you are righteous, but this day we are covered with shame—the people of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem and all Israel, both near and far, in all the countries where you have scattered us because of our unfaithfulness to you. "
"23176","Daniel","9","8","We and our kings, our princes and our ancestors are covered with shame, Lord, because we have sinned against you. "
"23177","Daniel","9","9","The Lord our God is merciful and forgiving, even though we have rebelled against him; "
"23178","Daniel","9","10","we have not obeyed the Lord our God or kept the laws he gave us through his servants the prophets. "
"23179","Daniel","9","11","All Israel has transgressed your law and turned away, refusing to obey you.“Therefore the curses and sworn judgments written in the Law of Moses, the servant of God, have been poured out on us, because we have sinned against you. "
"23180","Daniel","9","12","You have fulfilled the words spoken against us and against our rulers by bringing on us great disaster. Under the whole heaven nothing has ever been done like what has been done to Jerusalem. "
"23181","Daniel","9","13","Just as it is written in the Law of Moses, all this disaster has come on us, yet we have not sought the favor of the Lord our God by turning from our sins and giving attention to your truth. "
"23182","Daniel","9","14","The Lord did not hesitate to bring the disaster on us, for the Lord our God is righteous in everything he does; yet we have not obeyed him. "
"23183","Daniel","9","15","""Now, Lord our God, who brought your people out of Egypt with a mighty hand and who made for yourself a name that endures to this day, we have sinned, we have done wrong. "
"23184","Daniel","9","16","Lord, in keeping with all your righteous acts, turn away your anger and your wrath from Jerusalem, your city, your holy hill. Our sins and the iniquities of our ancestors have made Jerusalem and your people an object of scorn to all those around us. "
"23185","Daniel","9","17","""Now, our God, hear the prayers and petitions of your servant. For your sake, Lord, look with favor on your desolate sanctuary. "
"23186","Daniel","9","18","Give ear, our God, and hear; open your eyes and see the desolation of the city that bears your Name. We do not make requests of you because we are righteous, but because of your great mercy. "

"23188","Daniel","9","20","While I was speaking and praying, confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel and making my request to the Lord my God for his holy hill— "
"23189","Daniel","9","21","while I was still in prayer, Gabriel, the man I had seen in the earlier vision, came to me in swift flight about the time of the evening sacrifice. "
"23190","Daniel","9","22","He instructed me and said to me, “Daniel, I have now come to give you insight and understanding. "
"23191","Daniel","9","23","As soon as you began to pray, a word went out, which I have come to tell you, for you are highly esteemed. Therefore, consider the word and understand the vision: "

"23193","Daniel","9","25","""Know and understand this: From the time the word goes out to restore and rebuild Jerusalem until the Anointed One,9:25 Or an anointed one; also in verse 26 the ruler, comes, there will be seven ‘sevens,’ and sixty-two ‘sevens.’ It will be rebuilt with streets and a trench, but in times of trouble. "

The end will come like a flood: War will continue until the end, and desolations have been decreed. "
"23195","Daniel","9","27","He will confirm a covenant with many for one ‘seven.’9:27 Or ‘week’ In the middle of the ‘seven’9:27 Or ‘week’ he will put an end to sacrifice and offering.

"23197","Daniel","10","2","At that time I, Daniel, mourned for three weeks. "
"23198","Daniel","10","3","I ate no choice food; no meat or wine touched my lips; and I used no lotions at all until the three weeks were over."
"23199","Daniel","10","4","On the twenty-fourth day of the first month, as I was standing on the bank of the great river, the Tigris, "
"23200","Daniel","10","5","I looked up and there before me was a man dressed in linen, with a belt of fine gold from Uphaz around his waist. "
"23201","Daniel","10","6","His body was like topaz, his face like lightning, his eyes like flaming torches, his arms and legs like the gleam of burnished bronze, and his voice like the sound of a multitude."
"23202","Daniel","10","7","I, Daniel, was the only one who saw the vision; those who were with me did not see it, but such terror overwhelmed them that they fled and hid themselves. "
"23203","Daniel","10","8","So I was left alone, gazing at this great vision; I had no strength left, my face turned deathly pale and I was helpless. "
"23204","Daniel","10","9","Then I heard him speaking, and as I listened to him, I fell into a deep sleep, my face to the ground."
"23205","Daniel","10","10","A hand touched me and set me trembling on my hands and knees. "
"23206","Daniel","10","11","He said, “Daniel, you who are highly esteemed, consider carefully the words I am about to speak to you, and stand up, for I have now been sent to you.” And when he said this to me, I stood up trembling."
"23207","Daniel","10","12","Then he continued, “Do not be afraid, Daniel. Since the first day that you set your mind to gain understanding and to humble yourself before your God, your words were heard, and I have come in response to them. "
"23208","Daniel","10","13","But the prince of the Persian kingdom resisted me twenty-one days. Then Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me, because I was detained there with the king of Persia. "
"23209","Daniel","10","14","Now I have come to explain to you what will happen to your people in the future, for the vision concerns a time yet to come.”"
"23210","Daniel","10","15","While he was saying this to me, I bowed with my face toward the ground and was speechless. "
"23211","Daniel","10","16","Then one who looked like a man10:16 Most manuscripts of the Masoretic Text; one manuscript of the Masoretic Text, Dead Sea Scrolls and Septuagint Then something that looked like a human hand touched my lips, and I opened my mouth and began to speak.

"23212","Daniel","10","17","How can I, your servant, talk with you, my lord? My strength is gone and I can hardly breathe.”"
"23213","Daniel","10","18","Again the one who looked like a man touched me and gave me strength.  "

"23220","Daniel","11","4","After he has arisen, his empire will be broken up and parceled out toward the four winds of heaven. It will not go to his descendants, nor will it have the power he exercised, because his empire will be uprooted and given to others. "

"23225","Daniel","11","9","Then the king of the North will invade the realm of the king of the South but will retreat to his own country. "
"23226","Daniel","11","10","His sons will prepare for war and assemble a great army, which will sweep on like an irresistible flood and carry the battle as far as his fortress. "

"23228","Daniel","11","12","When the army is carried off, the king of the South will be filled with pride and will slaughter many thousands, yet he will not remain triumphant. "
"23229","Daniel","11","13","For the king of the North will muster another army, larger than the first; and after several years, he will advance with a huge army fully equipped. "
"23230","Daniel","11","14","""In those times many will rise against the king of the South. Those who are violent among your own people will rebel in fulfillment of the vision, but without success. "

"23907","Haggai","1","1","In the second year of King Darius, on the first day of the sixth month, the word of the Lord came through the prophet Haggai to Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua son of Jozadak, # 1:1 Hebrew Jehozadak, a variant of Jozadak; also in verses 12 and 14 1:1 Hebrew Jehozadak , a variant of Jozadak ; also in verses 12 and 14 the high priest: "

"23909","Haggai","1","3","Then the word of the Lord came through the prophet Haggai: "
"23910","Haggai","1","4","“Is it a time for you yourselves to be living in your paneled houses, while this house remains a ruin?” "
"23911","Haggai","1","5","Now this is what the Lord Almighty says: “Give careful thought to your ways. "
"23912","Haggai","1","6","You have planted much, but harvested little. You eat, but never have enough. You drink, but never have your fill. You put on clothes, but are not warm. You earn wages, only to put them in a purse with holes in it.” "
"23913","Haggai","1","7","This is what the Lord Almighty says: “Give careful thought to your ways. "
"23914","Haggai","1","8","Go up into the mountains and bring down timber and build my house, so that I may take pleasure in it and be honored,” says the Lord . "
"23915","Haggai","1","9","“You expected much, but see, it turned out to be little. What you brought home, I blew away. Why?” declares the Lord Almighty. “Because of my house, which remains a ruin, while each of you is busy with your own house. "
"23916","Haggai","1","10","Therefore, because of you the heavens have withheld their dew and the earth its crops. "
"23917","Haggai","1","11","I called for a drought on the fields and the mountains, on the grain, the new wine, the olive oil and everything else the ground produces, on people and livestock, and on all the labor of your hands.” "
"23918","Haggai","1","12","Then Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, Joshua son of Jozadak, the high priest, and the whole remnant of the people obeyed the voice of the Lord their God and the message of the prophet Haggai, because the Lord their God had sent him. And the people feared the Lord . "

"23930","Haggai","2","9","‘The glory of this present house will be greater than the glory of the former house,’ says the Lord Almighty. ‘And in this place I will grant peace,’ declares the Lord Almighty.” "
"23931","Haggai","2","10","On the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, in the second year of Darius, the word of the Lord came to the prophet Haggai: "

"23934","Haggai","2","13","Then Haggai said, “If a person defiled by contact with a dead body touches one of these things, does it become defiled?” “Yes,” the priests replied, “it becomes defiled.” "
"23935","Haggai","2","14","Then Haggai said, “ ‘So it is with this people and this nation in my sight,’ declares the Lord . ‘Whatever they do and whatever they offer there is defiled. "

"23939","Haggai","2","18","‘From this day on, from this twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, give careful thought to the day when the foundation of the Lord ’s temple was laid. Give careful thought: "

"23950","Zechariah","1","6","But did not my words and my decrees, which I commanded my servants the prophets, overtake your ancestors? “Then they repented and said, ‘The Lord Almighty has done to us what our ways and practices deserve, just as he determined to do.’ ” "
"23951","Zechariah","1","7","On the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, the month of Shebat, in the second year of Darius, the word of the Lord came to the prophet Zechariah son of Berekiah, the son of Iddo. "
"23952","Zechariah","1","8","During the night I had a vision, and there before me was a man mounted on a red horse. He was standing among the myrtle trees in a ravine. Behind him were red, brown and white horses. "
"23953","Zechariah","1","9","I asked, “What are these, my lord?” The angel who was talking with me answered, “I will show you what they are.” "
"23954","Zechariah","1","10","Then the man standing among the myrtle trees explained, “They are the ones the Lord has sent to go throughout the earth.” "
"23955","Zechariah","1","11","And they reported to the angel of the Lord who was standing among the myrtle trees, “We have gone throughout the earth and found the whole world at rest and in peace.” "
"23956","Zechariah","1","12","Then the angel of the Lord said, “ Lord Almighty, how long will you withhold mercy from Jerusalem and from the towns of Judah, which you have been angry with these seventy years?” "
"23957","Zechariah","1","13","So the Lord spoke kind and comforting words to the angel who talked with me. "
"23958","Zechariah","1","14","Then the angel who was speaking to me said, “Proclaim this word: This is what the Lord Almighty says: ‘I am very jealous for Jerusalem and Zion, "
"23959","Zechariah","1","15","and I am very angry with the nations that feel secure. I was only a little angry, but they went too far with the punishment.’ "
"23960","Zechariah","1","16","“Therefore this is what the Lord says: ‘I will return to Jerusalem with mercy, and there my house will be rebuilt. And the measuring line will be stretched out over Jerusalem,’ declares the Lord Almighty. "
"23961","Zechariah","1","17","“Proclaim further: This is what the Lord Almighty says: ‘My towns will again overflow with prosperity, and the Lord will again comfort Zion and choose Jerusalem.’ ” "
"23962","Zechariah","1","18","Then I looked up, and there before me were four horns. "
"23963","Zechariah","1","19","I asked the angel who was speaking to me, “What are these?” He answered me, “These are the horns that scattered Judah, Israel and Jerusalem.” "
"23964","Zechariah","1","20","Then the Lord showed me four craftsmen. "
"23965","Zechariah","1","21","I asked, “What are these coming to do?” He answered, “These are the horns that scattered Judah so that no one could raise their head, but the craftsmen have come to terrify them and throw down these horns of the nations who lifted up their horns against the land of Judah to scatter its people.” # 1:21 In Hebrew texts 1:18-21 is numbered 2:1-4. 1:21 In Hebrew texts 1:18-21 is numbered 2:1-4.

"23966","Zechariah","2","1","Then I looked up, and there before me was a man with a measuring line in his hand. "
"23967","Zechariah","2","2","I asked, “Where are you going?” He answered me, “To measure Jerusalem, to find out how wide and how long it is.” "
"23968","Zechariah","2","3","While the angel who was speaking to me was leaving, another angel came to meet him "
"23969","Zechariah","2","4","and said to him: “Run, tell that young man, ‘Jerusalem will be a city without walls because of the great number of people and animals in it. "
"23970","Zechariah","2","5","And I myself will be a wall of fire around it,’ declares the Lord , ‘and I will be its glory within.’ "
"23971","Zechariah","2","6","“Come! Come! Flee from the land of the north,” declares the Lord , “for I have scattered you to the four winds of heaven,” declares the Lord . "
"23972","Zechariah","2","7","“Come, Zion! Escape, you who live in Daughter Babylon!” "
"23973","Zechariah","2","8","For this is what the Lord Almighty says: “After the Glorious One has sent me against the nations that have plundered you—for whoever touches you touches the apple of his eye— "
"23974","Zechariah","2","9","I will surely raise my hand against them so that their slaves will plunder them. # 2:8,9 Or says after… eye: 9 “I… plunder them.” 2:8,9 Or says after… eye: "
"23975","Zechariah","2","9","“I… plunder them.” Then you will know that the Lord Almighty has sent me. "
"23976","Zechariah","2","10","“Shout and be glad, Daughter Zion. For I am coming, and I will live among you,” declares the Lord . "

"23978","Zechariah","2","12","The Lord will inherit Judah as his portion in the holy land and will again choose Jerusalem. "
"23979","Zechariah","2","13","Be still before the Lord , all mankind, because he has roused himself from his holy dwelling.” "
"23980","Zechariah","3","1","Then he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the Lord , and Satan # 3:1 Hebrew satan means adversary. 3:1 Hebrew satan means satan adversary. standing at his right side to accuse him. "
"23981","Zechariah","3","2","The Lord said to Satan, “The Lord rebuke you, Satan! The Lord , who has chosen Jerusalem, rebuke you! Is not this man a burning stick snatched from the fire?” "
"23982","Zechariah","3","3","Now Joshua was dressed in filthy clothes as he stood before the angel. "
"23983","Zechariah","3","4","The angel said to those who were standing before him, “Take off his filthy clothes.” Then he said to Joshua, “See, I have taken away your sin, and I will put fine garments on you.” "
"23984","Zechariah","3","5","Then I said, “Put a clean turban on his head.” So they put a clean turban on his head and clothed him, while the angel of the Lord stood by. "
"23985","Zechariah","3","6","The angel of the Lord gave this charge to Joshua: "
"23986","Zechariah","3","7","“This is what the Lord Almighty says: ‘If you will walk in obedience to me and keep my requirements, then you will govern my house and have charge of my courts, and I will give you a place among these standing here. "
"23987","Zechariah","3","8","“ ‘Listen, High Priest Joshua, you and your associates seated before you, who are men symbolic of things to come: I am going to bring my servant, the Branch. "
"23988","Zechariah","3","9","See, the stone I have set in front of Joshua! There are seven eyes # 3:9 Or facets 3:9 Or facets on that one stone, and I will engrave an inscription on it,’ says the Lord Almighty, ‘and I will remove the sin of this land in a single day. "
"23989","Zechariah","3","10","“ ‘In that day each of you will invite your neighbor to sit under your vine and fig tree,’ declares the Lord Almighty.” "
"23990","Zechariah","4","1","Then the angel who talked with me returned and woke me up, like someone awakened from sleep. "
"23991","Zechariah","4","2","He asked me, “What do you see?” I answered, “I see a solid gold lampstand with a bowl at the top and seven lamps on it, with seven channels to the lamps. "
"23992","Zechariah","4","3","Also there are two olive trees by it, one on the right of the bowl and the other on its left.” "
"23993","Zechariah","4","4","I asked the angel who talked with me, “What are these, my lord?” "
"23994","Zechariah","4","5","He answered, “Do you not know what these are?” “No, my lord,” I replied. "
"23995","Zechariah","4","6","So he said to me, “This is the word of the Lord to Zerubbabel: ‘Not by might nor by power, but by my Spirit,’ says the Lord Almighty. "
"23996","Zechariah","4","7","“What are you, mighty mountain? Before Zerubbabel you will become level ground. Then he will bring out the capstone to shouts of ‘God bless it! God bless it!’ ” "
"23997","Zechariah","4","8","Then the word of the Lord came to me: "
"23998","Zechariah","4","9","“The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this temple; his hands will also complete it. Then you will know that the Lord Almighty has sent me to you. "
"23999","Zechariah","4","10","“Who dares despise the day of small things, since the seven eyes of the Lord that range throughout the earth will rejoice when they see the chosen capstone # 4:10 Or the plumb line 4:10 Or the plumb line in the hand of Zerubbabel?” "
"24000","Zechariah","4","11","Then I asked the angel, “What are these two olive trees on the right and the left of the lampstand?” "
"24001","Zechariah","4","12","Again I asked him, “What are these two olive branches beside the two gold pipes that pour out golden oil?” "
"24002","Zechariah","4","13","He replied, “Do you not know what these are?” “No, my lord,” I said. "
"24003","Zechariah","4","14","So he said, “These are the two who are anointed to # 4:14 Or two who bring oil and 4:14 Or two who bring oil and serve the Lord of all the earth.” "
"24004","Zechariah","5","1","I looked again, and there before me was a flying scroll. "
"24005","Zechariah","5","2","He asked me, “What do you see?” I answered, “I see a flying scroll, twenty cubits long and ten cubits wide. # 5:2 That is, about 30 feet long and 15 feet wide or about 9 meters long and 4.5 meters wide 5:2 That is, about 30 feet long and 15 feet wide or about 9 meters long and 4.5 meters wide ” "
"24006","Zechariah","5","3","And he said to me, “This is the curse that is going out over the whole land; for according to what it says on one side, every thief will be banished, and according to what it says on the other, everyone who swears falsely will be banished. "
"24007","Zechariah","5","4","The Lord Almighty declares, ‘I will send it out, and it will enter the house of the thief and the house of anyone who swears falsely by my name. It will remain in that house and destroy it completely, both its timbers and its stones.’ ” "
"24008","Zechariah","5","5","Then the angel who was speaking to me came forward and said to me, “Look up and see what is appearing.” "
"24009","Zechariah","5","6","I asked, “What is it?” He replied, “It is a basket.” And he added, “This is the iniquity # 5:6 Or appearance 5:6 Or appearance of the people throughout the land.” "
"24010","Zechariah","5","7","Then the cover of lead was raised, and there in the basket sat a woman! "
"24011","Zechariah","5","8","He said, “This is wickedness,” and he pushed her back into the basket and pushed its lead cover down on it. "
"24012","Zechariah","5","9","Then I looked up—and there before me were two women, with the wind in their wings! They had wings like those of a stork, and they lifted up the basket between heaven and earth. "
"24013","Zechariah","5","10","“Where are they taking the basket?” I asked the angel who was speaking to me. "
"24014","Zechariah","5","11","He replied, “To the country of Babylonia # 5:11 Hebrew Shinar 5:11 Hebrew Shinar to build a house for it. When the house is ready, the basket will be set there in its place.” "
"24015","Zechariah","6","1","I looked up again, and there before me were four chariots coming out from between two mountains—mountains of bronze. "
"24016","Zechariah","6","2","The first chariot had red horses, the second black, "
"24017","Zechariah","6","3","the third white, and the fourth dappled—all of them powerful. "
"24018","Zechariah","6","4","I asked the angel who was speaking to me, “What are these, my lord?” "
"24019","Zechariah","6","5","The angel answered me, “These are the four spirits # 6:5 Or winds 6:5 Or winds of heaven, going out from standing in the presence of the Lord of the whole world. "
"24020","Zechariah","6","6","The one with the black horses is going toward the north country, the one with the white horses toward the west, # 6:6 Or horses after them 6:6 Or horses after them and the one with the dappled horses toward the south.” "
"24021","Zechariah","6","7","When the powerful horses went out, they were straining to go throughout the earth. And he said, “Go throughout the earth!” So they went throughout the earth. "
"24022","Zechariah","6","8","Then he called to me, “Look, those going toward the north country have given my Spirit # 6:8 Or spirit 6:8 Or spirit rest in the land of the north.” "
"24023","Zechariah","6","9","The word of the Lord came to me: "
"24024","Zechariah","6","10","“Take silver and gold from the exiles Heldai, Tobijah and Jedaiah, who have arrived from Babylon. Go the same day to the house of Josiah son of Zephaniah. "
"24025","Zechariah","6","11","Take the silver and gold and make a crown, and set it on the head of the high priest, Joshua son of Jozadak. # 6:11 Hebrew Jehozadak, a variant of Jozadak 6:11 Hebrew Jehozadak , a variant of Jozadak "
"24026","Zechariah","6","12","Tell him this is what the Lord Almighty says: ‘Here is the man whose name is the Branch, and he will branch out from his place and build the temple of the Lord . "

"24028","Zechariah","6","14","The crown will be given to Heldai, # 6:14 Syriac; Hebrew Helem 6:14 Syriac; Hebrew Helem Tobijah, Jedaiah and Hen # 6:14 Or and the gracious one, the 6:14 Or and the gracious one, the son of Zephaniah as a memorial in the temple of the Lord . "
"24029","Zechariah","6","15","Those who are far away will come and help to build the temple of the Lord , and you will know that the Lord Almighty has sent me to you. This will happen if you diligently obey the Lord your God.” "
"24030","Zechariah","7","1","In the fourth year of King Darius, the word of the Lord came to Zechariah on the fourth day of the ninth month, the month of Kislev. "
"24031","Zechariah","7","2","The people of Bethel had sent Sharezer and Regem-Melek, together with their men, to entreat the Lord "
"24032","Zechariah","7","3","by asking the priests of the house of the Lord Almighty and the prophets, “Should I mourn and fast in the fifth month, as I have done for so many years?” "
"24033","Zechariah","7","4","Then the word of the Lord Almighty came to me: "
"24034","Zechariah","7","5","“Ask all the people of the land and the priests, ‘When you fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh months for the past seventy years, was it really for me that you fasted? "
"24035","Zechariah","7","6","And when you were eating and drinking, were you not just feasting for yourselves? "
"24036","Zechariah","7","7","Are these not the words the Lord proclaimed through the earlier prophets when Jerusalem and its surrounding towns were at rest and prosperous, and the Negev and the western foothills were settled?’ ” "
"24037","Zechariah","7","8","And the word of the Lord came again to Zechariah: "
"24038","Zechariah","7","9","“This is what the Lord Almighty said: ‘Administer true justice; show mercy and compassion to one another. "

"24040","Zechariah","7","11","“But they refused to pay attention; stubbornly they turned their backs and covered their ears. "
"24041","Zechariah","7","12","They made their hearts as hard as flint and would not listen to the law or to the words that the Lord Almighty had sent by his Spirit through the earlier prophets. So the Lord Almighty was very angry. "
"24042","Zechariah","7","13","“ ‘When I called, they did not listen; so when they called, I would not listen,’ says the Lord Almighty. "
"24043","Zechariah","7","14","‘I scattered them with a whirlwind among all the nations, where they were strangers. The land they left behind them was so desolate that no one traveled through it. This is how they made the pleasant land desolate.’ ” "
"24044","Zechariah","8","1","The word of the Lord Almighty came to me. "
"24045","Zechariah","8","2","This is what the Lord Almighty says: “I am very jealous for Zion; I am burning with jealousy for her.” "
