"1","Genesis","1","1","In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.  "
"2","Genesis","1","2","Now the earth was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters. "
"3","Genesis","1","3","And God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light.  "
"4","Genesis","1","4","God saw that the light was good, and he separated the light from the darkness.  "
"5","Genesis","1","5","God called the light “day,” and the darkness he called “night.” And there was evening, and there was morning—the first day. "
"6","Genesis","1","6","And God said, “Let there be a vault between the waters to separate water from water.”  "
"7","Genesis","1","7","So God made the vault and separated the water under the vault from the water above it. And it was so.  "
"8","Genesis","1","8","God called the vault “sky.” And there was evening, and there was morning—the second day. "
"9","Genesis","1","9","And God said, “Let the water under the sky be gathered to one place, and let dry ground appear.” And it was so.  "
"10","Genesis","1","10","God called the dry ground “land,” and the gathered waters he called “seas.” And God saw that it was good. "
"11","Genesis","1","11","Then God said, “Let the land produce vegetation: seed-bearing plants and trees on the land that bear fruit with seed in it, according to their various kinds.” And it was so.  "
"12","Genesis","1","12","The land produced vegetation: plants bearing seed according to their kinds and trees bearing fruit with seed in it according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good.  "
"13","Genesis","1","13","And there was evening, and there was morning—the third day. "
"14","Genesis","1","14","And God said, “Let there be lights in the vault of the sky to separate the day from the night, and let them serve as signs to mark sacred times, and days and years,  "
"15","Genesis","1","15","and let them be lights in the vault of the sky to give light on the earth.” And it was so.  "
"16","Genesis","1","16","God made two great lights—the greater light to govern the day and the lesser light to govern the night. He also made the stars.  "
"17","Genesis","1","17","God set them in the vault of the sky to give light on the earth,  "
"18","Genesis","1","18","to govern the day and the night, and to separate light from darkness. And God saw that it was good.  "
"19","Genesis","1","19","And there was evening, and there was morning—the fourth day. "
"20","Genesis","1","20","And God said, “Let the water teem with living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the vault of the sky.”  "
"21","Genesis","1","21","So God created the great creatures of the sea and every living thing with which the water teems and that moves about in it, according to their kinds, and every winged bird according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.  "
"22","Genesis","1","22","God blessed them and said, “Be fruitful and increase in number and fill the water in the seas, and let the birds increase on the earth.”  "
"23","Genesis","1","23","And there was evening, and there was morning—the fifth day. "
"24","Genesis","1","24","And God said, “Let the land produce living creatures according to their kinds: the livestock, the creatures that move along the ground, and the wild animals, each according to its kind.” And it was so.  "
"25","Genesis","1","25","God made the wild animals according to their kinds, the livestock according to their kinds, and all the creatures that move along the ground according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good. "
"26","Genesis","1","26","Then God said, “Let us make mankind in our image, in our likeness, so that they may rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky, over the livestock and all the wild animals,  and over all the creatures that move along the ground.” "
"27","Genesis","1","27","So God created mankind in his own image, in the image of God he created them; male and female he created them. "
"28","Genesis","1","28","God blessed them and said to them, “Be fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it. Rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky and over every living creature that moves on the ground.” "
"29","Genesis","1","29","Then God said, “I give you every seed-bearing plant on the face of the whole earth and every tree that has fruit with seed in it. They will be yours for food.  "
"30","Genesis","1","30","And to all the beasts of the earth and all the birds in the sky and all the creatures that move along the ground—everything that has the breath of life in it—I give every green plant for food.” And it was so. "
"31","Genesis","1","31","God saw all that he had made, and it was very good. And there was evening, and there was morning—the sixth day."
"32","Genesis","2","1","Thus the heavens and the earth were completed in all their vast array. "
"33","Genesis","2","2","By the seventh day God had finished the work he had been doing; so on the seventh day he rested from all his work.  "
"34","Genesis","2","3","Then God blessed the seventh day and made it holy, because on it he rested from all the work of creating that he had done. "
"35","Genesis","2","4","This is the account of the heavens and the earth when they were created, when the  Lord  God made the earth and the heavens. "
"36","Genesis","2","5","Now no shrub had yet appeared on the earth  and no plant had yet sprung up, for the  Lord  God had not sent rain on the earth and there was no one to work the ground,  "
"37","Genesis","2","6","but streams  came up from the earth and watered the whole surface of the ground.  "
"38","Genesis","2","7","Then the  Lord  God formed a man  from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living being. "
"39","Genesis","2","8","Now the  Lord  God had planted a garden in the east, in Eden; and there he put the man he had formed.  "
"40","Genesis","2","9","The  Lord  God made all kinds of trees grow out of the ground—trees that were pleasing to the eye and good for food. In the middle of the garden were the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. "
"41","Genesis","2","10","A river watering the garden flowed from Eden; from there it was separated into four headwaters.  "
"42","Genesis","2","11","The name of the first is the Pishon; it winds through the entire land of Havilah, where there is gold.  "
"43","Genesis","2","12","(The gold of that land is good; aromatic resin  and onyx are also there.)  "
"44","Genesis","2","13","The name of the second river is the Gihon; it winds through the entire land of Cush.   "
"45","Genesis","2","14","The name of the third river is the Tigris; it runs along the east side of Ashur. And the fourth river is the Euphrates. "
"46","Genesis","2","15","The  Lord  God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to work it and take care of it.  "
"47","Genesis","2","16","And the  Lord  God commanded the man, “You are free to eat from any tree in the garden;  "
"48","Genesis","2","17","but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat from it you will certainly die.” "
"49","Genesis","2","18","The  Lord  God said, “It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make a helper suitable for him.” "
"50","Genesis","2","19","Now the  Lord  God had formed out of the ground all the wild animals and all the birds in the sky. He brought them to the man to see what he would name them; and whatever the man called each living creature, that was its name.  "
"51","Genesis","2","20","So the man gave names to all the livestock, the birds in the sky and all the wild animals. But for Adam  no suitable helper was found.  "
"52","Genesis","2","21","So the  Lord  God caused the man to fall into a deep sleep; and while he was sleeping, he took one of the man’s ribs  and then closed up the place with flesh.  "
"53","Genesis","2","22","Then the  Lord  God made a woman from the rib  he had taken out of the man, and he brought her to the man. "
"54","Genesis","2","23","The man said, “This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called ‘woman,’ for she was taken out of man.” "
"55","Genesis","2","24","That is why a man leaves his father and mother and is united to his wife, and they become one flesh. "
"56","Genesis","2","25","Adam and his wife were both naked, and they felt no shame."
"57","Genesis","3","1","Now the serpent was more crafty than any of the wild animals the  Lord  God had made. He said to the woman, “Did God really say, ‘You must not eat from any tree in the garden’?” "
"58","Genesis","3","2","The woman said to the serpent, “We may eat fruit from the trees in the garden,  "
"59","Genesis","3","3","but God did say, ‘You must not eat fruit from the tree that is in the middle of the garden, and you must not touch it, or you will die.’ ” "
"60","Genesis","3","4","“You will not certainly die,” the serpent said to the woman.  "
"61","Genesis","3","5","“For God knows that when you eat from it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.” "
"62","Genesis","3","6","When the woman saw that the fruit of the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eye, and also desirable for gaining wisdom, she took some and ate it. She also gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate it.  "
"63","Genesis","3","7","Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they realized they were naked; so they sewed fig leaves together and made coverings for themselves. "
"64","Genesis","3","8","Then the man and his wife heard the sound of the  Lord  God as he was walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and they hid from the  Lord  God among the trees of the garden.  "
"65","Genesis","3","9","But the  Lord  God called to the man, “Where are you?” "
"66","Genesis","3","10","He answered, “I heard you in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked; so I hid.” "
"67","Genesis","3","11","And he said, “Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree that I commanded you not to eat from?” "
"68","Genesis","3","12","The man said, “The woman you put here with me—she gave me some fruit from the tree, and I ate it.” "
"69","Genesis","3","13","Then the  Lord  God said to the woman, “What is this you have done?” The woman said, “The serpent deceived me, and I ate.” "
"70","Genesis","3","14","So the  Lord  God said to the serpent, “Because you have done this, “Cursed are you above all livestock and all wild animals! You will crawl on your belly and you will eat dust all the days of your life. "
"71","Genesis","3","15","And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring  and hers; he will crush  your head, and you will strike his heel.” "
"72","Genesis","3","16","To the woman he said, “I will make your pains in childbearing very severe; with painful labor you will give birth to children. Your desire will be for your husband, and he will rule over you.” "
"73","Genesis","3","17","To Adam he said, “Because you listened to your wife and ate fruit from the tree about which I commanded you, ‘You must not eat from it,’ “Cursed is the ground because of you; through painful toil you will eat food from it all the days of your life. "
"74","Genesis","3","18","It will produce thorns and thistles for you, and you will eat the plants of the field. "
"75","Genesis","3","19","By the sweat of your brow you will eat your food until you return to the ground, since from it you were taken; for dust you are and to dust you will return.” "
"76","Genesis","3","20","Adam  named his wife Eve,  because she would become the mother of all the living. "
"77","Genesis","3","21","The  Lord  God made garments of skin for Adam and his wife and clothed them.  "
"78","Genesis","3","22","And the  Lord  God said, “The man has now become like one of us, knowing good and evil. He must not be allowed to reach out his hand and take also from the tree of life and eat, and live forever.”  "
"79","Genesis","3","23","So the  Lord  God banished him from the Garden of Eden to work the ground from which he had been taken.  "
"80","Genesis","3","24","After he drove the man out, he placed on the east side  of the Garden of Eden cherubim and a flaming sword flashing back and forth to guard the way to the tree of life."
"81","Genesis","4","1","Adam  made love to his wife Eve, and she became pregnant and gave birth to Cain.  She said, “With the help of the  Lord  I have brought forth  a man.”  "
"82","Genesis","4","2","Later she gave birth to his brother Abel. Now Abel kept flocks, and Cain worked the soil.  "
"83","Genesis","4","3","In the course of time Cain brought some of the fruits of the soil as an offering to the  Lord .  "
"84","Genesis","4","4","And Abel also brought an offering—fat portions from some of the firstborn of his flock. The  Lord  looked with favor on Abel and his offering,  "
"85","Genesis","4","5","but on Cain and his offering he did not look with favor. So Cain was very angry, and his face was downcast. "
"86","Genesis","4","6","Then the  Lord  said to Cain, “Why are you angry? Why is your face downcast?  "
"87","Genesis","4","7","If you do what is right, will you not be accepted? But if you do not do what is right, sin is crouching at your door; it desires to have you, but you must rule over it.” "
"88","Genesis","4","8","Now Cain said to his brother Abel, “Let’s go out to the field.”  While they were in the field, Cain attacked his brother Abel and killed him. "
"89","Genesis","4","9","Then the  Lord  said to Cain, “Where is your brother Abel?” “I don’t know,” he replied. “Am I my brother’s keeper?” "
"90","Genesis","4","10","The  Lord  said, “What have you done? Listen! Your brother’s blood cries out to me from the ground.  "
"91","Genesis","4","11","Now you are under a curse and driven from the ground, which opened its mouth to receive your brother’s blood from your hand.  "
"92","Genesis","4","12","When you work the ground, it will no longer yield its crops for you. You will be a restless wanderer on the earth.” "
"93","Genesis","4","13","Cain said to the  Lord , “My punishment is more than I can bear.  "
"94","Genesis","4","14","Today you are driving me from the land, and I will be hidden from your presence; I will be a restless wanderer on the earth, and whoever finds me will kill me.” "
"95","Genesis","4","15","But the  Lord  said to him, “Not so ; anyone who kills Cain will suffer vengeance seven times over.” Then the  Lord  put a mark on Cain so that no one who found him would kill him.  "
"96","Genesis","4","16","So Cain went out from the  Lord ’s presence and lived in the land of Nod,  east of Eden. "
"97","Genesis","4","17","Cain made love to his wife, and she became pregnant and gave birth to Enoch. Cain was then building a city, and he named it after his son Enoch.  "
"98","Genesis","4","18","To Enoch was born Irad, and Irad was the father of Mehujael, and Mehujael was the father of Methushael, and Methushael was the father of Lamech. "
"99","Genesis","4","19","Lamech married two women, one named Adah and the other Zillah.  "
"100","Genesis","4","20","Adah gave birth to Jabal; he was the father of those who live in tents and raise livestock.  "
"101","Genesis","4","21","His brother’s name was Jubal; he was the father of all who play stringed instruments and pipes.  "
"102","Genesis","4","22","Zillah also had a son, Tubal-Cain, who forged all kinds of tools out of  bronze and iron. Tubal-Cain’s sister was Naamah. "
"103","Genesis","4","23","Lamech said to his wives, “Adah and Zillah, listen to me; wives of Lamech, hear my words. I have killed a man for wounding me, a young man for injuring me. "
"104","Genesis","4","24","If Cain is avenged seven times, then Lamech seventy-seven times.” "
"105","Genesis","4","25","Adam made love to his wife again, and she gave birth to a son and named him Seth,  saying, “God has granted me another child in place of Abel, since Cain killed him.”  "
"106","Genesis","4","26","Seth also had a son, and he named him Enosh. At that time people began to call on  the name of the  Lord ."
"107","Genesis","5","1","This is the written account of Adam’s family line. When God created mankind, he made them in the likeness of God.  "
"108","Genesis","5","2","He created them male and female and blessed them. And he named them “Mankind”  when they were created. "
"109","Genesis","5","3","When Adam had lived 130 years, he had a son in his own likeness, in his own image; and he named him Seth.  "
"110","Genesis","5","4","After Seth was born, Adam lived 800 years and had other sons and daughters.  "
"111","Genesis","5","5","Altogether, Adam lived a total of 930 years, and then he died. "
"112","Genesis","5","6","When Seth had lived 105 years, he became the father  of Enosh.  "
"113","Genesis","5","7","After he became the father of Enosh, Seth lived 807 years and had other sons and daughters.  "
"114","Genesis","5","8","Altogether, Seth lived a total of 912 years, and then he died. "
"115","Genesis","5","9","When Enosh had lived 90 years, he became the father of Kenan.  "
"116","Genesis","5","10","After he became the father of Kenan, Enosh lived 815 years and had other sons and daughters.  "
"117","Genesis","5","11","Altogether, Enosh lived a total of 905 years, and then he died. "
"118","Genesis","5","12","When Kenan had lived 70 years, he became the father of Mahalalel.  "
"119","Genesis","5","13","After he became the father of Mahalalel, Kenan lived 840 years and had other sons and daughters.  "
"120","Genesis","5","14","Altogether, Kenan lived a total of 910 years, and then he died. "
"121","Genesis","5","15","When Mahalalel had lived 65 years, he became the father of Jared.  "
"122","Genesis","5","16","After he became the father of Jared, Mahalalel lived 830 years and had other sons and daughters.  "
"123","Genesis","5","17","Altogether, Mahalalel lived a total of 895 years, and then he died. "
"124","Genesis","5","18","When Jared had lived 162 years, he became the father of Enoch.  "
"125","Genesis","5","19","After he became the father of Enoch, Jared lived 800 years and had other sons and daughters.  "
"126","Genesis","5","20","Altogether, Jared lived a total of 962 years, and then he died. "
"127","Genesis","5","21","When Enoch had lived 65 years, he became the father of Methuselah.  "
"128","Genesis","5","22","After he became the father of Methuselah, Enoch walked faithfully with God 300 years and had other sons and daughters.  "
"129","Genesis","5","23","Altogether, Enoch lived a total of 365 years.  "
"130","Genesis","5","24","Enoch walked faithfully with God; then he was no more, because God took him away. "
"131","Genesis","5","25","When Methuselah had lived 187 years, he became the father of Lamech.  "
"132","Genesis","5","26","After he became the father of Lamech, Methuselah lived 782 years and had other sons and daughters.  "
"133","Genesis","5","27","Altogether, Methuselah lived a total of 969 years, and then he died. "
"134","Genesis","5","28","When Lamech had lived 182 years, he had a son.  "
"135","Genesis","5","29","He named him Noah  and said, “He will comfort us in the labor and painful toil of our hands caused by the ground the  Lord  has cursed.”  "
"136","Genesis","5","30","After Noah was born, Lamech lived 595 years and had other sons and daughters.  "
"137","Genesis","5","31","Altogether, Lamech lived a total of 777 years, and then he died. "
"138","Genesis","5","32","After Noah was 500 years old, he became the father of Shem, Ham and Japheth."
"139","Genesis","6","1","When human beings began to increase in number on the earth and daughters were born to them,  "
"140","Genesis","6","2","the sons of God saw that the daughters of humans were beautiful, and they married any of them they chose.  "
"141","Genesis","6","3","Then the  Lord  said, “My Spirit will not contend with  humans forever, for they are mortal ; their days will be a hundred and twenty years.” "
"142","Genesis","6","4","The Nephilim were on the earth in those days—and also afterward—when the sons of God went to the daughters of humans and had children by them. They were the heroes of old, men of renown. "
"143","Genesis","6","5","The  Lord  saw how great the wickedness of the human race had become on the earth, and that every inclination of the thoughts of the human heart was only evil all the time.  "
"144","Genesis","6","6","The  Lord  regretted that he had made human beings on the earth, and his heart was deeply troubled.  "
"145","Genesis","6","7","So the  Lord  said, “I will wipe from the face of the earth the human race I have created—and with them the animals, the birds and the creatures that move along the ground—for I regret that I have made them.”  "
"146","Genesis","6","8","But Noah found favor in the eyes of the  Lord . "
"147","Genesis","6","9","This is the account of Noah and his family. Noah was a righteous man, blameless among the people of his time, and he walked faithfully with God.  "
"148","Genesis","6","10","Noah had three sons: Shem, Ham and Japheth. "
"149","Genesis","6","11","Now the earth was corrupt in God’s sight and was full of violence.  "
"150","Genesis","6","12","God saw how corrupt the earth had become, for all the people on earth had corrupted their ways.  "
"151","Genesis","6","13","So God said to Noah, “I am going to put an end to all people, for the earth is filled with violence because of them. I am surely going to destroy both them and the earth.  "
"152","Genesis","6","14","So make yourself an ark of cypress  wood; make rooms in it and coat it with pitch inside and out.  "
"153","Genesis","6","15","This is how you are to build it: The ark is to be three hundred cubits long, fifty cubits wide and thirty cubits high.   "
"154","Genesis","6","16","Make a roof for it, leaving below the roof an opening one cubit  high all around.  Put a door in the side of the ark and make lower, middle and upper decks.  "
"155","Genesis","6","17","I am going to bring floodwaters on the earth to destroy all life under the heavens, every creature that has the breath of life in it. Everything on earth will perish.  "
"156","Genesis","6","18","But I will establish my covenant with you, and you will enter the ark—you and your sons and your wife and your sons’ wives with you.  "
"157","Genesis","6","19","You are to bring into the ark two of all living creatures, male and female, to keep them alive with you.  "
"158","Genesis","6","20","Two of every kind of bird, of every kind of animal and of every kind of creature that moves along the ground will come to you to be kept alive.  "
"159","Genesis","6","21","You are to take every kind of food that is to be eaten and store it away as food for you and for them.” "
"160","Genesis","6","22","Noah did everything just as God commanded him."
"161","Genesis","7","1","The  Lord  then said to Noah, “Go into the ark, you and your whole family, because I have found you righteous in this generation.  "
"162","Genesis","7","2","Take with you seven pairs of every kind of clean animal, a male and its mate, and one pair of every kind of unclean animal, a male and its mate,  "
"163","Genesis","7","3","and also seven pairs of every kind of bird, male and female, to keep their various kinds alive throughout the earth.  "
"164","Genesis","7","4","Seven days from now I will send rain on the earth for forty days and forty nights, and I will wipe from the face of the earth every living creature I have made.” "
"165","Genesis","7","5","And Noah did all that the  Lord  commanded him. "
"166","Genesis","7","6","Noah was six hundred years old when the floodwaters came on the earth.  "
"167","Genesis","7","7","And Noah and his sons and his wife and his sons’ wives entered the ark to escape the waters of the flood.  "
"168","Genesis","7","8","Pairs of clean and unclean animals, of birds and of all creatures that move along the ground,  "
"169","Genesis","7","9","male and female, came to Noah and entered the ark, as God had commanded Noah.  "
"170","Genesis","7","10","And after the seven days the floodwaters came on the earth. "
"171","Genesis","7","11","In the six hundredth year of Noah’s life, on the seventeenth day of the second month—on that day all the springs of the great deep burst forth, and the floodgates of the heavens were opened.  "
"172","Genesis","7","12","And rain fell on the earth forty days and forty nights. "
"173","Genesis","7","13","On that very day Noah and his sons, Shem, Ham and Japheth, together with his wife and the wives of his three sons, entered the ark.  "
"174","Genesis","7","14","They had with them every wild animal according to its kind, all livestock according to their kinds, every creature that moves along the ground according to its kind and every bird according to its kind, everything with wings.  "
"175","Genesis","7","15","Pairs of all creatures that have the breath of life in them came to Noah and entered the ark.  "
"176","Genesis","7","16","The animals going in were male and female of every living thing, as God had commanded Noah. Then the  Lord  shut him in. "
"177","Genesis","7","17","For forty days the flood kept coming on the earth, and as the waters increased they lifted the ark high above the earth.  "
"178","Genesis","7","18","The waters rose and increased greatly on the earth, and the ark floated on the surface of the water.  "
"179","Genesis","7","19","They rose greatly on the earth, and all the high mountains under the entire heavens were covered.  "
"180","Genesis","7","20","The waters rose and covered the mountains to a depth of more than fifteen cubits.   "
"181","Genesis","7","21","Every living thing that moved on land perished—birds, livestock, wild animals, all the creatures that swarm over the earth, and all mankind.  "
"182","Genesis","7","22","Everything on dry land that had the breath of life in its nostrils died.  "
"183","Genesis","7","23","Every living thing on the face of the earth was wiped out; people and animals and the creatures that move along the ground and the birds were wiped from the earth. Only Noah was left, and those with him in the ark. "
"184","Genesis","7","24","The waters flooded the earth for a hundred and fifty days."
"185","Genesis","8","1","But God remembered Noah and all the wild animals and the livestock that were with him in the ark, and he sent a wind over the earth, and the waters receded.  "
"186","Genesis","8","2","Now the springs of the deep and the floodgates of the heavens had been closed, and the rain had stopped falling from the sky.  "
"187","Genesis","8","3","The water receded steadily from the earth. At the end of the hundred and fifty days the water had gone down,  "
"188","Genesis","8","4","and on the seventeenth day of the seventh month the ark came to rest on the mountains of Ararat.  "
"189","Genesis","8","5","The waters continued to recede until the tenth month, and on the first day of the tenth month the tops of the mountains became visible. "
"190","Genesis","8","6","After forty days Noah opened a window he had made in the ark  "
"191","Genesis","8","7","and sent out a raven, and it kept flying back and forth until the water had dried up from the earth.  "
"192","Genesis","8","8","Then he sent out a dove to see if the water had receded from the surface of the ground.  "
"193","Genesis","8","9","But the dove could find nowhere to perch because there was water over all the surface of the earth; so it returned to Noah in the ark. He reached out his hand and took the dove and brought it back to himself in the ark.  "
"194","Genesis","8","10","He waited seven more days and again sent out the dove from the ark.  "
"195","Genesis","8","11","When the dove returned to him in the evening, there in its beak was a freshly plucked olive leaf! Then Noah knew that the water had receded from the earth.  "
"196","Genesis","8","12","He waited seven more days and sent the dove out again, but this time it did not return to him. "
"197","Genesis","8","13","By the first day of the first month of Noah’s six hundred and first year, the water had dried up from the earth. Noah then removed the covering from the ark and saw that the surface of the ground was dry.  "
"198","Genesis","8","14","By the twenty-seventh day of the second month the earth was completely dry. "
"199","Genesis","8","15","Then God said to Noah,  "
"200","Genesis","8","16","“Come out of the ark, you and your wife and your sons and their wives.  "
"201","Genesis","8","17","Bring out every kind of living creature that is with you—the birds, the animals, and all the creatures that move along the ground—so they can multiply on the earth and be fruitful and increase in number on it.” "
"202","Genesis","8","18","So Noah came out, together with his sons and his wife and his sons’ wives.  "
"203","Genesis","8","19","All the animals and all the creatures that move along the ground and all the birds—everything that moves on land—came out of the ark, one kind after another. "
"204","Genesis","8","20","Then Noah built an altar to the  Lord  and, taking some of all the clean animals and clean birds, he sacrificed burnt offerings on it.  "
"205","Genesis","8","21","The  Lord  smelled the pleasing aroma and said in his heart: “Never again will I curse the ground because of humans, even though  every inclination of the human heart is evil from childhood. And never again will I destroy all living creatures, as I have done. "
"206","Genesis","8","22","“As long as the earth endures, seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, day and night will never cease.”"
"207","Genesis","9","1","Then God blessed Noah and his sons, saying to them, “Be fruitful and increase in number and fill the earth.  "
"208","Genesis","9","2","The fear and dread of you will fall on all the beasts of the earth, and on all the birds in the sky, on every creature that moves along the ground, and on all the fish in the sea; they are given into your hands.  "
"209","Genesis","9","3","Everything that lives and moves about will be food for you. Just as I gave you the green plants, I now give you everything. "
"210","Genesis","9","4","“But you must not eat meat that has its lifeblood still in it.  "
"211","Genesis","9","5","And for your lifeblood I will surely demand an accounting. I will demand an accounting from every animal. And from each human being, too, I will demand an accounting for the life of another human being. "
"212","Genesis","9","6","“Whoever sheds human blood, by humans shall their blood be shed; for in the image of God has God made mankind. "
"213","Genesis","9","7","As for you, be fruitful and increase in number; multiply on the earth and increase upon it.” "
"214","Genesis","9","8","Then God said to Noah and to his sons with him:  "
"215","Genesis","9","9","“I now establish my covenant with you and with your descendants after you  "
"216","Genesis","9","10","and with every living creature that was with you—the birds, the livestock and all the wild animals, all those that came out of the ark with you—every living creature on earth.  "
"217","Genesis","9","11","I establish my covenant with you: Never again will all life be destroyed by the waters of a flood; never again will there be a flood to destroy the earth.” "
"218","Genesis","9","12","And God said, “This is the sign of the covenant I am making between me and you and every living creature with you, a covenant for all generations to come:  "
"219","Genesis","9","13","I have set my rainbow in the clouds, and it will be the sign of the covenant between me and the earth.  "
"220","Genesis","9","14","Whenever I bring clouds over the earth and the rainbow appears in the clouds,  "
"221","Genesis","9","15","I will remember my covenant between me and you and all living creatures of every kind. Never again will the waters become a flood to destroy all life.  "
"222","Genesis","9","16","Whenever the rainbow appears in the clouds, I will see it and remember the everlasting covenant between God and all living creatures of every kind on the earth.” "
"223","Genesis","9","17","So God said to Noah, “This is the sign of the covenant I have established between me and all life on the earth.” "
"224","Genesis","9","18","The sons of Noah who came out of the ark were Shem, Ham and Japheth. (Ham was the father of Canaan.)  "
"225","Genesis","9","19","These were the three sons of Noah, and from them came the people who were scattered over the whole earth. "
"226","Genesis","9","20","Noah, a man of the soil, proceeded  to plant a vineyard.  "
"227","Genesis","9","21","When he drank some of its wine, he became drunk and lay uncovered inside his tent.  "
"228","Genesis","9","22","Ham, the father of Canaan, saw his father naked and told his two brothers outside.  "
"229","Genesis","9","23","But Shem and Japheth took a garment and laid it across their shoulders; then they walked in backward and covered their father’s naked body. Their faces were turned the other way so that they would not see their father naked. "
"230","Genesis","9","24","When Noah awoke from his wine and found out what his youngest son had done to him,  "
"231","Genesis","9","25","he said, “Cursed be Canaan! The lowest of slaves will he be to his brothers.” "
"232","Genesis","9","26","He also said, “Praise be to the  Lord , the God of Shem! May Canaan be the slave of Shem. "
"233","Genesis","9","27","May God extend Japheth’s  territory; may Japheth live in the tents of Shem, and may Canaan be the slave of Japheth.” "
"234","Genesis","9","28","After the flood Noah lived 350 years.  "
"235","Genesis","9","29","Noah lived a total of 950 years, and then he died."
"236","Genesis","10","1","This is the account of Shem, Ham and Japheth, Noah’s sons, who themselves had sons after the flood. "
"237","Genesis","10","2","The sons  of Japheth: Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshek and Tiras. "
"238","Genesis","10","3","The sons of Gomer: Ashkenaz, Riphath and Togarmah. "
"239","Genesis","10","4","The sons of Javan: Elishah, Tarshish, the Kittites and the Rodanites.   "
"240","Genesis","10","5","(From these the maritime peoples spread out into their territories by their clans within their nations, each with its own language.) "
"241","Genesis","10","6","The sons of Ham: Cush, Egypt, Put and Canaan. "
"242","Genesis","10","7","The sons of Cush: Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah and Sabteka. The sons of Raamah: Sheba and Dedan. "
"243","Genesis","10","8","Cush was the father  of Nimrod, who became a mighty warrior on the earth.  "
"244","Genesis","10","9","He was a mighty hunter before the  Lord ; that is why it is said, “Like Nimrod, a mighty hunter before the  Lord .”  "
"245","Genesis","10","10","The first centers of his kingdom were Babylon, Uruk, Akkad and Kalneh, in  Shinar.   "
"246","Genesis","10","11","From that land he went to Assyria, where he built Nineveh, Rehoboth Ir,  Calah  "
"247","Genesis","10","12","and Resen, which is between Nineveh and Calah—which is the great city. "
"248","Genesis","10","13","Egypt was the father of the Ludites, Anamites, Lehabites, Naphtuhites,  "
"249","Genesis","10","14","Pathrusites, Kasluhites (from whom the Philistines came) and Caphtorites. "
"250","Genesis","10","15","Canaan was the father of Sidon his firstborn,  and of the Hittites,  "
"251","Genesis","10","16","Jebusites, Amorites, Girgashites,  "
"252","Genesis","10","17","Hivites, Arkites, Sinites,  "
"253","Genesis","10","18","Arvadites, Zemarites and Hamathites. Later the Canaanite clans scattered  "
"254","Genesis","10","19","and the borders of Canaan reached from Sidon toward Gerar as far as Gaza, and then toward Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboyim, as far as Lasha. "
"255","Genesis","10","20","These are the sons of Ham by their clans and languages, in their territories and nations. "
"256","Genesis","10","21","Sons were also born to Shem, whose older brother was  Japheth; Shem was the ancestor of all the sons of Eber. "
"257","Genesis","10","22","The sons of Shem: Elam, Ashur, Arphaxad, Lud and Aram. "
"258","Genesis","10","23","The sons of Aram: Uz, Hul, Gether and Meshek. "
"259","Genesis","10","24","Arphaxad was the father of  Shelah, and Shelah the father of Eber. "
"260","Genesis","10","25","Two sons were born to Eber: One was named Peleg,  because in his time the earth was divided; his brother was named Joktan. "
"261","Genesis","10","26","Joktan was the father of Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah,  "
"262","Genesis","10","27","Hadoram, Uzal, Diklah,  "
"263","Genesis","10","28","Obal, Abimael, Sheba,  "
"264","Genesis","10","29","Ophir, Havilah and Jobab. All these were sons of Joktan. "
"265","Genesis","10","30","The region where they lived stretched from Mesha toward Sephar, in the eastern hill country. "
"266","Genesis","10","31","These are the sons of Shem by their clans and languages, in their territories and nations. "
"267","Genesis","10","32","These are the clans of Noah’s sons, according to their lines of descent, within their nations. From these the nations spread out over the earth after the flood."
"268","Genesis","11","1","Now the whole world had one language and a common speech.  "
"269","Genesis","11","2","As people moved eastward,  they found a plain in Shinar  and settled there. "
"270","Genesis","11","3","They said to each other, “Come, let’s make bricks and bake them thoroughly.” They used brick instead of stone, and tar for mortar.  "
"271","Genesis","11","4","Then they said, “Come, let us build ourselves a city, with a tower that reaches to the heavens, so that we may make a name for ourselves; otherwise we will be scattered over the face of the whole earth.” "
"272","Genesis","11","5","But the  Lord  came down to see the city and the tower the people were building.  "
"273","Genesis","11","6","The  Lord  said, “If as one people speaking the same language they have begun to do this, then nothing they plan to do will be impossible for them.  "
"274","Genesis","11","7","Come, let us go down and confuse their language so they will not understand each other.” "
"275","Genesis","11","8","So the  Lord  scattered them from there over all the earth, and they stopped building the city.  "
"276","Genesis","11","9","That is why it was called Babel —because there the  Lord  confused the language of the whole world. From there the  Lord  scattered them over the face of the whole earth. "
"277","Genesis","11","10","This is the account of Shem’s family line. Two years after the flood, when Shem was 100 years old, he became the father  of Arphaxad.  "
"278","Genesis","11","11","And after he became the father of Arphaxad, Shem lived 500 years and had other sons and daughters. "
"279","Genesis","11","12","When Arphaxad had lived 35 years, he became the father of Shelah.  "
"280","Genesis","11","13","And after he became the father of Shelah, Arphaxad lived 403 years and had other sons and daughters. "
"281","Genesis","11","14","When Shelah had lived 30 years, he became the father of Eber.  "
"282","Genesis","11","15","And after he became the father of Eber, Shelah lived 403 years and had other sons and daughters. "
"283","Genesis","11","16","When Eber had lived 34 years, he became the father of Peleg.  "
"284","Genesis","11","17","And after he became the father of Peleg, Eber lived 430 years and had other sons and daughters. "
"285","Genesis","11","18","When Peleg had lived 30 years, he became the father of Reu.  "
"286","Genesis","11","19","And after he became the father of Reu, Peleg lived 209 years and had other sons and daughters. "
"287","Genesis","11","20","When Reu had lived 32 years, he became the father of Serug.  "
"288","Genesis","11","21","And after he became the father of Serug, Reu lived 207 years and had other sons and daughters. "
"289","Genesis","11","22","When Serug had lived 30 years, he became the father of Nahor.  "
"290","Genesis","11","23","And after he became the father of Nahor, Serug lived 200 years and had other sons and daughters. "
"291","Genesis","11","24","When Nahor had lived 29 years, he became the father of Terah.  "
"292","Genesis","11","25","And after he became the father of Terah, Nahor lived 119 years and had other sons and daughters. "
"293","Genesis","11","26","After Terah had lived 70 years, he became the father of Abram, Nahor and Haran. "
"294","Genesis","11","27","This is the account of Terah’s family line. Terah became the father of Abram, Nahor and Haran. And Haran became the father of Lot.  "
"295","Genesis","11","28","While his father Terah was still alive, Haran died in Ur of the Chaldeans, in the land of his birth.  "
"296","Genesis","11","29","Abram and Nahor both married. The name of Abram’s wife was Sarai, and the name of Nahor’s wife was Milkah; she was the daughter of Haran, the father of both Milkah and Iskah.  "
"297","Genesis","11","30","Now Sarai was childless because she was not able to conceive. "
"298","Genesis","11","31","Terah took his son Abram, his grandson Lot son of Haran, and his daughter-in-law Sarai, the wife of his son Abram, and together they set out from Ur of the Chaldeans to go to Canaan. But when they came to Harran, they settled there. "
"299","Genesis","11","32","Terah lived 205 years, and he died in Harran."
"300","Genesis","12","1","The  Lord  had said to Abram, “Go from your country, your people and your father’s household to the land I will show you. "
"301","Genesis","12","2","“I will make you into a great nation, and I will bless you; I will make your name great, and you will be a blessing. "
"302","Genesis","12","3","I will bless those who bless you, and whoever curses you I will curse; and all peoples on earth will be blessed through you.” "
"303","Genesis","12","4","So Abram went, as the  Lord  had told him; and Lot went with him. Abram was seventy-five years old when he set out from Harran.  "
"304","Genesis","12","5","He took his wife Sarai, his nephew Lot, all the possessions they had accumulated and the people they had acquired in Harran, and they set out for the land of Canaan, and they arrived there. "
"305","Genesis","12","6","Abram traveled through the land as far as the site of the great tree of Moreh at Shechem. At that time the Canaanites were in the land.  "
"306","Genesis","12","7","The  Lord  appeared to Abram and said, “To your offspring  I will give this land.” So he built an altar there to the  Lord , who had appeared to him. "
"307","Genesis","12","8","From there he went on toward the hills east of Bethel and pitched his tent, with Bethel on the west and Ai on the east. There he built an altar to the  Lord  and called on the name of the  Lord . "
"308","Genesis","12","9","Then Abram set out and continued toward the Negev. "
"309","Genesis","12","10","Now there was a famine in the land, and Abram went down to Egypt to live there for a while because the famine was severe.  "
"310","Genesis","12","11","As he was about to enter Egypt, he said to his wife Sarai, “I know what a beautiful woman you are.  "
"311","Genesis","12","12","When the Egyptians see you, they will say, ‘This is his wife.’ Then they will kill me but will let you live.  "
"312","Genesis","12","13","Say you are my sister, so that I will be treated well for your sake and my life will be spared because of you.” "
"313","Genesis","12","14","When Abram came to Egypt, the Egyptians saw that Sarai was a very beautiful woman.  "
"314","Genesis","12","15","And when Pharaoh’s officials saw her, they praised her to Pharaoh, and she was taken into his palace.  "
"315","Genesis","12","16","He treated Abram well for her sake, and Abram acquired sheep and cattle, male and female donkeys, male and female servants, and camels. "
"316","Genesis","12","17","But the  Lord  inflicted serious diseases on Pharaoh and his household because of Abram’s wife Sarai.  "
"317","Genesis","12","18","So Pharaoh summoned Abram. “What have you done to me?” he said. “Why didn’t you tell me she was your wife?  "
"318","Genesis","12","19","Why did you say, ‘She is my sister,’ so that I took her to be my wife? Now then, here is your wife. Take her and go!”  "
"319","Genesis","12","20","Then Pharaoh gave orders about Abram to his men, and they sent him on his way, with his wife and everything he had."
"320","Genesis","13","1","So Abram went up from Egypt to the Negev, with his wife and everything he had, and Lot went with him.  "
"321","Genesis","13","2","Abram had become very wealthy in livestock and in silver and gold. "
"322","Genesis","13","3","From the Negev he went from place to place until he came to Bethel, to the place between Bethel and Ai where his tent had been earlier  "
"323","Genesis","13","4","and where he had first built an altar. There Abram called on the name of the  Lord . "
"324","Genesis","13","5","Now Lot, who was moving about with Abram, also had flocks and herds and tents.  "
"325","Genesis","13","6","But the land could not support them while they stayed together, for their possessions were so great that they were not able to stay together.  "
"326","Genesis","13","7","And quarreling arose between Abram’s herders and Lot’s. The Canaanites and Perizzites were also living in the land at that time. "
"327","Genesis","13","8","So Abram said to Lot, “Let’s not have any quarreling between you and me, or between your herders and mine, for we are close relatives.  "
"328","Genesis","13","9","Is not the whole land before you? Let’s part company. If you go to the left, I’ll go to the right; if you go to the right, I’ll go to the left.” "
"329","Genesis","13","10","Lot looked around and saw that the whole plain of the Jordan toward Zoar was well watered, like the garden of the  Lord , like the land of Egypt. (This was before the  Lord  destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah.)  "
"330","Genesis","13","11","So Lot chose for himself the whole plain of the Jordan and set out toward the east. The two men parted company:  "
"331","Genesis","13","12","Abram lived in the land of Canaan, while Lot lived among the cities of the plain and pitched his tents near Sodom.  "
"332","Genesis","13","13","Now the people of Sodom were wicked and were sinning greatly against the  Lord . "
"333","Genesis","13","14","The  Lord  said to Abram after Lot had parted from him, “Look around from where you are, to the north and south, to the east and west.  "
"334","Genesis","13","15","All the land that you see I will give to you and your offspring  forever.  "
"335","Genesis","13","16","I will make your offspring like the dust of the earth, so that if anyone could count the dust, then your offspring could be counted.  "
"336","Genesis","13","17","Go, walk through the length and breadth of the land, for I am giving it to you.” "
"337","Genesis","13","18","So Abram went to live near the great trees of Mamre at Hebron, where he pitched his tents. There he built an altar to the  Lord ."
"338","Genesis","14","1","At the time when Amraphel was king of Shinar,  Arioch king of Ellasar, Kedorlaomer king of Elam and Tidal king of Goyim,  "
"339","Genesis","14","2","these kings went to war against Bera king of Sodom, Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, Shemeber king of Zeboyim, and the king of Bela (that is, Zoar).  "
"340","Genesis","14","3","All these latter kings joined forces in the Valley of Siddim (that is, the Dead Sea Valley).  "
"341","Genesis","14","4","For twelve years they had been subject to Kedorlaomer, but in the thirteenth year they rebelled. "
"342","Genesis","14","5","In the fourteenth year, Kedorlaomer and the kings allied with him went out and defeated the Rephaites in Ashteroth Karnaim, the Zuzites in Ham, the Emites in Shaveh Kiriathaim  "
"343","Genesis","14","6","and the Horites in the hill country of Seir, as far as El Paran near the desert.  "
"344","Genesis","14","7","Then they turned back and went to En Mishpat (that is, Kadesh), and they conquered the whole territory of the Amalekites, as well as the Amorites who were living in Hazezon Tamar. "
"345","Genesis","14","8","Then the king of Sodom, the king of Gomorrah, the king of Admah, the king of Zeboyim and the king of Bela (that is, Zoar) marched out and drew up their battle lines in the Valley of Siddim  "
"346","Genesis","14","9","against Kedorlaomer king of Elam, Tidal king of Goyim, Amraphel king of Shinar and Arioch king of Ellasar—four kings against five.  "
"347","Genesis","14","10","Now the Valley of Siddim was full of tar pits, and when the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, some of the men fell into them and the rest fled to the hills.  "
"348","Genesis","14","11","The four kings seized all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah and all their food; then they went away.  "
"349","Genesis","14","12","They also carried off Abram’s nephew Lot and his possessions, since he was living in Sodom. "
"350","Genesis","14","13","A man who had escaped came and reported this to Abram the Hebrew. Now Abram was living near the great trees of Mamre the Amorite, a brother  of Eshkol and Aner, all of whom were allied with Abram.  "
"351","Genesis","14","14","When Abram heard that his relative had been taken captive, he called out the 318 trained men born in his household and went in pursuit as far as Dan.  "
"352","Genesis","14","15","During the night Abram divided his men to attack them and he routed them, pursuing them as far as Hobah, north of Damascus.  "
"353","Genesis","14","16","He recovered all the goods and brought back his relative Lot and his possessions, together with the women and the other people. "
"354","Genesis","14","17","After Abram returned from defeating Kedorlaomer and the kings allied with him, the king of Sodom came out to meet him in the Valley of Shaveh (that is, the King’s Valley). "
"355","Genesis","14","18","Then Melchizedek king of Salem brought out bread and wine. He was priest of God Most High,  "
"356","Genesis","14","19","and he blessed Abram, saying, “Blessed be Abram by God Most High, Creator of heaven and earth. "
"357","Genesis","14","20","And praise be to God Most High, who delivered your enemies into your hand.” Then Abram gave him a tenth of everything. "
"358","Genesis","14","21","The king of Sodom said to Abram, “Give me the people and keep the goods for yourself.” "
"359","Genesis","14","22","But Abram said to the king of Sodom, “With raised hand I have sworn an oath to the  Lord , God Most High, Creator of heaven and earth,  "
"360","Genesis","14","23","that I will accept nothing belonging to you, not even a thread or the strap of a sandal, so that you will never be able to say, ‘I made Abram rich.’  "
"361","Genesis","14","24","I will accept nothing but what my men have eaten and the share that belongs to the men who went with me—to Aner, Eshkol and Mamre. Let them have their share.”"
"362","Genesis","15","1","After this, the word of the  Lord  came to Abram in a vision: “Do not be afraid, Abram. I am your shield, your very great reward. ” "
"363","Genesis","15","2","But Abram said, “Sovereign  Lord , what can you give me since I remain childless and the one who will inherit  my estate is Eliezer of Damascus?”  "
"364","Genesis","15","3","And Abram said, “You have given me no children; so a servant in my household will be my heir.” "
"365","Genesis","15","4","Then the word of the  Lord  came to him: “This man will not be your heir, but a son who is your own flesh and blood will be your heir.”  "
"366","Genesis","15","5","He took him outside and said, “Look up at the sky and count the stars—if indeed you can count them.” Then he said to him, “So shall your offspring  be.” "
"367","Genesis","15","6","Abram believed the  Lord , and he credited it to him as righteousness. "
"368","Genesis","15","7","He also said to him, “I am the  Lord , who brought you out of Ur of the Chaldeans to give you this land to take possession of it.” "
"369","Genesis","15","8","But Abram said, “Sovereign  Lord , how can I know that I will gain possession of it?” "
"370","Genesis","15","9","So the  Lord  said to him, “Bring me a heifer, a goat and a ram, each three years old, along with a dove and a young pigeon.” "
"371","Genesis","15","10","Abram brought all these to him, cut them in two and arranged the halves opposite each other; the birds, however, he did not cut in half.  "
"372","Genesis","15","11","Then birds of prey came down on the carcasses, but Abram drove them away. "
"373","Genesis","15","12","As the sun was setting, Abram fell into a deep sleep, and a thick and dreadful darkness came over him.  "
"374","Genesis","15","13","Then the  Lord  said to him, “Know for certain that for four hundred years your descendants will be strangers in a country not their own and that they will be enslaved and mistreated there.  "
"375","Genesis","15","14","But I will punish the nation they serve as slaves, and afterward they will come out with great possessions.  "
"376","Genesis","15","15","You, however, will go to your ancestors in peace and be buried at a good old age.  "
"377","Genesis","15","16","In the fourth generation your descendants will come back here, for the sin of the Amorites has not yet reached its full measure.” "
"378","Genesis","15","17","When the sun had set and darkness had fallen, a smoking firepot with a blazing torch appeared and passed between the pieces.  "
"379","Genesis","15","18","On that day the  Lord  made a covenant with Abram and said, “To your descendants I give this land, from the Wadi  of Egypt to the great river, the Euphrates—  "
"380","Genesis","15","19","the land of the Kenites, Kenizzites, Kadmonites,  "
"381","Genesis","15","20","Hittites, Perizzites, Rephaites,  "
"382","Genesis","15","21","Amorites, Canaanites, Girgashites and Jebusites.”"
"383","Genesis","16","1","Now Sarai, Abram’s wife, had borne him no children. But she had an Egyptian slave named Hagar;  "
"384","Genesis","16","2","so she said to Abram, “The  Lord  has kept me from having children. Go, sleep with my slave; perhaps I can build a family through her.” Abram agreed to what Sarai said.  "
"385","Genesis","16","3","So after Abram had been living in Canaan ten years, Sarai his wife took her Egyptian slave Hagar and gave her to her husband to be his wife.  "
"386","Genesis","16","4","He slept with Hagar, and she conceived. When she knew she was pregnant, she began to despise her mistress.  "
"387","Genesis","16","5","Then Sarai said to Abram, “You are responsible for the wrong I am suffering. I put my slave in your arms, and now that she knows she is pregnant, she despises me. May the  Lord  judge between you and me.” "
"388","Genesis","16","6","“Your slave is in your hands,” Abram said. “Do with her whatever you think best.” Then Sarai mistreated Hagar; so she fled from her. "
"389","Genesis","16","7","The angel of the  Lord  found Hagar near a spring in the desert; it was the spring that is beside the road to Shur.  "
"390","Genesis","16","8","And he said, “Hagar, slave of Sarai, where have you come from, and where are you going?” “I’m running away from my mistress Sarai,” she answered. "
"391","Genesis","16","9","Then the angel of the  Lord  told her, “Go back to your mistress and submit to her.”  "
"392","Genesis","16","10","The angel added, “I will increase your descendants so much that they will be too numerous to count.” "
"393","Genesis","16","11","The angel of the  Lord  also said to her: “You are now pregnant and you will give birth to a son. You shall name him Ishmael, for the  Lord  has heard of your misery. "
"394","Genesis","16","12","He will be a wild donkey of a man; his hand will be against everyone and everyone’s hand against him, and he will live in hostility toward  all his brothers.” "
"395","Genesis","16","13","She gave this name to the  Lord  who spoke to her: “You are the God who sees me,” for she said, “I have now seen  the One who sees me.”  "
"396","Genesis","16","14","That is why the well was called Beer Lahai Roi ; it is still there, between Kadesh and Bered. "
"397","Genesis","16","15","So Hagar bore Abram a son, and Abram gave the name Ishmael to the son she had borne.  "
"398","Genesis","16","16","Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore him Ishmael."
"399","Genesis","17","1","When Abram was ninety-nine years old, the  Lord  appeared to him and said, “I am God Almighty ; walk before me faithfully and be blameless.  "
"400","Genesis","17","2","Then I will make my covenant between me and you and will greatly increase your numbers.” "
"401","Genesis","17","3","Abram fell facedown, and God said to him,  "
"402","Genesis","17","4","“As for me, this is my covenant with you: You will be the father of many nations.  "
"403","Genesis","17","5","No longer will you be called Abram ; your name will be Abraham,  for I have made you a father of many nations.  "
"404","Genesis","17","6","I will make you very fruitful; I will make nations of you, and kings will come from you.  "
"405","Genesis","17","7","I will establish my covenant as an everlasting covenant between me and you and your descendants after you for the generations to come, to be your God and the God of your descendants after you.  "
"406","Genesis","17","8","The whole land of Canaan, where you now reside as a foreigner, I will give as an everlasting possession to you and your descendants after you; and I will be their God.” "
"407","Genesis","17","9","Then God said to Abraham, “As for you, you must keep my covenant, you and your descendants after you for the generations to come.  "
"408","Genesis","17","10","This is my covenant with you and your descendants after you, the covenant you are to keep: Every male among you shall be circumcised.  "
"409","Genesis","17","11","You are to undergo circumcision, and it will be the sign of the covenant between me and you.  "
"410","Genesis","17","12","For the generations to come every male among you who is eight days old must be circumcised, including those born in your household or bought with money from a foreigner—those who are not your offspring.  "
"411","Genesis","17","13","Whether born in your household or bought with your money, they must be circumcised. My covenant in your flesh is to be an everlasting covenant.  "
"412","Genesis","17","14","Any uncircumcised male, who has not been circumcised in the flesh, will be cut off from his people; he has broken my covenant.” "
"413","Genesis","17","15","God also said to Abraham, “As for Sarai your wife, you are no longer to call her Sarai; her name will be Sarah.  "
"414","Genesis","17","16","I will bless her and will surely give you a son by her. I will bless her so that she will be the mother of nations; kings of peoples will come from her.” "
"415","Genesis","17","17","Abraham fell facedown; he laughed and said to himself, “Will a son be born to a man a hundred years old? Will Sarah bear a child at the age of ninety?”  "
"416","Genesis","17","18","And Abraham said to God, “If only Ishmael might live under your blessing!” "
"417","Genesis","17","19","Then God said, “Yes, but your wife Sarah will bear you a son, and you will call him Isaac.  I will establish my covenant with him as an everlasting covenant for his descendants after him.  "
"418","Genesis","17","20","And as for Ishmael, I have heard you: I will surely bless him; I will make him fruitful and will greatly increase his numbers. He will be the father of twelve rulers, and I will make him into a great nation.  "
"419","Genesis","17","21","But my covenant I will establish with Isaac, whom Sarah will bear to you by this time next year.”  "
"420","Genesis","17","22","When he had finished speaking with Abraham, God went up from him. "
"421","Genesis","17","23","On that very day Abraham took his son Ishmael and all those born in his household or bought with his money, every male in his household, and circumcised them, as God told him.  "
"422","Genesis","17","24","Abraham was ninety-nine years old when he was circumcised,  "
"423","Genesis","17","25","and his son Ishmael was thirteen;  "
"424","Genesis","17","26","Abraham and his son Ishmael were both circumcised on that very day.  "
"425","Genesis","17","27","And every male in Abraham’s household, including those born in his household or bought from a foreigner, was circumcised with him."
"426","Genesis","18","1","The  Lord  appeared to Abraham near the great trees of Mamre while he was sitting at the entrance to his tent in the heat of the day.  "
"427","Genesis","18","2","Abraham looked up and saw three men standing nearby. When he saw them, he hurried from the entrance of his tent to meet them and bowed low to the ground. "
"428","Genesis","18","3","He said, “If I have found favor in your eyes, my lord,  do not pass your servant by.  "
"429","Genesis","18","4","Let a little water be brought, and then you may all wash your feet and rest under this tree.  "
"430","Genesis","18","5","Let me get you something to eat, so you can be refreshed and then go on your way—now that you have come to your servant.” “Very well,” they answered, “do as you say.” "
"431","Genesis","18","6","So Abraham hurried into the tent to Sarah. “Quick,” he said, “get three seahs  of the finest flour and knead it and bake some bread.” "
"432","Genesis","18","7","Then he ran to the herd and selected a choice, tender calf and gave it to a servant, who hurried to prepare it.  "
"433","Genesis","18","8","He then brought some curds and milk and the calf that had been prepared, and set these before them. While they ate, he stood near them under a tree. "
"434","Genesis","18","9","“Where is your wife Sarah?” they asked him. “There, in the tent,” he said. "
"435","Genesis","18","10","Then one of them said, “I will surely return to you about this time next year, and Sarah your wife will have a son.” Now Sarah was listening at the entrance to the tent, which was behind him.  "
"436","Genesis","18","11","Abraham and Sarah were already very old, and Sarah was past the age of childbearing.  "
"437","Genesis","18","12","So Sarah laughed to herself as she thought, “After I am worn out and my lord is old, will I now have this pleasure?” "
"438","Genesis","18","13","Then the  Lord  said to Abraham, “Why did Sarah laugh and say, ‘Will I really have a child, now that I am old?’  "
"439","Genesis","18","14","Is anything too hard for the  Lord ? I will return to you at the appointed time next year, and Sarah will have a son.” "
"440","Genesis","18","15","Sarah was afraid, so she lied and said, “I did not laugh.” But he said, “Yes, you did laugh.” "
"441","Genesis","18","16","When the men got up to leave, they looked down toward Sodom, and Abraham walked along with them to see them on their way.  "
"442","Genesis","18","17","Then the  Lord  said, “Shall I hide from Abraham what I am about to do?  "
"443","Genesis","18","18","Abraham will surely become a great and powerful nation, and all nations on earth will be blessed through him.   "
"444","Genesis","18","19","For I have chosen him, so that he will direct his children and his household after him to keep the way of the  Lord  by doing what is right and just, so that the  Lord  will bring about for Abraham what he has promised him.” "
"445","Genesis","18","20","Then the  Lord  said, “The outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is so great and their sin so grievous  "
"446","Genesis","18","21","that I will go down and see if what they have done is as bad as the outcry that has reached me. If not, I will know.” "
"447","Genesis","18","22","The men turned away and went toward Sodom, but Abraham remained standing before the  Lord .   "
"448","Genesis","18","23","Then Abraham approached him and said: “Will you sweep away the righteous with the wicked?  "
"449","Genesis","18","24","What if there are fifty righteous people in the city? Will you really sweep it away and not spare  the place for the sake of the fifty righteous people in it?  "
"450","Genesis","18","25","Far be it from you to do such a thing—to kill the righteous with the wicked, treating the righteous and the wicked alike. Far be it from you! Will not the Judge of all the earth do right?” "
"451","Genesis","18","26","The  Lord  said, “If I find fifty righteous people in the city of Sodom, I will spare the whole place for their sake.” "
"452","Genesis","18","27","Then Abraham spoke up again: “Now that I have been so bold as to speak to the Lord, though I am nothing but dust and ashes,  "
"453","Genesis","18","28","what if the number of the righteous is five less than fifty? Will you destroy the whole city for lack of five people?” “If I find forty-five there,” he said, “I will not destroy it.” "
"454","Genesis","18","29","Once again he spoke to him, “What if only forty are found there?” He said, “For the sake of forty, I will not do it.” "
"455","Genesis","18","30","Then he said, “May the Lord not be angry, but let me speak. What if only thirty can be found there?” He answered, “I will not do it if I find thirty there.” "
"456","Genesis","18","31","Abraham said, “Now that I have been so bold as to speak to the Lord, what if only twenty can be found there?” He said, “For the sake of twenty, I will not destroy it.” "
"457","Genesis","18","32","Then he said, “May the Lord not be angry, but let me speak just once more. What if only ten can be found there?” He answered, “For the sake of ten, I will not destroy it.” "
"458","Genesis","18","33","When the  Lord  had finished speaking with Abraham, he left, and Abraham returned home."
"459","Genesis","19","1","The two angels arrived at Sodom in the evening, and Lot was sitting in the gateway of the city. When he saw them, he got up to meet them and bowed down with his face to the ground.  "
"460","Genesis","19","2","“My lords,” he said, “please turn aside to your servant’s house. You can wash your feet and spend the night and then go on your way early in the morning.” “No,” they answered, “we will spend the night in the square.” "
"461","Genesis","19","3","But he insisted so strongly that they did go with him and entered his house. He prepared a meal for them, baking bread without yeast, and they ate.  "
"462","Genesis","19","4","Before they had gone to bed, all the men from every part of the city of Sodom—both young and old—surrounded the house.  "
"463","Genesis","19","5","They called to Lot, “Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us so that we can have sex with them.” "
"464","Genesis","19","6","Lot went outside to meet them and shut the door behind him  "
"465","Genesis","19","7","and said, “No, my friends. Don’t do this wicked thing.  "
"466","Genesis","19","8","Look, I have two daughters who have never slept with a man. Let me bring them out to you, and you can do what you like with them. But don’t do anything to these men, for they have come under the protection of my roof.” "
"467","Genesis","19","9","“Get out of our way,” they replied. “This fellow came here as a foreigner, and now he wants to play the judge! We’ll treat you worse than them.” They kept bringing pressure on Lot and moved forward to break down the door. "
"468","Genesis","19","10","But the men inside reached out and pulled Lot back into the house and shut the door.  "
"469","Genesis","19","11","Then they struck the men who were at the door of the house, young and old, with blindness so that they could not find the door. "
"470","Genesis","19","12","The two men said to Lot, “Do you have anyone else here—sons-in-law, sons or daughters, or anyone else in the city who belongs to you? Get them out of here,  "
"471","Genesis","19","13","because we are going to destroy this place. The outcry to the  Lord  against its people is so great that he has sent us to destroy it.” "
"472","Genesis","19","14","So Lot went out and spoke to his sons-in-law, who were pledged to marry  his daughters. He said, “Hurry and get out of this place, because the  Lord  is about to destroy the city!” But his sons-in-law thought he was joking. "
"473","Genesis","19","15","With the coming of dawn, the angels urged Lot, saying, “Hurry! Take your wife and your two daughters who are here, or you will be swept away when the city is punished.” "
"474","Genesis","19","16","When he hesitated, the men grasped his hand and the hands of his wife and of his two daughters and led them safely out of the city, for the  Lord  was merciful to them.  "
"475","Genesis","19","17","As soon as they had brought them out, one of them said, “Flee for your lives! Don’t look back, and don’t stop anywhere in the plain! Flee to the mountains or you will be swept away!” "
"476","Genesis","19","18","But Lot said to them, “No, my lords,  please!  "
"477","Genesis","19","19","Your  servant has found favor in your  eyes, and you  have shown great kindness to me in sparing my life. But I can’t flee to the mountains; this disaster will overtake me, and I’ll die.  "
"478","Genesis","19","20","Look, here is a town near enough to run to, and it is small. Let me flee to it—it is very small, isn’t it? Then my life will be spared.” "
"479","Genesis","19","21","He said to him, “Very well, I will grant this request too; I will not overthrow the town you speak of.  "
"480","Genesis","19","22","But flee there quickly, because I cannot do anything until you reach it.” (That is why the town was called Zoar. ) "
"481","Genesis","19","23","By the time Lot reached Zoar, the sun had risen over the land.  "
"482","Genesis","19","24","Then the  Lord  rained down burning sulfur on Sodom and Gomorrah—from the  Lord  out of the heavens.  "
"483","Genesis","19","25","Thus he overthrew those cities and the entire plain, destroying all those living in the cities—and also the vegetation in the land.  "
"484","Genesis","19","26","But Lot’s wife looked back, and she became a pillar of salt. "
"485","Genesis","19","27","Early the next morning Abraham got up and returned to the place where he had stood before the  Lord .  "
"486","Genesis","19","28","He looked down toward Sodom and Gomorrah, toward all the land of the plain, and he saw dense smoke rising from the land, like smoke from a furnace. "
"487","Genesis","19","29","So when God destroyed the cities of the plain, he remembered Abraham, and he brought Lot out of the catastrophe that overthrew the cities where Lot had lived. "
"488","Genesis","19","30","Lot and his two daughters left Zoar and settled in the mountains, for he was afraid to stay in Zoar. He and his two daughters lived in a cave.  "
"489","Genesis","19","31","One day the older daughter said to the younger, “Our father is old, and there is no man around here to give us children—as is the custom all over the earth.  "
"490","Genesis","19","32","Let’s get our father to drink wine and then sleep with him and preserve our family line through our father.” "
"491","Genesis","19","33","That night they got their father to drink wine, and the older daughter went in and slept with him. He was not aware of it when she lay down or when she got up. "
"492","Genesis","19","34","The next day the older daughter said to the younger, “Last night I slept with my father. Let’s get him to drink wine again tonight, and you go in and sleep with him so we can preserve our family line through our father.”  "
"493","Genesis","19","35","So they got their father to drink wine that night also, and the younger daughter went in and slept with him. Again he was not aware of it when she lay down or when she got up. "
"494","Genesis","19","36","So both of Lot’s daughters became pregnant by their father.  "
"495","Genesis","19","37","The older daughter had a son, and she named him Moab ; he is the father of the Moabites of today.  "
"496","Genesis","19","38","The younger daughter also had a son, and she named him Ben-Ammi ; he is the father of the Ammonites  of today."
"497","Genesis","20","1","Now Abraham moved on from there into the region of the Negev and lived between Kadesh and Shur. For a while he stayed in Gerar,  "
"498","Genesis","20","2","and there Abraham said of his wife Sarah, “She is my sister.” Then Abimelek king of Gerar sent for Sarah and took her. "
"499","Genesis","20","3","But God came to Abimelek in a dream one night and said to him, “You are as good as dead because of the woman you have taken; she is a married woman.” "
"500","Genesis","20","4","Now Abimelek had not gone near her, so he said, “Lord, will you destroy an innocent nation?  "
"501","Genesis","20","5","Did he not say to me, ‘She is my sister,’ and didn’t she also say, ‘He is my brother’? I have done this with a clear conscience and clean hands.” "
"502","Genesis","20","6","Then God said to him in the dream, “Yes, I know you did this with a clear conscience, and so I have kept you from sinning against me. That is why I did not let you touch her.  "
"503","Genesis","20","7","Now return the man’s wife, for he is a prophet, and he will pray for you and you will live. But if you do not return her, you may be sure that you and all who belong to you will die.” "
"504","Genesis","20","8","Early the next morning Abimelek summoned all his officials, and when he told them all that had happened, they were very much afraid.  "
"505","Genesis","20","9","Then Abimelek called Abraham in and said, “What have you done to us? How have I wronged you that you have brought such great guilt upon me and my kingdom? You have done things to me that should never be done.”  "
"506","Genesis","20","10","And Abimelek asked Abraham, “What was your reason for doing this?” "
"507","Genesis","20","11","Abraham replied, “I said to myself, ‘There is surely no fear of God in this place, and they will kill me because of my wife.’  "
"508","Genesis","20","12","Besides, she really is my sister, the daughter of my father though not of my mother; and she became my wife.  "
"509","Genesis","20","13","And when God had me wander from my father’s household, I said to her, ‘This is how you can show your love to me: Everywhere we go, say of me, “He is my brother.” ’ ” "
"510","Genesis","20","14","Then Abimelek brought sheep and cattle and male and female slaves and gave them to Abraham, and he returned Sarah his wife to him.  "
"511","Genesis","20","15","And Abimelek said, “My land is before you; live wherever you like.” "
"512","Genesis","20","16","To Sarah he said, “I am giving your brother a thousand shekels  of silver. This is to cover the offense against you before all who are with you; you are completely vindicated.” "
"513","Genesis","20","17","Then Abraham prayed to God, and God healed Abimelek, his wife and his female slaves so they could have children again,  "
"514","Genesis","20","18","for the  Lord  had kept all the women in Abimelek’s household from conceiving because of Abraham’s wife Sarah."
"515","Genesis","21","1","Now the  Lord  was gracious to Sarah as he had said, and the  Lord  did for Sarah what he had promised.  "
"516","Genesis","21","2","Sarah became pregnant and bore a son to Abraham in his old age, at the very time God had promised him.  "
"517","Genesis","21","3","Abraham gave the name Isaac  to the son Sarah bore him.  "
"518","Genesis","21","4","When his son Isaac was eight days old, Abraham circumcised him, as God commanded him.  "
"519","Genesis","21","5","Abraham was a hundred years old when his son Isaac was born to him. "
"520","Genesis","21","6","Sarah said, “God has brought me laughter, and everyone who hears about this will laugh with me.”  "
"521","Genesis","21","7","And she added, “Who would have said to Abraham that Sarah would nurse children? Yet I have borne him a son in his old age.” "
"522","Genesis","21","8","The child grew and was weaned, and on the day Isaac was weaned Abraham held a great feast.  "
"523","Genesis","21","9","But Sarah saw that the son whom Hagar the Egyptian had borne to Abraham was mocking,  "
"524","Genesis","21","10","and she said to Abraham, “Get rid of that slave woman and her son, for that woman’s son will never share in the inheritance with my son Isaac.” "
"525","Genesis","21","11","The matter distressed Abraham greatly because it concerned his son.  "
"526","Genesis","21","12","But God said to him, “Do not be so distressed about the boy and your slave woman. Listen to whatever Sarah tells you, because it is through Isaac that your offspring  will be reckoned.  "
"527","Genesis","21","13","I will make the son of the slave into a nation also, because he is your offspring.” "
"528","Genesis","21","14","Early the next morning Abraham took some food and a skin of water and gave them to Hagar. He set them on her shoulders and then sent her off with the boy. She went on her way and wandered in the Desert of Beersheba. "
"529","Genesis","21","15","When the water in the skin was gone, she put the boy under one of the bushes.  "
"530","Genesis","21","16","Then she went off and sat down about a bowshot away, for she thought, “I cannot watch the boy die.” And as she sat there, she  began to sob. "
"531","Genesis","21","17","God heard the boy crying, and the angel of God called to Hagar from heaven and said to her, “What is the matter, Hagar? Do not be afraid; God has heard the boy crying as he lies there.  "
"532","Genesis","21","18","Lift the boy up and take him by the hand, for I will make him into a great nation.” "
"533","Genesis","21","19","Then God opened her eyes and she saw a well of water. So she went and filled the skin with water and gave the boy a drink. "
"534","Genesis","21","20","God was with the boy as he grew up. He lived in the desert and became an archer.  "
"535","Genesis","21","21","While he was living in the Desert of Paran, his mother got a wife for him from Egypt. "
"536","Genesis","21","22","At that time Abimelek and Phicol the commander of his forces said to Abraham, “God is with you in everything you do.  "
"537","Genesis","21","23","Now swear to me here before God that you will not deal falsely with me or my children or my descendants. Show to me and the country where you now reside as a foreigner the same kindness I have shown to you.” "
"538","Genesis","21","24","Abraham said, “I swear it.” "
"539","Genesis","21","25","Then Abraham complained to Abimelek about a well of water that Abimelek’s servants had seized.  "
"540","Genesis","21","26","But Abimelek said, “I don’t know who has done this. You did not tell me, and I heard about it only today.” "
"541","Genesis","21","27","So Abraham brought sheep and cattle and gave them to Abimelek, and the two men made a treaty.  "
"542","Genesis","21","28","Abraham set apart seven ewe lambs from the flock,  "
"543","Genesis","21","29","and Abimelek asked Abraham, “What is the meaning of these seven ewe lambs you have set apart by themselves?” "
"544","Genesis","21","30","He replied, “Accept these seven lambs from my hand as a witness that I dug this well.” "
"545","Genesis","21","31","So that place was called Beersheba,  because the two men swore an oath there. "
"546","Genesis","21","32","After the treaty had been made at Beersheba, Abimelek and Phicol the commander of his forces returned to the land of the Philistines.  "
"547","Genesis","21","33","Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beersheba, and there he called on the name of the  Lord , the Eternal God.  "
"548","Genesis","21","34","And Abraham stayed in the land of the Philistines for a long time."
"549","Genesis","22","1","Some time later God tested Abraham. He said to him, “Abraham!” “Here I am,” he replied. "
"550","Genesis","22","2","Then God said, “Take your son, your only son, whom you love—Isaac—and go to the region of Moriah. Sacrifice him there as a burnt offering on a mountain I will show you.” "
"551","Genesis","22","3","Early the next morning Abraham got up and loaded his donkey. He took with him two of his servants and his son Isaac. When he had cut enough wood for the burnt offering, he set out for the place God had told him about.  "
"552","Genesis","22","4","On the third day Abraham looked up and saw the place in the distance.  "
"553","Genesis","22","5","He said to his servants, “Stay here with the donkey while I and the boy go over there. We will worship and then we will come back to you.” "
"554","Genesis","22","6","Abraham took the wood for the burnt offering and placed it on his son Isaac, and he himself carried the fire and the knife. As the two of them went on together,  "
"555","Genesis","22","7","Isaac spoke up and said to his father Abraham, “Father?” “Yes, my son?” Abraham replied. “The fire and wood are here,” Isaac said, “but where is the lamb for the burnt offering?” "
"556","Genesis","22","8","Abraham answered, “God himself will provide the lamb for the burnt offering, my son.” And the two of them went on together. "
"557","Genesis","22","9","When they reached the place God had told him about, Abraham built an altar there and arranged the wood on it. He bound his son Isaac and laid him on the altar, on top of the wood.  "
"558","Genesis","22","10","Then he reached out his hand and took the knife to slay his son.  "
"559","Genesis","22","11","But the angel of the  Lord  called out to him from heaven, “Abraham! Abraham!” “Here I am,” he replied. "
"560","Genesis","22","12","“Do not lay a hand on the boy,” he said. “Do not do anything to him. Now I know that you fear God, because you have not withheld from me your son, your only son.” "
"561","Genesis","22","13","Abraham looked up and there in a thicket he saw a ram  caught by its horns. He went over and took the ram and sacrificed it as a burnt offering instead of his son.  "
"562","Genesis","22","14","So Abraham called that place The  Lord  Will Provide. And to this day it is said, “On the mountain of the  Lord  it will be provided.” "
"563","Genesis","22","15","The angel of the  Lord  called to Abraham from heaven a second time  "
"564","Genesis","22","16","and said, “I swear by myself, declares the  Lord , that because you have done this and have not withheld your son, your only son,  "
"565","Genesis","22","17","I will surely bless you and make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and as the sand on the seashore. Your descendants will take possession of the cities of their enemies,  "
"566","Genesis","22","18","and through your offspring  all nations on earth will be blessed,  because you have obeyed me.” "
"567","Genesis","22","19","Then Abraham returned to his servants, and they set off together for Beersheba. And Abraham stayed in Beersheba. "
"568","Genesis","22","20","Some time later Abraham was told, “Milkah is also a mother; she has borne sons to your brother Nahor:  "
"569","Genesis","22","21","Uz the firstborn, Buz his brother, Kemuel (the father of Aram),  "
"570","Genesis","22","22","Kesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph and Bethuel.”  "
"571","Genesis","22","23","Bethuel became the father of Rebekah. Milkah bore these eight sons to Abraham’s brother Nahor.  "
"572","Genesis","22","24","His concubine, whose name was Reumah, also had sons: Tebah, Gaham, Tahash and Maakah."
"573","Genesis","23","1","Sarah lived to be a hundred and twenty-seven years old.  "
"574","Genesis","23","2","She died at Kiriath Arba (that is, Hebron) in the land of Canaan, and Abraham went to mourn for Sarah and to weep over her. "
"575","Genesis","23","3","Then Abraham rose from beside his dead wife and spoke to the Hittites.  He said,  "
"576","Genesis","23","4","“I am a foreigner and stranger among you. Sell me some property for a burial site here so I can bury my dead.” "
"577","Genesis","23","5","The Hittites replied to Abraham,  "
"578","Genesis","23","6","“Sir, listen to us. You are a mighty prince among us. Bury your dead in the choicest of our tombs. None of us will refuse you his tomb for burying your dead.” "
"579","Genesis","23","7","Then Abraham rose and bowed down before the people of the land, the Hittites.  "
"580","Genesis","23","8","He said to them, “If you are willing to let me bury my dead, then listen to me and intercede with Ephron son of Zohar on my behalf  "
"581","Genesis","23","9","so he will sell me the cave of Machpelah, which belongs to him and is at the end of his field. Ask him to sell it to me for the full price as a burial site among you.” "
"582","Genesis","23","10","Ephron the Hittite was sitting among his people and he replied to Abraham in the hearing of all the Hittites who had come to the gate of his city.  "
"583","Genesis","23","11","“No, my lord,” he said. “Listen to me; I give  you the field, and I give  you the cave that is in it. I give  it to you in the presence of my people. Bury your dead.” "
"584","Genesis","23","12","Again Abraham bowed down before the people of the land  "
"585","Genesis","23","13","and he said to Ephron in their hearing, “Listen to me, if you will. I will pay the price of the field. Accept it from me so I can bury my dead there.” "
"586","Genesis","23","14","Ephron answered Abraham,  "
"587","Genesis","23","15","“Listen to me, my lord; the land is worth four hundred shekels  of silver, but what is that between you and me? Bury your dead.” "
"588","Genesis","23","16","Abraham agreed to Ephron’s terms and weighed out for him the price he had named in the hearing of the Hittites: four hundred shekels of silver, according to the weight current among the merchants. "
"589","Genesis","23","17","So Ephron’s field in Machpelah near Mamre—both the field and the cave in it, and all the trees within the borders of the field—was deeded  "
"590","Genesis","23","18","to Abraham as his property in the presence of all the Hittites who had come to the gate of the city.  "
"591","Genesis","23","19","Afterward Abraham buried his wife Sarah in the cave in the field of Machpelah near Mamre (which is at Hebron) in the land of Canaan.  "
"592","Genesis","23","20","So the field and the cave in it were deeded to Abraham by the Hittites as a burial site."
"593","Genesis","24","1","Abraham was now very old, and the  Lord  had blessed him in every way.  "
"594","Genesis","24","2","He said to the senior servant in his household, the one in charge of all that he had, “Put your hand under my thigh.  "
"595","Genesis","24","3","I want you to swear by the  Lord , the God of heaven and the God of earth, that you will not get a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I am living,  "
"596","Genesis","24","4","but will go to my country and my own relatives and get a wife for my son Isaac.” "
"597","Genesis","24","5","The servant asked him, “What if the woman is unwilling to come back with me to this land? Shall I then take your son back to the country you came from?” "
"598","Genesis","24","6","“Make sure that you do not take my son back there,” Abraham said.  "
"599","Genesis","24","7","“The  Lord , the God of heaven, who brought me out of my father’s household and my native land and who spoke to me and promised me on oath, saying, ‘To your offspring  I will give this land’—he will send his angel before you so that you can get a wife for my son from there.  "
"600","Genesis","24","8","If the woman is unwilling to come back with you, then you will be released from this oath of mine. Only do not take my son back there.”  "
"601","Genesis","24","9","So the servant put his hand under the thigh of his master Abraham and swore an oath to him concerning this matter. "
"602","Genesis","24","10","Then the servant left, taking with him ten of his master’s camels loaded with all kinds of good things from his master. He set out for Aram Naharaim  and made his way to the town of Nahor.  "
"603","Genesis","24","11","He had the camels kneel down near the well outside the town; it was toward evening, the time the women go out to draw water. "
"604","Genesis","24","12","Then he prayed, “ Lord , God of my master Abraham, make me successful today, and show kindness to my master Abraham.  "
"605","Genesis","24","13","See, I am standing beside this spring, and the daughters of the townspeople are coming out to draw water.  "
"606","Genesis","24","14","May it be that when I say to a young woman, ‘Please let down your jar that I may have a drink,’ and she says, ‘Drink, and I’ll water your camels too’—let her be the one you have chosen for your servant Isaac. By this I will know that you have shown kindness to my master.” "
"607","Genesis","24","15","Before he had finished praying, Rebekah came out with her jar on her shoulder. She was the daughter of Bethuel son of Milkah, who was the wife of Abraham’s brother Nahor.  "
"608","Genesis","24","16","The woman was very beautiful, a virgin; no man had ever slept with her. She went down to the spring, filled her jar and came up again. "
"609","Genesis","24","17","The servant hurried to meet her and said, “Please give me a little water from your jar.” "
"610","Genesis","24","18","“Drink, my lord,” she said, and quickly lowered the jar to her hands and gave him a drink. "
"611","Genesis","24","19","After she had given him a drink, she said, “I’ll draw water for your camels too, until they have had enough to drink.”  "
"612","Genesis","24","20","So she quickly emptied her jar into the trough, ran back to the well to draw more water, and drew enough for all his camels.  "
"613","Genesis","24","21","Without saying a word, the man watched her closely to learn whether or not the  Lord  had made his journey successful. "
"614","Genesis","24","22","When the camels had finished drinking, the man took out a gold nose ring weighing a beka  and two gold bracelets weighing ten shekels.   "
"615","Genesis","24","23","Then he asked, “Whose daughter are you? Please tell me, is there room in your father’s house for us to spend the night?” "
"616","Genesis","24","24","She answered him, “I am the daughter of Bethuel, the son that Milkah bore to Nahor.”  "
"617","Genesis","24","25","And she added, “We have plenty of straw and fodder, as well as room for you to spend the night.” "
"618","Genesis","24","26","Then the man bowed down and worshiped the  Lord ,  "
"619","Genesis","24","27","saying, “Praise be to the  Lord , the God of my master Abraham, who has not abandoned his kindness and faithfulness to my master. As for me, the  Lord  has led me on the journey to the house of my master’s relatives.” "
"620","Genesis","24","28","The young woman ran and told her mother’s household about these things.  "
"621","Genesis","24","29","Now Rebekah had a brother named Laban, and he hurried out to the man at the spring.  "
"622","Genesis","24","30","As soon as he had seen the nose ring, and the bracelets on his sister’s arms, and had heard Rebekah tell what the man said to her, he went out to the man and found him standing by the camels near the spring.  "
"623","Genesis","24","31","“Come, you who are blessed by the  Lord ,” he said. “Why are you standing out here? I have prepared the house and a place for the camels.” "
"624","Genesis","24","32","So the man went to the house, and the camels were unloaded. Straw and fodder were brought for the camels, and water for him and his men to wash their feet.  "
"625","Genesis","24","33","Then food was set before him, but he said, “I will not eat until I have told you what I have to say.” “Then tell us,” Laban said. "
"626","Genesis","24","34","So he said, “I am Abraham’s servant.  "
"627","Genesis","24","35","The  Lord  has blessed my master abundantly, and he has become wealthy. He has given him sheep and cattle, silver and gold, male and female servants, and camels and donkeys.  "
"628","Genesis","24","36","My master’s wife Sarah has borne him a son in her old age, and he has given him everything he owns.  "
"629","Genesis","24","37","And my master made me swear an oath, and said, ‘You must not get a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I live,  "
"630","Genesis","24","38","but go to my father’s family and to my own clan, and get a wife for my son.’ "
"631","Genesis","24","39","“Then I asked my master, ‘What if the woman will not come back with me?’ "
"632","Genesis","24","40","“He replied, ‘The  Lord , before whom I have walked faithfully, will send his angel with you and make your journey a success, so that you can get a wife for my son from my own clan and from my father’s family.  "
"633","Genesis","24","41","You will be released from my oath if, when you go to my clan, they refuse to give her to you—then you will be released from my oath.’ "
"634","Genesis","24","42","“When I came to the spring today, I said, ‘ Lord , God of my master Abraham, if you will, please grant success to the journey on which I have come.  "
"635","Genesis","24","43","See, I am standing beside this spring. If a young woman comes out to draw water and I say to her, “Please let me drink a little water from your jar,”  "
"636","Genesis","24","44","and if she says to me, “Drink, and I’ll draw water for your camels too,” let her be the one the  Lord  has chosen for my master’s son.’ "
"637","Genesis","24","45","“Before I finished praying in my heart, Rebekah came out, with her jar on her shoulder. She went down to the spring and drew water, and I said to her, ‘Please give me a drink.’ "
"638","Genesis","24","46","“She quickly lowered her jar from her shoulder and said, ‘Drink, and I’ll water your camels too.’ So I drank, and she watered the camels also. "
"639","Genesis","24","47","“I asked her, ‘Whose daughter are you?’ “She said, ‘The daughter of Bethuel son of Nahor, whom Milkah bore to him.’ “Then I put the ring in her nose and the bracelets on her arms,  "
"640","Genesis","24","48","and I bowed down and worshiped the  Lord . I praised the  Lord , the God of my master Abraham, who had led me on the right road to get the granddaughter of my master’s brother for his son.  "
"641","Genesis","24","49","Now if you will show kindness and faithfulness to my master, tell me; and if not, tell me, so I may know which way to turn.” "
"642","Genesis","24","50","Laban and Bethuel answered, “This is from the  Lord ; we can say nothing to you one way or the other.  "
"643","Genesis","24","51","Here is Rebekah; take her and go, and let her become the wife of your master’s son, as the  Lord  has directed.” "
"644","Genesis","24","52","When Abraham’s servant heard what they said, he bowed down to the ground before the  Lord .  "
"645","Genesis","24","53","Then the servant brought out gold and silver jewelry and articles of clothing and gave them to Rebekah; he also gave costly gifts to her brother and to her mother.  "
"646","Genesis","24","54","Then he and the men who were with him ate and drank and spent the night there. When they got up the next morning, he said, “Send me on my way to my master.” "
"647","Genesis","24","55","But her brother and her mother replied, “Let the young woman remain with us ten days or so; then you  may go.” "
"648","Genesis","24","56","But he said to them, “Do not detain me, now that the  Lord  has granted success to my journey. Send me on my way so I may go to my master.” "
"649","Genesis","24","57","Then they said, “Let’s call the young woman and ask her about it.”  "
"650","Genesis","24","58","So they called Rebekah and asked her, “Will you go with this man?” “I will go,” she said. "
"651","Genesis","24","59","So they sent their sister Rebekah on her way, along with her nurse and Abraham’s servant and his men.  "
"652","Genesis","24","60","And they blessed Rebekah and said to her, “Our sister, may you increase to thousands upon thousands; may your offspring possess the cities of their enemies.” "
"653","Genesis","24","61","Then Rebekah and her attendants got ready and mounted the camels and went back with the man. So the servant took Rebekah and left. "
"654","Genesis","24","62","Now Isaac had come from Beer Lahai Roi, for he was living in the Negev.  "
"655","Genesis","24","63","He went out to the field one evening to meditate,  and as he looked up, he saw camels approaching.  "
"656","Genesis","24","64","Rebekah also looked up and saw Isaac. She got down from her camel  "
"657","Genesis","24","65","and asked the servant, “Who is that man in the field coming to meet us?” “He is my master,” the servant answered. So she took her veil and covered herself. "
"658","Genesis","24","66","Then the servant told Isaac all he had done.  "
"659","Genesis","24","67","Isaac brought her into the tent of his mother Sarah, and he married Rebekah. So she became his wife, and he loved her; and Isaac was comforted after his mother’s death."
"660","Genesis","25","1","Abraham had taken another wife, whose name was Keturah.  "
"661","Genesis","25","2","She bore him Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak and Shuah.  "
"662","Genesis","25","3","Jokshan was the father of Sheba and Dedan; the descendants of Dedan were the Ashurites, the Letushites and the Leummites.  "
"663","Genesis","25","4","The sons of Midian were Ephah, Epher, Hanok, Abida and Eldaah. All these were descendants of Keturah. "
"664","Genesis","25","5","Abraham left everything he owned to Isaac.  "
"665","Genesis","25","6","But while he was still living, he gave gifts to the sons of his concubines and sent them away from his son Isaac to the land of the east. "
"666","Genesis","25","7","Abraham lived a hundred and seventy-five years.  "
"667","Genesis","25","8","Then Abraham breathed his last and died at a good old age, an old man and full of years; and he was gathered to his people.  "
"668","Genesis","25","9","His sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah near Mamre, in the field of Ephron son of Zohar the Hittite,  "
"669","Genesis","25","10","the field Abraham had bought from the Hittites.  There Abraham was buried with his wife Sarah.  "
"670","Genesis","25","11","After Abraham’s death, God blessed his son Isaac, who then lived near Beer Lahai Roi. "
"671","Genesis","25","12","This is the account of the family line of Abraham’s son Ishmael, whom Sarah’s slave, Hagar the Egyptian, bore to Abraham. "
"672","Genesis","25","13","These are the names of the sons of Ishmael, listed in the order of their birth: Nebaioth the firstborn of Ishmael, Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam,  "
"673","Genesis","25","14","Mishma, Dumah, Massa,  "
"674","Genesis","25","15","Hadad, Tema, Jetur, Naphish and Kedemah.  "
"675","Genesis","25","16","These were the sons of Ishmael, and these are the names of the twelve tribal rulers according to their settlements and camps.  "
"676","Genesis","25","17","Ishmael lived a hundred and thirty-seven years. He breathed his last and died, and he was gathered to his people.  "
"677","Genesis","25","18","His descendants settled in the area from Havilah to Shur, near the eastern border of Egypt, as you go toward Ashur. And they lived in hostility toward  all the tribes related to them. "
"678","Genesis","25","19","This is the account of the family line of Abraham’s son Isaac. Abraham became the father of Isaac,  "
"679","Genesis","25","20","and Isaac was forty years old when he married Rebekah daughter of Bethuel the Aramean from Paddan Aram  and sister of Laban the Aramean. "
"680","Genesis","25","21","Isaac prayed to the  Lord  on behalf of his wife, because she was childless. The  Lord  answered his prayer, and his wife Rebekah became pregnant.  "
"681","Genesis","25","22","The babies jostled each other within her, and she said, “Why is this happening to me?” So she went to inquire of the  Lord . "
"682","Genesis","25","23","The  Lord  said to her, “Two nations are in your womb, and two peoples from within you will be separated; one people will be stronger than the other, and the older will serve the younger.” "
"683","Genesis","25","24","When the time came for her to give birth, there were twin boys in her womb.  "
"684","Genesis","25","25","The first to come out was red, and his whole body was like a hairy garment; so they named him Esau.   "
"685","Genesis","25","26","After this, his brother came out, with his hand grasping Esau’s heel; so he was named Jacob.  Isaac was sixty years old when Rebekah gave birth to them. "
"686","Genesis","25","27","The boys grew up, and Esau became a skillful hunter, a man of the open country, while Jacob was content to stay at home among the tents.  "
"687","Genesis","25","28","Isaac, who had a taste for wild game, loved Esau, but Rebekah loved Jacob. "
"688","Genesis","25","29","Once when Jacob was cooking some stew, Esau came in from the open country, famished.  "
"689","Genesis","25","30","He said to Jacob, “Quick, let me have some of that red stew! I’m famished!” (That is why he was also called Edom. ) "
"690","Genesis","25","31","Jacob replied, “First sell me your birthright.” "
"691","Genesis","25","32","“Look, I am about to die,” Esau said. “What good is the birthright to me?” "
"692","Genesis","25","33","But Jacob said, “Swear to me first.” So he swore an oath to him, selling his birthright to Jacob. "
"693","Genesis","25","34","Then Jacob gave Esau some bread and some lentil stew. He ate and drank, and then got up and left. So Esau despised his birthright."
"694","Genesis","26","1","Now there was a famine in the land—besides the previous famine in Abraham’s time—and Isaac went to Abimelek king of the Philistines in Gerar.  "
"695","Genesis","26","2","The  Lord  appeared to Isaac and said, “Do not go down to Egypt; live in the land where I tell you to live.  "
"696","Genesis","26","3","Stay in this land for a while, and I will be with you and will bless you. For to you and your descendants I will give all these lands and will confirm the oath I swore to your father Abraham.  "
"697","Genesis","26","4","I will make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and will give them all these lands, and through your offspring  all nations on earth will be blessed,   "
"698","Genesis","26","5","because Abraham obeyed me and did everything I required of him, keeping my commands, my decrees and my instructions.”  "
"699","Genesis","26","6","So Isaac stayed in Gerar. "
"700","Genesis","26","7","When the men of that place asked him about his wife, he said, “She is my sister,” because he was afraid to say, “She is my wife.” He thought, “The men of this place might kill me on account of Rebekah, because she is beautiful.” "
"701","Genesis","26","8","When Isaac had been there a long time, Abimelek king of the Philistines looked down from a window and saw Isaac caressing his wife Rebekah.  "
"702","Genesis","26","9","So Abimelek summoned Isaac and said, “She is really your wife! Why did you say, ‘She is my sister’?” Isaac answered him, “Because I thought I might lose my life on account of her.” "
"703","Genesis","26","10","Then Abimelek said, “What is this you have done to us? One of the men might well have slept with your wife, and you would have brought guilt upon us.” "
"704","Genesis","26","11","So Abimelek gave orders to all the people: “Anyone who harms this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.” "
"705","Genesis","26","12","Isaac planted crops in that land and the same year reaped a hundredfold, because the  Lord  blessed him.  "
"706","Genesis","26","13","The man became rich, and his wealth continued to grow until he became very wealthy.  "
"707","Genesis","26","14","He had so many flocks and herds and servants that the Philistines envied him.  "
"708","Genesis","26","15","So all the wells that his father’s servants had dug in the time of his father Abraham, the Philistines stopped up, filling them with earth. "
"709","Genesis","26","16","Then Abimelek said to Isaac, “Move away from us; you have become too powerful for us.” "
"710","Genesis","26","17","So Isaac moved away from there and encamped in the Valley of Gerar, where he settled.  "
"711","Genesis","26","18","Isaac reopened the wells that had been dug in the time of his father Abraham, which the Philistines had stopped up after Abraham died, and he gave them the same names his father had given them. "
"712","Genesis","26","19","Isaac’s servants dug in the valley and discovered a well of fresh water there.  "
"713","Genesis","26","20","But the herders of Gerar quarreled with those of Isaac and said, “The water is ours!” So he named the well Esek,  because they disputed with him.  "
"714","Genesis","26","21","Then they dug another well, but they quarreled over that one also; so he named it Sitnah.   "
"715","Genesis","26","22","He moved on from there and dug another well, and no one quarreled over it. He named it Rehoboth,  saying, “Now the  Lord  has given us room and we will flourish in the land.” "
"716","Genesis","26","23","From there he went up to Beersheba.  "
"717","Genesis","26","24","That night the  Lord  appeared to him and said, “I am the God of your father Abraham. Do not be afraid, for I am with you; I will bless you and will increase the number of your descendants for the sake of my servant Abraham.” "
"718","Genesis","26","25","Isaac built an altar there and called on the name of the  Lord . There he pitched his tent, and there his servants dug a well. "
"719","Genesis","26","26","Meanwhile, Abimelek had come to him from Gerar, with Ahuzzath his personal adviser and Phicol the commander of his forces.  "
"720","Genesis","26","27","Isaac asked them, “Why have you come to me, since you were hostile to me and sent me away?” "
"721","Genesis","26","28","They answered, “We saw clearly that the  Lord  was with you; so we said, ‘There ought to be a sworn agreement between us’—between us and you. Let us make a treaty with you  "
"722","Genesis","26","29","that you will do us no harm, just as we did not harm you but always treated you well and sent you away peacefully. And now you are blessed by the  Lord .” "
"723","Genesis","26","30","Isaac then made a feast for them, and they ate and drank.  "
"724","Genesis","26","31","Early the next morning the men swore an oath to each other. Then Isaac sent them on their way, and they went away peacefully. "
"725","Genesis","26","32","That day Isaac’s servants came and told him about the well they had dug. They said, “We’ve found water!”  "
"726","Genesis","26","33","He called it Shibah,  and to this day the name of the town has been Beersheba. "
"727","Genesis","26","34","When Esau was forty years old, he married Judith daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and also Basemath daughter of Elon the Hittite.  "
"728","Genesis","26","35","They were a source of grief to Isaac and Rebekah."
"729","Genesis","27","1","When Isaac was old and his eyes were so weak that he could no longer see, he called for Esau his older son and said to him, “My son.” “Here I am,” he answered. "
"730","Genesis","27","2","Isaac said, “I am now an old man and don’t know the day of my death.  "
"731","Genesis","27","3","Now then, get your equipment—your quiver and bow—and go out to the open country to hunt some wild game for me.  "
"732","Genesis","27","4","Prepare me the kind of tasty food I like and bring it to me to eat, so that I may give you my blessing before I die.” "
"733","Genesis","27","5","Now Rebekah was listening as Isaac spoke to his son Esau. When Esau left for the open country to hunt game and bring it back,  "
"734","Genesis","27","6","Rebekah said to her son Jacob, “Look, I overheard your father say to your brother Esau,  "
"735","Genesis","27","7","‘Bring me some game and prepare me some tasty food to eat, so that I may give you my blessing in the presence of the  Lord  before I die.’  "
"736","Genesis","27","8","Now, my son, listen carefully and do what I tell you:  "
"737","Genesis","27","9","Go out to the flock and bring me two choice young goats, so I can prepare some tasty food for your father, just the way he likes it.  "
"738","Genesis","27","10","Then take it to your father to eat, so that he may give you his blessing before he dies.” "
"739","Genesis","27","11","Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, “But my brother Esau is a hairy man while I have smooth skin.  "
"740","Genesis","27","12","What if my father touches me? I would appear to be tricking him and would bring down a curse on myself rather than a blessing.” "
"741","Genesis","27","13","His mother said to him, “My son, let the curse fall on me. Just do what I say; go and get them for me.” "
"742","Genesis","27","14","So he went and got them and brought them to his mother, and she prepared some tasty food, just the way his father liked it.  "
"743","Genesis","27","15","Then Rebekah took the best clothes of Esau her older son, which she had in the house, and put them on her younger son Jacob.  "
"744","Genesis","27","16","She also covered his hands and the smooth part of his neck with the goatskins.  "
"745","Genesis","27","17","Then she handed to her son Jacob the tasty food and the bread she had made. "
"746","Genesis","27","18","He went to his father and said, “My father.” “Yes, my son,” he answered. “Who is it?” "
"747","Genesis","27","19","Jacob said to his father, “I am Esau your firstborn. I have done as you told me. Please sit up and eat some of my game, so that you may give me your blessing.” "
"748","Genesis","27","20","Isaac asked his son, “How did you find it so quickly, my son?” “The  Lord  your God gave me success,” he replied. "
"749","Genesis","27","21","Then Isaac said to Jacob, “Come near so I can touch you, my son, to know whether you really are my son Esau or not.” "
"750","Genesis","27","22","Jacob went close to his father Isaac, who touched him and said, “The voice is the voice of Jacob, but the hands are the hands of Esau.”  "
"751","Genesis","27","23","He did not recognize him, for his hands were hairy like those of his brother Esau; so he proceeded to bless him.  "
"752","Genesis","27","24","“Are you really my son Esau?” he asked. “I am,” he replied. "
"753","Genesis","27","25","Then he said, “My son, bring me some of your game to eat, so that I may give you my blessing.” Jacob brought it to him and he ate; and he brought some wine and he drank.  "
"754","Genesis","27","26","Then his father Isaac said to him, “Come here, my son, and kiss me.” "
"755","Genesis","27","27","So he went to him and kissed him. When Isaac caught the smell of his clothes, he blessed him and said, “Ah, the smell of my son is like the smell of a field that the  Lord  has blessed. "
"756","Genesis","27","28","May God give you heaven’s dew and earth’s richness— an abundance of grain and new wine. "
"757","Genesis","27","29","May nations serve you and peoples bow down to you. Be lord over your brothers, and may the sons of your mother bow down to you. May those who curse you be cursed and those who bless you be blessed.” "
"758","Genesis","27","30","After Isaac finished blessing him, and Jacob had scarcely left his father’s presence, his brother Esau came in from hunting.  "
"759","Genesis","27","31","He too prepared some tasty food and brought it to his father. Then he said to him, “My father, please sit up and eat some of my game, so that you may give me your blessing.” "
"760","Genesis","27","32","His father Isaac asked him, “Who are you?” “I am your son,” he answered, “your firstborn, Esau.” "
"761","Genesis","27","33","Isaac trembled violently and said, “Who was it, then, that hunted game and brought it to me? I ate it just before you came and I blessed him—and indeed he will be blessed!” "
"762","Genesis","27","34","When Esau heard his father’s words, he burst out with a loud and bitter cry and said to his father, “Bless me—me too, my father!” "
"763","Genesis","27","35","But he said, “Your brother came deceitfully and took your blessing.” "
"764","Genesis","27","36","Esau said, “Isn’t he rightly named Jacob ? This is the second time he has taken advantage of me: He took my birthright, and now he’s taken my blessing!” Then he asked, “Haven’t you reserved any blessing for me?” "
"765","Genesis","27","37","Isaac answered Esau, “I have made him lord over you and have made all his relatives his servants, and I have sustained him with grain and new wine. So what can I possibly do for you, my son?” "
"766","Genesis","27","38","Esau said to his father, “Do you have only one blessing, my father? Bless me too, my father!” Then Esau wept aloud. "
"767","Genesis","27","39","His father Isaac answered him, “Your dwelling will be away from the earth’s richness, away from the dew of heaven above. "
"768","Genesis","27","40","You will live by the sword and you will serve your brother. But when you grow restless, you will throw his yoke from off your neck.” "
"769","Genesis","27","41","Esau held a grudge against Jacob because of the blessing his father had given him. He said to himself, “The days of mourning for my father are near; then I will kill my brother Jacob.” "
"770","Genesis","27","42","When Rebekah was told what her older son Esau had said, she sent for her younger son Jacob and said to him, “Your brother Esau is planning to avenge himself by killing you.  "
"771","Genesis","27","43","Now then, my son, do what I say: Flee at once to my brother Laban in Harran.  "
"772","Genesis","27","44","Stay with him for a while until your brother’s fury subsides.  "
"773","Genesis","27","45","When your brother is no longer angry with you and forgets what you did to him, I’ll send word for you to come back from there. Why should I lose both of you in one day?” "
"774","Genesis","27","46","Then Rebekah said to Isaac, “I’m disgusted with living because of these Hittite women. If Jacob takes a wife from among the women of this land, from Hittite women like these, my life will not be worth living.”"
"775","Genesis","28","1","So Isaac called for Jacob and blessed him. Then he commanded him: “Do not marry a Canaanite woman.  "
"776","Genesis","28","2","Go at once to Paddan Aram,  to the house of your mother’s father Bethuel. Take a wife for yourself there, from among the daughters of Laban, your mother’s brother.  "
"777","Genesis","28","3","May God Almighty  bless you and make you fruitful and increase your numbers until you become a community of peoples.  "
"778","Genesis","28","4","May he give you and your descendants the blessing given to Abraham, so that you may take possession of the land where you now reside as a foreigner, the land God gave to Abraham.”  "
"779","Genesis","28","5","Then Isaac sent Jacob on his way, and he went to Paddan Aram, to Laban son of Bethuel the Aramean, the brother of Rebekah, who was the mother of Jacob and Esau. "
"780","Genesis","28","6","Now Esau learned that Isaac had blessed Jacob and had sent him to Paddan Aram to take a wife from there, and that when he blessed him he commanded him, “Do not marry a Canaanite woman,”  "
"781","Genesis","28","7","and that Jacob had obeyed his father and mother and had gone to Paddan Aram.  "
"782","Genesis","28","8","Esau then realized how displeasing the Canaanite women were to his father Isaac;  "
"783","Genesis","28","9","so he went to Ishmael and married Mahalath, the sister of Nebaioth and daughter of Ishmael son of Abraham, in addition to the wives he already had. "
"784","Genesis","28","10","Jacob left Beersheba and set out for Harran.  "
"785","Genesis","28","11","When he reached a certain place, he stopped for the night because the sun had set. Taking one of the stones there, he put it under his head and lay down to sleep.  "
"786","Genesis","28","12","He had a dream in which he saw a stairway resting on the earth, with its top reaching to heaven, and the angels of God were ascending and descending on it.  "
"787","Genesis","28","13","There above it  stood the  Lord , and he said: “I am the  Lord , the God of your father Abraham and the God of Isaac. I will give you and your descendants the land on which you are lying.  "
"788","Genesis","28","14","Your descendants will be like the dust of the earth, and you will spread out to the west and to the east, to the north and to the south. All peoples on earth will be blessed through you and your offspring.   "
"789","Genesis","28","15","I am with you and will watch over you wherever you go, and I will bring you back to this land. I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised you.” "
"790","Genesis","28","16","When Jacob awoke from his sleep, he thought, “Surely the  Lord  is in this place, and I was not aware of it.”  "
"791","Genesis","28","17","He was afraid and said, “How awesome is this place! This is none other than the house of God; this is the gate of heaven.” "
"792","Genesis","28","18","Early the next morning Jacob took the stone he had placed under his head and set it up as a pillar and poured oil on top of it.  "
"793","Genesis","28","19","He called that place Bethel,  though the city used to be called Luz. "
"794","Genesis","28","20","Then Jacob made a vow, saying, “If God will be with me and will watch over me on this journey I am taking and will give me food to eat and clothes to wear  "
"795","Genesis","28","21","so that I return safely to my father’s household, then the  Lord  will be my God  "
"796","Genesis","28","22","and  this stone that I have set up as a pillar will be God’s house, and of all that you give me I will give you a tenth.”"
"797","Genesis","29","1","Then Jacob continued on his journey and came to the land of the eastern peoples.  "
"798","Genesis","29","2","There he saw a well in the open country, with three flocks of sheep lying near it because the flocks were watered from that well. The stone over the mouth of the well was large.  "
"799","Genesis","29","3","When all the flocks were gathered there, the shepherds would roll the stone away from the well’s mouth and water the sheep. Then they would return the stone to its place over the mouth of the well. "
"800","Genesis","29","4","Jacob asked the shepherds, “My brothers, where are you from?” “We’re from Harran,” they replied. "
"801","Genesis","29","5","He said to them, “Do you know Laban, Nahor’s grandson?” “Yes, we know him,” they answered. "
"802","Genesis","29","6","Then Jacob asked them, “Is he well?” “Yes, he is,” they said, “and here comes his daughter Rachel with the sheep.” "
"803","Genesis","29","7","“Look,” he said, “the sun is still high; it is not time for the flocks to be gathered. Water the sheep and take them back to pasture.” "
"804","Genesis","29","8","“We can’t,” they replied, “until all the flocks are gathered and the stone has been rolled away from the mouth of the well. Then we will water the sheep.” "
"805","Genesis","29","9","While he was still talking with them, Rachel came with her father’s sheep, for she was a shepherd.  "
"806","Genesis","29","10","When Jacob saw Rachel daughter of his uncle Laban, and Laban’s sheep, he went over and rolled the stone away from the mouth of the well and watered his uncle’s sheep.  "
"807","Genesis","29","11","Then Jacob kissed Rachel and began to weep aloud.  "
"808","Genesis","29","12","He had told Rachel that he was a relative of her father and a son of Rebekah. So she ran and told her father. "
"809","Genesis","29","13","As soon as Laban heard the news about Jacob, his sister’s son, he hurried to meet him. He embraced him and kissed him and brought him to his home, and there Jacob told him all these things.  "
"810","Genesis","29","14","Then Laban said to him, “You are my own flesh and blood.” After Jacob had stayed with him for a whole month,  "
"811","Genesis","29","15","Laban said to him, “Just because you are a relative of mine, should you work for me for nothing? Tell me what your wages should be.” "
"812","Genesis","29","16","Now Laban had two daughters; the name of the older was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel.  "
"813","Genesis","29","17","Leah had weak  eyes, but Rachel had a lovely figure and was beautiful.  "
"814","Genesis","29","18","Jacob was in love with Rachel and said, “I’ll work for you seven years in return for your younger daughter Rachel.” "
"815","Genesis","29","19","Laban said, “It’s better that I give her to you than to some other man. Stay here with me.”  "
"816","Genesis","29","20","So Jacob served seven years to get Rachel, but they seemed like only a few days to him because of his love for her. "
"817","Genesis","29","21","Then Jacob said to Laban, “Give me my wife. My time is completed, and I want to make love to her.” "
"818","Genesis","29","22","So Laban brought together all the people of the place and gave a feast.  "
"819","Genesis","29","23","But when evening came, he took his daughter Leah and brought her to Jacob, and Jacob made love to her.  "
"820","Genesis","29","24","And Laban gave his servant Zilpah to his daughter as her attendant. "
"821","Genesis","29","25","When morning came, there was Leah! So Jacob said to Laban, “What is this you have done to me? I served you for Rachel, didn’t I? Why have you deceived me?” "
"822","Genesis","29","26","Laban replied, “It is not our custom here to give the younger daughter in marriage before the older one.  "
"823","Genesis","29","27","Finish this daughter’s bridal week; then we will give you the younger one also, in return for another seven years of work.” "
"824","Genesis","29","28","And Jacob did so. He finished the week with Leah, and then Laban gave him his daughter Rachel to be his wife.  "
"825","Genesis","29","29","Laban gave his servant Bilhah to his daughter Rachel as her attendant.  "
"826","Genesis","29","30","Jacob made love to Rachel also, and his love for Rachel was greater than his love for Leah. And he worked for Laban another seven years. "
"827","Genesis","29","31","When the  Lord  saw that Leah was not loved, he enabled her to conceive, but Rachel remained childless.  "
"828","Genesis","29","32","Leah became pregnant and gave birth to a son. She named him Reuben,  for she said, “It is because the  Lord  has seen my misery. Surely my husband will love me now.” "
"829","Genesis","29","33","She conceived again, and when she gave birth to a son she said, “Because the  Lord  heard that I am not loved, he gave me this one too.” So she named him Simeon. "
"830","Genesis","29","34","Again she conceived, and when she gave birth to a son she said, “Now at last my husband will become attached to me, because I have borne him three sons.” So he was named Levi. "
"831","Genesis","29","35","She conceived again, and when she gave birth to a son she said, “This time I will praise the  Lord .” So she named him Judah.  Then she stopped having children."
"832","Genesis","30","1","When Rachel saw that she was not bearing Jacob any children, she became jealous of her sister. So she said to Jacob, “Give me children, or I’ll die!” "
"833","Genesis","30","2","Jacob became angry with her and said, “Am I in the place of God, who has kept you from having children?” "
"834","Genesis","30","3","Then she said, “Here is Bilhah, my servant. Sleep with her so that she can bear children for me and I too can build a family through her.” "
"835","Genesis","30","4","So she gave him her servant Bilhah as a wife. Jacob slept with her,  "
"836","Genesis","30","5","and she became pregnant and bore him a son.  "
"837","Genesis","30","6","Then Rachel said, “God has vindicated me; he has listened to my plea and given me a son.” Because of this she named him Dan. "
"838","Genesis","30","7","Rachel’s servant Bilhah conceived again and bore Jacob a second son.  "
"839","Genesis","30","8","Then Rachel said, “I have had a great struggle with my sister, and I have won.” So she named him Naphtali. "
"840","Genesis","30","9","When Leah saw that she had stopped having children, she took her servant Zilpah and gave her to Jacob as a wife.  "
"841","Genesis","30","10","Leah’s servant Zilpah bore Jacob a son.  "
"842","Genesis","30","11","Then Leah said, “What good fortune!”  So she named him Gad. "
"843","Genesis","30","12","Leah’s servant Zilpah bore Jacob a second son.  "
"844","Genesis","30","13","Then Leah said, “How happy I am! The women will call me happy.” So she named him Asher. "
"845","Genesis","30","14","During wheat harvest, Reuben went out into the fields and found some mandrake plants, which he brought to his mother Leah. Rachel said to Leah, “Please give me some of your son’s mandrakes.” "
"846","Genesis","30","15","But she said to her, “Wasn’t it enough that you took away my husband? Will you take my son’s mandrakes too?” “Very well,” Rachel said, “he can sleep with you tonight in return for your son’s mandrakes.” "
"847","Genesis","30","16","So when Jacob came in from the fields that evening, Leah went out to meet him. “You must sleep with me,” she said. “I have hired you with my son’s mandrakes.” So he slept with her that night. "
"848","Genesis","30","17","God listened to Leah, and she became pregnant and bore Jacob a fifth son.  "
"849","Genesis","30","18","Then Leah said, “God has rewarded me for giving my servant to my husband.” So she named him Issachar. "
"850","Genesis","30","19","Leah conceived again and bore Jacob a sixth son.  "
"851","Genesis","30","20","Then Leah said, “God has presented me with a precious gift. This time my husband will treat me with honor, because I have borne him six sons.” So she named him Zebulun. "
"852","Genesis","30","21","Some time later she gave birth to a daughter and named her Dinah. "
"853","Genesis","30","22","Then God remembered Rachel; he listened to her and enabled her to conceive.  "
"854","Genesis","30","23","She became pregnant and gave birth to a son and said, “God has taken away my disgrace.”  "
"855","Genesis","30","24","She named him Joseph,  and said, “May the  Lord  add to me another son.” "
"856","Genesis","30","25","After Rachel gave birth to Joseph, Jacob said to Laban, “Send me on my way so I can go back to my own homeland.  "
"857","Genesis","30","26","Give me my wives and children, for whom I have served you, and I will be on my way. You know how much work I’ve done for you.” "
"858","Genesis","30","27","But Laban said to him, “If I have found favor in your eyes, please stay. I have learned by divination that the  Lord  has blessed me because of you.”  "
"859","Genesis","30","28","He added, “Name your wages, and I will pay them.” "
"860","Genesis","30","29","Jacob said to him, “You know how I have worked for you and how your livestock has fared under my care.  "
"861","Genesis","30","30","The little you had before I came has increased greatly, and the  Lord  has blessed you wherever I have been. But now, when may I do something for my own household?” "
"862","Genesis","30","31","“What shall I give you?” he asked. “Don’t give me anything,” Jacob replied. “But if you will do this one thing for me, I will go on tending your flocks and watching over them:  "
"863","Genesis","30","32","Let me go through all your flocks today and remove from them every speckled or spotted sheep, every dark-colored lamb and every spotted or speckled goat. They will be my wages.  "
"864","Genesis","30","33","And my honesty will testify for me in the future, whenever you check on the wages you have paid me. Any goat in my possession that is not speckled or spotted, or any lamb that is not dark-colored, will be considered stolen.” "
"865","Genesis","30","34","“Agreed,” said Laban. “Let it be as you have said.”  "
"866","Genesis","30","35","That same day he removed all the male goats that were streaked or spotted, and all the speckled or spotted female goats (all that had white on them) and all the dark-colored lambs, and he placed them in the care of his sons.  "
"867","Genesis","30","36","Then he put a three-day journey between himself and Jacob, while Jacob continued to tend the rest of Laban’s flocks. "
"868","Genesis","30","37","Jacob, however, took fresh-cut branches from poplar, almond and plane trees and made white stripes on them by peeling the bark and exposing the white inner wood of the branches.  "
"869","Genesis","30","38","Then he placed the peeled branches in all the watering troughs, so that they would be directly in front of the flocks when they came to drink. When the flocks were in heat and came to drink,  "
"870","Genesis","30","39","they mated in front of the branches. And they bore young that were streaked or speckled or spotted.  "
"871","Genesis","30","40","Jacob set apart the young of the flock by themselves, but made the rest face the streaked and dark-colored animals that belonged to Laban. Thus he made separate flocks for himself and did not put them with Laban’s animals.  "
"872","Genesis","30","41","Whenever the stronger females were in heat, Jacob would place the branches in the troughs in front of the animals so they would mate near the branches,  "
"873","Genesis","30","42","but if the animals were weak, he would not place them there. So the weak animals went to Laban and the strong ones to Jacob.  "
"874","Genesis","30","43","In this way the man grew exceedingly prosperous and came to own large flocks, and female and male servants, and camels and donkeys."
"875","Genesis","31","1","Jacob heard that Laban’s sons were saying, “Jacob has taken everything our father owned and has gained all this wealth from what belonged to our father.”  "
"876","Genesis","31","2","And Jacob noticed that Laban’s attitude toward him was not what it had been. "
"877","Genesis","31","3","Then the  Lord  said to Jacob, “Go back to the land of your fathers and to your relatives, and I will be with you.” "
"878","Genesis","31","4","So Jacob sent word to Rachel and Leah to come out to the fields where his flocks were.  "
"879","Genesis","31","5","He said to them, “I see that your father’s attitude toward me is not what it was before, but the God of my father has been with me.  "
"880","Genesis","31","6","You know that I’ve worked for your father with all my strength,  "
"881","Genesis","31","7","yet your father has cheated me by changing my wages ten times. However, God has not allowed him to harm me.  "
"882","Genesis","31","8","If he said, ‘The speckled ones will be your wages,’ then all the flocks gave birth to speckled young; and if he said, ‘The streaked ones will be your wages,’ then all the flocks bore streaked young.  "
"883","Genesis","31","9","So God has taken away your father’s livestock and has given them to me. "
"884","Genesis","31","10","“In breeding season I once had a dream in which I looked up and saw that the male goats mating with the flock were streaked, speckled or spotted.  "
"885","Genesis","31","11","The angel of God said to me in the dream, ‘Jacob.’ I answered, ‘Here I am.’  "
"886","Genesis","31","12","And he said, ‘Look up and see that all the male goats mating with the flock are streaked, speckled or spotted, for I have seen all that Laban has been doing to you.  "
"887","Genesis","31","13","I am the God of Bethel, where you anointed a pillar and where you made a vow to me. Now leave this land at once and go back to your native land.’ ” "
"888","Genesis","31","14","Then Rachel and Leah replied, “Do we still have any share in the inheritance of our father’s estate?  "
"889","Genesis","31","15","Does he not regard us as foreigners? Not only has he sold us, but he has used up what was paid for us.  "
"890","Genesis","31","16","Surely all the wealth that God took away from our father belongs to us and our children. So do whatever God has told you.” "
"891","Genesis","31","17","Then Jacob put his children and his wives on camels,  "
"892","Genesis","31","18","and he drove all his livestock ahead of him, along with all the goods he had accumulated in Paddan Aram,  to go to his father Isaac in the land of Canaan. "
"893","Genesis","31","19","When Laban had gone to shear his sheep, Rachel stole her father’s household gods.  "
"894","Genesis","31","20","Moreover, Jacob deceived Laban the Aramean by not telling him he was running away.  "
"895","Genesis","31","21","So he fled with all he had, crossed the Euphrates River, and headed for the hill country of Gilead. "
"896","Genesis","31","22","On the third day Laban was told that Jacob had fled.  "
"897","Genesis","31","23","Taking his relatives with him, he pursued Jacob for seven days and caught up with him in the hill country of Gilead.  "
"898","Genesis","31","24","Then God came to Laban the Aramean in a dream at night and said to him, “Be careful not to say anything to Jacob, either good or bad.” "
"899","Genesis","31","25","Jacob had pitched his tent in the hill country of Gilead when Laban overtook him, and Laban and his relatives camped there too.  "
"900","Genesis","31","26","Then Laban said to Jacob, “What have you done? You’ve deceived me, and you’ve carried off my daughters like captives in war.  "
"901","Genesis","31","27","Why did you run off secretly and deceive me? Why didn’t you tell me, so I could send you away with joy and singing to the music of timbrels and harps?  "
"902","Genesis","31","28","You didn’t even let me kiss my grandchildren and my daughters goodbye. You have done a foolish thing.  "
"903","Genesis","31","29","I have the power to harm you; but last night the God of your father said to me, ‘Be careful not to say anything to Jacob, either good or bad.’  "
"904","Genesis","31","30","Now you have gone off because you longed to return to your father’s household. But why did you steal my gods?” "
"905","Genesis","31","31","Jacob answered Laban, “I was afraid, because I thought you would take your daughters away from me by force.  "
"906","Genesis","31","32","But if you find anyone who has your gods, that person shall not live. In the presence of our relatives, see for yourself whether there is anything of yours here with me; and if so, take it.” Now Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen the gods. "
"907","Genesis","31","33","So Laban went into Jacob’s tent and into Leah’s tent and into the tent of the two female servants, but he found nothing. After he came out of Leah’s tent, he entered Rachel’s tent.  "
"908","Genesis","31","34","Now Rachel had taken the household gods and put them inside her camel’s saddle and was sitting on them. Laban searched through everything in the tent but found nothing. "
"909","Genesis","31","35","Rachel said to her father, “Don’t be angry, my lord, that I cannot stand up in your presence; I’m having my period.” So he searched but could not find the household gods. "
"910","Genesis","31","36","Jacob was angry and took Laban to task. “What is my crime?” he asked Laban. “How have I wronged you that you hunt me down?  "
"911","Genesis","31","37","Now that you have searched through all my goods, what have you found that belongs to your household? Put it here in front of your relatives and mine, and let them judge between the two of us. "
"912","Genesis","31","38","“I have been with you for twenty years now. Your sheep and goats have not miscarried, nor have I eaten rams from your flocks.  "
"913","Genesis","31","39","I did not bring you animals torn by wild beasts; I bore the loss myself. And you demanded payment from me for whatever was stolen by day or night.  "
"914","Genesis","31","40","This was my situation: The heat consumed me in the daytime and the cold at night, and sleep fled from my eyes.  "
"915","Genesis","31","41","It was like this for the twenty years I was in your household. I worked for you fourteen years for your two daughters and six years for your flocks, and you changed my wages ten times.  "
"916","Genesis","31","42","If the God of my father, the God of Abraham and the Fear of Isaac, had not been with me, you would surely have sent me away empty-handed. But God has seen my hardship and the toil of my hands, and last night he rebuked you.” "
"917","Genesis","31","43","Laban answered Jacob, “The women are my daughters, the children are my children, and the flocks are my flocks. All you see is mine. Yet what can I do today about these daughters of mine, or about the children they have borne?  "
"918","Genesis","31","44","Come now, let’s make a covenant, you and I, and let it serve as a witness between us.” "
"919","Genesis","31","45","So Jacob took a stone and set it up as a pillar.  "
"920","Genesis","31","46","He said to his relatives, “Gather some stones.” So they took stones and piled them in a heap, and they ate there by the heap.  "
"921","Genesis","31","47","Laban called it Jegar Sahadutha, and Jacob called it Galeed. "
"922","Genesis","31","48","Laban said, “This heap is a witness between you and me today.” That is why it was called Galeed.  "
"923","Genesis","31","49","It was also called Mizpah,  because he said, “May the  Lord  keep watch between you and me when we are away from each other.  "
"924","Genesis","31","50","If you mistreat my daughters or if you take any wives besides my daughters, even though no one is with us, remember that God is a witness between you and me.” "
"925","Genesis","31","51","Laban also said to Jacob, “Here is this heap, and here is this pillar I have set up between you and me.  "
"926","Genesis","31","52","This heap is a witness, and this pillar is a witness, that I will not go past this heap to your side to harm you and that you will not go past this heap and pillar to my side to harm me.  "
"927","Genesis","31","53","May the God of Abraham and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge between us.” So Jacob took an oath in the name of the Fear of his father Isaac.  "
"928","Genesis","31","54","He offered a sacrifice there in the hill country and invited his relatives to a meal. After they had eaten, they spent the night there. "
"929","Genesis","31","55","Early the next morning Laban kissed his grandchildren and his daughters and blessed them. Then he left and returned home."
"930","Genesis","32",NA,NA
"931","Genesis","32","1","Jacob also went on his way, and the angels of God met him.  "
"932","Genesis","32","2","When Jacob saw them, he said, “This is the camp of God!” So he named that place Mahanaim. "
"933","Genesis","32","3","Jacob sent messengers ahead of him to his brother Esau in the land of Seir, the country of Edom.  "
"934","Genesis","32","4","He instructed them: “This is what you are to say to my lord Esau: ‘Your servant Jacob says, I have been staying with Laban and have remained there till now.  "
"935","Genesis","32","5","I have cattle and donkeys, sheep and goats, male and female servants. Now I am sending this message to my lord, that I may find favor in your eyes.’ ” "
"936","Genesis","32","6","When the messengers returned to Jacob, they said, “We went to your brother Esau, and now he is coming to meet you, and four hundred men are with him.” "
"937","Genesis","32","7","In great fear and distress Jacob divided the people who were with him into two groups,  and the flocks and herds and camels as well.  "
"938","Genesis","32","8","He thought, “If Esau comes and attacks one group,  the group  that is left may escape.” "
"939","Genesis","32","9","Then Jacob prayed, “O God of my father Abraham, God of my father Isaac,  Lord , you who said to me, ‘Go back to your country and your relatives, and I will make you prosper,’  "
"940","Genesis","32","10","I am unworthy of all the kindness and faithfulness you have shown your servant. I had only my staff when I crossed this Jordan, but now I have become two camps.  "
"941","Genesis","32","11","Save me, I pray, from the hand of my brother Esau, for I am afraid he will come and attack me, and also the mothers with their children.  "
"942","Genesis","32","12","But you have said, ‘I will surely make you prosper and will make your descendants like the sand of the sea, which cannot be counted.’ ” "
"943","Genesis","32","13","He spent the night there, and from what he had with him he selected a gift for his brother Esau:  "
"944","Genesis","32","14","two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,  "
"945","Genesis","32","15","thirty female camels with their young, forty cows and ten bulls, and twenty female donkeys and ten male donkeys.  "
"946","Genesis","32","16","He put them in the care of his servants, each herd by itself, and said to his servants, “Go ahead of me, and keep some space between the herds.” "
"947","Genesis","32","17","He instructed the one in the lead: “When my brother Esau meets you and asks, ‘Who do you belong to, and where are you going, and who owns all these animals in front of you?’  "
"948","Genesis","32","18","then you are to say, ‘They belong to your servant Jacob. They are a gift sent to my lord Esau, and he is coming behind us.’ ” "
"949","Genesis","32","19","He also instructed the second, the third and all the others who followed the herds: “You are to say the same thing to Esau when you meet him.  "
"950","Genesis","32","20","And be sure to say, ‘Your servant Jacob is coming behind us.’ ” For he thought, “I will pacify him with these gifts I am sending on ahead; later, when I see him, perhaps he will receive me.”  "
"951","Genesis","32","21","So Jacob’s gifts went on ahead of him, but he himself spent the night in the camp. "
"952","Genesis","32","22","That night Jacob got up and took his two wives, his two female servants and his eleven sons and crossed the ford of the Jabbok.  "
"953","Genesis","32","23","After he had sent them across the stream, he sent over all his possessions.  "
"954","Genesis","32","24","So Jacob was left alone, and a man wrestled with him till daybreak.  "
"955","Genesis","32","25","When the man saw that he could not overpower him, he touched the socket of Jacob’s hip so that his hip was wrenched as he wrestled with the man.  "
"956","Genesis","32","26","Then the man said, “Let me go, for it is daybreak.” But Jacob replied, “I will not let you go unless you bless me.” "
"957","Genesis","32","27","The man asked him, “What is your name?” “Jacob,” he answered. "
"958","Genesis","32","28","Then the man said, “Your name will no longer be Jacob, but Israel,  because you have struggled with God and with humans and have overcome.” "
"959","Genesis","32","29","Jacob said, “Please tell me your name.” But he replied, “Why do you ask my name?” Then he blessed him there. "
"960","Genesis","32","30","So Jacob called the place Peniel,  saying, “It is because I saw God face to face, and yet my life was spared.” "
"961","Genesis","32","31","The sun rose above him as he passed Peniel,  and he was limping because of his hip.  "
"962","Genesis","32","32","Therefore to this day the Israelites do not eat the tendon attached to the socket of the hip, because the socket of Jacob’s hip was touched near the tendon."
"963","Genesis","33","1","Jacob looked up and there was Esau, coming with his four hundred men; so he divided the children among Leah, Rachel and the two female servants.  "
"964","Genesis","33","2","He put the female servants and their children in front, Leah and her children next, and Rachel and Joseph in the rear.  "
"965","Genesis","33","3","He himself went on ahead and bowed down to the ground seven times as he approached his brother. "
"966","Genesis","33","4","But Esau ran to meet Jacob and embraced him; he threw his arms around his neck and kissed him. And they wept.  "
"967","Genesis","33","5","Then Esau looked up and saw the women and children. “Who are these with you?” he asked. Jacob answered, “They are the children God has graciously given your servant.” "
"968","Genesis","33","6","Then the female servants and their children approached and bowed down.  "
"969","Genesis","33","7","Next, Leah and her children came and bowed down. Last of all came Joseph and Rachel, and they too bowed down. "
"970","Genesis","33","8","Esau asked, “What’s the meaning of all these flocks and herds I met?” “To find favor in your eyes, my lord,” he said. "
"971","Genesis","33","9","But Esau said, “I already have plenty, my brother. Keep what you have for yourself.” "
"972","Genesis","33","10","“No, please!” said Jacob. “If I have found favor in your eyes, accept this gift from me. For to see your face is like seeing the face of God, now that you have received me favorably.  "
"973","Genesis","33","11","Please accept the present that was brought to you, for God has been gracious to me and I have all I need.” And because Jacob insisted, Esau accepted it. "
"974","Genesis","33","12","Then Esau said, “Let us be on our way; I’ll accompany you.” "
"975","Genesis","33","13","But Jacob said to him, “My lord knows that the children are tender and that I must care for the ewes and cows that are nursing their young. If they are driven hard just one day, all the animals will die.  "
"976","Genesis","33","14","So let my lord go on ahead of his servant, while I move along slowly at the pace of the flocks and herds before me and the pace of the children, until I come to my lord in Seir.” "
"977","Genesis","33","15","Esau said, “Then let me leave some of my men with you.” “But why do that?” Jacob asked. “Just let me find favor in the eyes of my lord.” "
"978","Genesis","33","16","So that day Esau started on his way back to Seir.  "
"979","Genesis","33","17","Jacob, however, went to Sukkoth, where he built a place for himself and made shelters for his livestock. That is why the place is called Sukkoth. "
"980","Genesis","33","18","After Jacob came from Paddan Aram,  he arrived safely at the city of Shechem in Canaan and camped within sight of the city.  "
"981","Genesis","33","19","For a hundred pieces of silver,  he bought from the sons of Hamor, the father of Shechem, the plot of ground where he pitched his tent.  "
"982","Genesis","33","20","There he set up an altar and called it El Elohe Israel."
"983","Genesis","34","1","Now Dinah, the daughter Leah had borne to Jacob, went out to visit the women of the land.  "
"984","Genesis","34","2","When Shechem son of Hamor the Hivite, the ruler of that area, saw her, he took her and raped her.  "
"985","Genesis","34","3","His heart was drawn to Dinah daughter of Jacob; he loved the young woman and spoke tenderly to her.  "
"986","Genesis","34","4","And Shechem said to his father Hamor, “Get me this girl as my wife.” "
"987","Genesis","34","5","When Jacob heard that his daughter Dinah had been defiled, his sons were in the fields with his livestock; so he did nothing about it until they came home. "
"988","Genesis","34","6","Then Shechem’s father Hamor went out to talk with Jacob.  "
"989","Genesis","34","7","Meanwhile, Jacob’s sons had come in from the fields as soon as they heard what had happened. They were shocked and furious, because Shechem had done an outrageous thing in  Israel by sleeping with Jacob’s daughter—a thing that should not be done. "
"990","Genesis","34","8","But Hamor said to them, “My son Shechem has his heart set on your daughter. Please give her to him as his wife.  "
"991","Genesis","34","9","Intermarry with us; give us your daughters and take our daughters for yourselves.  "
"992","Genesis","34","10","You can settle among us; the land is open to you. Live in it, trade  in it, and acquire property in it.” "
"993","Genesis","34","11","Then Shechem said to Dinah’s father and brothers, “Let me find favor in your eyes, and I will give you whatever you ask.  "
"994","Genesis","34","12","Make the price for the bride and the gift I am to bring as great as you like, and I’ll pay whatever you ask me. Only give me the young woman as my wife.” "
"995","Genesis","34","13","Because their sister Dinah had been defiled, Jacob’s sons replied deceitfully as they spoke to Shechem and his father Hamor.  "
"996","Genesis","34","14","They said to them, “We can’t do such a thing; we can’t give our sister to a man who is not circumcised. That would be a disgrace to us.  "
"997","Genesis","34","15","We will enter into an agreement with you on one condition only: that you become like us by circumcising all your males.  "
"998","Genesis","34","16","Then we will give you our daughters and take your daughters for ourselves. We’ll settle among you and become one people with you.  "
"999","Genesis","34","17","But if you will not agree to be circumcised, we’ll take our sister and go.” "
"1000","Genesis","34","18","Their proposal seemed good to Hamor and his son Shechem.  "
"1001","Genesis","34","19","The young man, who was the most honored of all his father’s family, lost no time in doing what they said, because he was delighted with Jacob’s daughter.  "
"1002","Genesis","34","20","So Hamor and his son Shechem went to the gate of their city to speak to the men of their city.  "
"1003","Genesis","34","21","“These men are friendly toward us,” they said. “Let them live in our land and trade in it; the land has plenty of room for them. We can marry their daughters and they can marry ours.  "
"1004","Genesis","34","22","But the men will agree to live with us as one people only on the condition that our males be circumcised, as they themselves are.  "
"1005","Genesis","34","23","Won’t their livestock, their property and all their other animals become ours? So let us agree to their terms, and they will settle among us.” "
"1006","Genesis","34","24","All the men who went out of the city gate agreed with Hamor and his son Shechem, and every male in the city was circumcised. "
"1007","Genesis","34","25","Three days later, while all of them were still in pain, two of Jacob’s sons, Simeon and Levi, Dinah’s brothers, took their swords and attacked the unsuspecting city, killing every male.  "
"1008","Genesis","34","26","They put Hamor and his son Shechem to the sword and took Dinah from Shechem’s house and left.  "
"1009","Genesis","34","27","The sons of Jacob came upon the dead bodies and looted the city where  their sister had been defiled.  "
"1010","Genesis","34","28","They seized their flocks and herds and donkeys and everything else of theirs in the city and out in the fields.  "
"1011","Genesis","34","29","They carried off all their wealth and all their women and children, taking as plunder everything in the houses. "
"1012","Genesis","34","30","Then Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, “You have brought trouble on me by making me obnoxious to the Canaanites and Perizzites, the people living in this land. We are few in number, and if they join forces against me and attack me, I and my household will be destroyed.” "
"1013","Genesis","34","31","But they replied, “Should he have treated our sister like a prostitute?”"
"1014","Genesis","35","1","Then God said to Jacob, “Go up to Bethel and settle there, and build an altar there to God, who appeared to you when you were fleeing from your brother Esau.” "
"1015","Genesis","35","2","So Jacob said to his household and to all who were with him, “Get rid of the foreign gods you have with you, and purify yourselves and change your clothes.  "
"1016","Genesis","35","3","Then come, let us go up to Bethel, where I will build an altar to God, who answered me in the day of my distress and who has been with me wherever I have gone.”  "
"1017","Genesis","35","4","So they gave Jacob all the foreign gods they had and the rings in their ears, and Jacob buried them under the oak at Shechem.  "
"1018","Genesis","35","5","Then they set out, and the terror of God fell on the towns all around them so that no one pursued them. "
"1019","Genesis","35","6","Jacob and all the people with him came to Luz (that is, Bethel) in the land of Canaan.  "
"1020","Genesis","35","7","There he built an altar, and he called the place El Bethel,  because it was there that God revealed himself to him when he was fleeing from his brother. "
"1021","Genesis","35","8","Now Deborah, Rebekah’s nurse, died and was buried under the oak outside Bethel. So it was named Allon Bakuth. "
"1022","Genesis","35","9","After Jacob returned from Paddan Aram,  God appeared to him again and blessed him.  "
"1023","Genesis","35","10","God said to him, “Your name is Jacob,  but you will no longer be called Jacob; your name will be Israel. ” So he named him Israel. "
"1024","Genesis","35","11","And God said to him, “I am God Almighty ; be fruitful and increase in number. A nation and a community of nations will come from you, and kings will be among your descendants.  "
"1025","Genesis","35","12","The land I gave to Abraham and Isaac I also give to you, and I will give this land to your descendants after you.”  "
"1026","Genesis","35","13","Then God went up from him at the place where he had talked with him. "
"1027","Genesis","35","14","Jacob set up a stone pillar at the place where God had talked with him, and he poured out a drink offering on it; he also poured oil on it.  "
"1028","Genesis","35","15","Jacob called the place where God had talked with him Bethel. "
"1029","Genesis","35","16","Then they moved on from Bethel. While they were still some distance from Ephrath, Rachel began to give birth and had great difficulty.  "
"1030","Genesis","35","17","And as she was having great difficulty in childbirth, the midwife said to her, “Don’t despair, for you have another son.”  "
"1031","Genesis","35","18","As she breathed her last—for she was dying—she named her son Ben-Oni.  But his father named him Benjamin. "
"1032","Genesis","35","19","So Rachel died and was buried on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem).  "
"1033","Genesis","35","20","Over her tomb Jacob set up a pillar, and to this day that pillar marks Rachel’s tomb. "
"1034","Genesis","35","21","Israel moved on again and pitched his tent beyond Migdal Eder.  "
"1035","Genesis","35","22","While Israel was living in that region, Reuben went in and slept with his father’s concubine Bilhah, and Israel heard of it. Jacob had twelve sons: "
"1036","Genesis","35","23","The sons of Leah: Reuben the firstborn of Jacob, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar and Zebulun. "
"1037","Genesis","35","24","The sons of Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin. "
"1038","Genesis","35","25","The sons of Rachel’s servant Bilhah: Dan and Naphtali. "
"1039","Genesis","35","26","The sons of Leah’s servant Zilpah: Gad and Asher. These were the sons of Jacob, who were born to him in Paddan Aram. "
"1040","Genesis","35","27","Jacob came home to his father Isaac in Mamre, near Kiriath Arba (that is, Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac had stayed.  "
"1041","Genesis","35","28","Isaac lived a hundred and eighty years.  "
"1042","Genesis","35","29","Then he breathed his last and died and was gathered to his people, old and full of years. And his sons Esau and Jacob buried him."
"1043","Genesis","36","1","This is the account of the family line of Esau (that is, Edom). "
"1044","Genesis","36","2","Esau took his wives from the women of Canaan: Adah daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Oholibamah daughter of Anah and granddaughter of Zibeon the Hivite—  "
"1045","Genesis","36","3","also Basemath daughter of Ishmael and sister of Nebaioth. "
"1046","Genesis","36","4","Adah bore Eliphaz to Esau, Basemath bore Reuel,  "
"1047","Genesis","36","5","and Oholibamah bore Jeush, Jalam and Korah. These were the sons of Esau, who were born to him in Canaan. "
"1048","Genesis","36","6","Esau took his wives and sons and daughters and all the members of his household, as well as his livestock and all his other animals and all the goods he had acquired in Canaan, and moved to a land some distance from his brother Jacob.  "
"1049","Genesis","36","7","Their possessions were too great for them to remain together; the land where they were staying could not support them both because of their livestock.  "
"1050","Genesis","36","8","So Esau (that is, Edom) settled in the hill country of Seir. "
"1051","Genesis","36","9","This is the account of the family line of Esau the father of the Edomites in the hill country of Seir. "
"1052","Genesis","36","10","These are the names of Esau’s sons: Eliphaz, the son of Esau’s wife Adah, and Reuel, the son of Esau’s wife Basemath. "
"1053","Genesis","36","11","The sons of Eliphaz: Teman, Omar, Zepho, Gatam and Kenaz. "
"1054","Genesis","36","12","Esau’s son Eliphaz also had a concubine named Timna, who bore him Amalek. These were grandsons of Esau’s wife Adah. "
"1055","Genesis","36","13","The sons of Reuel: Nahath, Zerah, Shammah and Mizzah. These were grandsons of Esau’s wife Basemath. "
"1056","Genesis","36","14","Jeush, Jalam and Korah. "
"1057","Genesis","36","15","These were the chiefs among Esau’s descendants: The sons of Eliphaz the firstborn of Esau: Chiefs Teman, Omar, Zepho, Kenaz,  "
"1058","Genesis","36","16","Korah,  Gatam and Amalek. These were the chiefs descended from Eliphaz in Edom; they were grandsons of Adah. "
"1059","Genesis","36","17","The sons of Esau’s son Reuel: Chiefs Nahath, Zerah, Shammah and Mizzah. These were the chiefs descended from Reuel in Edom; they were grandsons of Esau’s wife Basemath. "
"1060","Genesis","36","18","The sons of Esau’s wife Oholibamah: Chiefs Jeush, Jalam and Korah. These were the chiefs descended from Esau’s wife Oholibamah daughter of Anah. "
"1061","Genesis","36","19","These were the sons of Esau (that is, Edom), and these were their chiefs. "
"1062","Genesis","36","20","These were the sons of Seir the Horite, who were living in the region: Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon, Anah,  "
"1063","Genesis","36","21","Dishon, Ezer and Dishan. These sons of Seir in Edom were Horite chiefs. "
"1064","Genesis","36","22","The sons of Lotan: Hori and Homam.  Timna was Lotan’s sister. "
"1065","Genesis","36","23","The sons of Shobal: Alvan, Manahath, Ebal, Shepho and Onam. "
"1066","Genesis","36","24","The sons of Zibeon: Aiah and Anah. This is the Anah who discovered the hot springs  in the desert while he was grazing the donkeys of his father Zibeon. "
"1067","Genesis","36","25","The children of Anah: Dishon and Oholibamah daughter of Anah. "
"1068","Genesis","36","26","The sons of Dishon : Hemdan, Eshban, Ithran and Keran. "
"1069","Genesis","36","27","The sons of Ezer: Bilhan, Zaavan and Akan. "
"1070","Genesis","36","28","The sons of Dishan: Uz and Aran. "
"1071","Genesis","36","29","These were the Horite chiefs: Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon, Anah,  "
"1072","Genesis","36","30","Dishon, Ezer and Dishan. These were the Horite chiefs, according to their divisions, in the land of Seir. "
"1073","Genesis","36","31","These were the kings who reigned in Edom before any Israelite king reigned: "
"1074","Genesis","36","32","Bela son of Beor became king of Edom. His city was named Dinhabah. "
"1075","Genesis","36","33","When Bela died, Jobab son of Zerah from Bozrah succeeded him as king. "
"1076","Genesis","36","34","When Jobab died, Husham from the land of the Temanites succeeded him as king. "
"1077","Genesis","36","35","When Husham died, Hadad son of Bedad, who defeated Midian in the country of Moab, succeeded him as king. His city was named Avith. "
"1078","Genesis","36","36","When Hadad died, Samlah from Masrekah succeeded him as king. "
"1079","Genesis","36","37","When Samlah died, Shaul from Rehoboth on the river succeeded him as king. "
"1080","Genesis","36","38","When Shaul died, Baal-Hanan son of Akbor succeeded him as king. "
"1081","Genesis","36","39","When Baal-Hanan son of Akbor died, Hadad  succeeded him as king. His city was named Pau, and his wife’s name was Mehetabel daughter of Matred, the daughter of Me-Zahab. "
"1082","Genesis","36","40","These were the chiefs descended from Esau, by name, according to their clans and regions: Timna, Alvah, Jetheth,  "
"1083","Genesis","36","41","Oholibamah, Elah, Pinon,  "
"1084","Genesis","36","42","Kenaz, Teman, Mibzar,  "
"1085","Genesis","36","43","Magdiel and Iram. These were the chiefs of Edom, according to their settlements in the land they occupied. This is the family line of Esau, the father of the Edomites."
"1086","Genesis","37","1","Jacob lived in the land where his father had stayed, the land of Canaan. "
"1087","Genesis","37","2","This is the account of Jacob’s family line. Joseph, a young man of seventeen, was tending the flocks with his brothers, the sons of Bilhah and the sons of Zilpah, his father’s wives, and he brought their father a bad report about them. "
"1088","Genesis","37","3","Now Israel loved Joseph more than any of his other sons, because he had been born to him in his old age; and he made an ornate  robe for him.  "
"1089","Genesis","37","4","When his brothers saw that their father loved him more than any of them, they hated him and could not speak a kind word to him. "
"1090","Genesis","37","5","Joseph had a dream, and when he told it to his brothers, they hated him all the more.  "
"1091","Genesis","37","6","He said to them, “Listen to this dream I had:  "
"1092","Genesis","37","7","We were binding sheaves of grain out in the field when suddenly my sheaf rose and stood upright, while your sheaves gathered around mine and bowed down to it.” "
"1093","Genesis","37","8","His brothers said to him, “Do you intend to reign over us? Will you actually rule us?” And they hated him all the more because of his dream and what he had said. "
"1094","Genesis","37","9","Then he had another dream, and he told it to his brothers. “Listen,” he said, “I had another dream, and this time the sun and moon and eleven stars were bowing down to me.” "
"1095","Genesis","37","10","When he told his father as well as his brothers, his father rebuked him and said, “What is this dream you had? Will your mother and I and your brothers actually come and bow down to the ground before you?”  "
"1096","Genesis","37","11","His brothers were jealous of him, but his father kept the matter in mind. "
"1097","Genesis","37","12","Now his brothers had gone to graze their father’s flocks near Shechem,  "
"1098","Genesis","37","13","and Israel said to Joseph, “As you know, your brothers are grazing the flocks near Shechem. Come, I am going to send you to them.” “Very well,” he replied. "
"1099","Genesis","37","14","So he said to him, “Go and see if all is well with your brothers and with the flocks, and bring word back to me.” Then he sent him off from the Valley of Hebron. When Joseph arrived at Shechem,  "
"1100","Genesis","37","15","a man found him wandering around in the fields and asked him, “What are you looking for?” "
"1101","Genesis","37","16","He replied, “I’m looking for my brothers. Can you tell me where they are grazing their flocks?” "
"1102","Genesis","37","17","“They have moved on from here,” the man answered. “I heard them say, ‘Let’s go to Dothan.’ ” So Joseph went after his brothers and found them near Dothan.  "
"1103","Genesis","37","18","But they saw him in the distance, and before he reached them, they plotted to kill him. "
"1104","Genesis","37","19","“Here comes that dreamer!” they said to each other.  "
"1105","Genesis","37","20","“Come now, let’s kill him and throw him into one of these cisterns and say that a ferocious animal devoured him. Then we’ll see what comes of his dreams.” "
"1106","Genesis","37","21","When Reuben heard this, he tried to rescue him from their hands. “Let’s not take his life,” he said.  "
"1107","Genesis","37","22","“Don’t shed any blood. Throw him into this cistern here in the wilderness, but don’t lay a hand on him.” Reuben said this to rescue him from them and take him back to his father. "
"1108","Genesis","37","23","So when Joseph came to his brothers, they stripped him of his robe—the ornate robe he was wearing—  "
"1109","Genesis","37","24","and they took him and threw him into the cistern. The cistern was empty; there was no water in it. "
"1110","Genesis","37","25","As they sat down to eat their meal, they looked up and saw a caravan of Ishmaelites coming from Gilead. Their camels were loaded with spices, balm and myrrh, and they were on their way to take them down to Egypt. "
"1111","Genesis","37","26","Judah said to his brothers, “What will we gain if we kill our brother and cover up his blood?  "
"1112","Genesis","37","27","Come, let’s sell him to the Ishmaelites and not lay our hands on him; after all, he is our brother, our own flesh and blood.” His brothers agreed. "
"1113","Genesis","37","28","So when the Midianite merchants came by, his brothers pulled Joseph up out of the cistern and sold him for twenty shekels  of silver to the Ishmaelites, who took him to Egypt. "
"1114","Genesis","37","29","When Reuben returned to the cistern and saw that Joseph was not there, he tore his clothes.  "
"1115","Genesis","37","30","He went back to his brothers and said, “The boy isn’t there! Where can I turn now?” "
"1116","Genesis","37","31","Then they got Joseph’s robe, slaughtered a goat and dipped the robe in the blood.  "
"1117","Genesis","37","32","They took the ornate robe back to their father and said, “We found this. Examine it to see whether it is your son’s robe.” "
"1118","Genesis","37","33","He recognized it and said, “It is my son’s robe! Some ferocious animal has devoured him. Joseph has surely been torn to pieces.” "
"1119","Genesis","37","34","Then Jacob tore his clothes, put on sackcloth and mourned for his son many days.  "
"1120","Genesis","37","35","All his sons and daughters came to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted. “No,” he said, “I will continue to mourn until I join my son in the grave.” So his father wept for him. "
"1121","Genesis","37","36","Meanwhile, the Midianites  sold Joseph in Egypt to Potiphar, one of Pharaoh’s officials, the captain of the guard."
"1122","Genesis","38","1","At that time, Judah left his brothers and went down to stay with a man of Adullam named Hirah.  "
"1123","Genesis","38","2","There Judah met the daughter of a Canaanite man named Shua. He married her and made love to her;  "
"1124","Genesis","38","3","she became pregnant and gave birth to a son, who was named Er.  "
"1125","Genesis","38","4","She conceived again and gave birth to a son and named him Onan.  "
"1126","Genesis","38","5","She gave birth to still another son and named him Shelah. It was at Kezib that she gave birth to him. "
"1127","Genesis","38","6","Judah got a wife for Er, his firstborn, and her name was Tamar.  "
"1128","Genesis","38","7","But Er, Judah’s firstborn, was wicked in the  Lord ’s sight; so the  Lord  put him to death. "
"1129","Genesis","38","8","Then Judah said to Onan, “Sleep with your brother’s wife and fulfill your duty to her as a brother-in-law to raise up offspring for your brother.”  "
"1130","Genesis","38","9","But Onan knew that the child would not be his; so whenever he slept with his brother’s wife, he spilled his semen on the ground to keep from providing offspring for his brother.  "
"1131","Genesis","38","10","What he did was wicked in the  Lord ’s sight; so the  Lord  put him to death also. "
"1132","Genesis","38","11","Judah then said to his daughter-in-law Tamar, “Live as a widow in your father’s household until my son Shelah grows up.” For he thought, “He may die too, just like his brothers.” So Tamar went to live in her father’s household. "
"1133","Genesis","38","12","After a long time Judah’s wife, the daughter of Shua, died. When Judah had recovered from his grief, he went up to Timnah, to the men who were shearing his sheep, and his friend Hirah the Adullamite went with him. "
"1134","Genesis","38","13","When Tamar was told, “Your father-in-law is on his way to Timnah to shear his sheep,”  "
"1135","Genesis","38","14","she took off her widow’s clothes, covered herself with a veil to disguise herself, and then sat down at the entrance to Enaim, which is on the road to Timnah. For she saw that, though Shelah had now grown up, she had not been given to him as his wife. "
"1136","Genesis","38","15","When Judah saw her, he thought she was a prostitute, for she had covered her face.  "
"1137","Genesis","38","16","Not realizing that she was his daughter-in-law, he went over to her by the roadside and said, “Come now, let me sleep with you.” “And what will you give me to sleep with you?” she asked. "
"1138","Genesis","38","17","“I’ll send you a young goat from my flock,” he said. “Will you give me something as a pledge until you send it?” she asked. "
"1139","Genesis","38","18","He said, “What pledge should I give you?” “Your seal and its cord, and the staff in your hand,” she answered. So he gave them to her and slept with her, and she became pregnant by him.  "
"1140","Genesis","38","19","After she left, she took off her veil and put on her widow’s clothes again. "
"1141","Genesis","38","20","Meanwhile Judah sent the young goat by his friend the Adullamite in order to get his pledge back from the woman, but he did not find her.  "
"1142","Genesis","38","21","He asked the men who lived there, “Where is the shrine prostitute who was beside the road at Enaim?” “There hasn’t been any shrine prostitute here,” they said. "
"1143","Genesis","38","22","So he went back to Judah and said, “I didn’t find her. Besides, the men who lived there said, ‘There hasn’t been any shrine prostitute here.’ ” "
"1144","Genesis","38","23","Then Judah said, “Let her keep what she has, or we will become a laughingstock. After all, I did send her this young goat, but you didn’t find her.” "
"1145","Genesis","38","24","About three months later Judah was told, “Your daughter-in-law Tamar is guilty of prostitution, and as a result she is now pregnant.” Judah said, “Bring her out and have her burned to death!” "
"1146","Genesis","38","25","As she was being brought out, she sent a message to her father-in-law. “I am pregnant by the man who owns these,” she said. And she added, “See if you recognize whose seal and cord and staff these are.” "
"1147","Genesis","38","26","Judah recognized them and said, “She is more righteous than I, since I wouldn’t give her to my son Shelah.” And he did not sleep with her again. "
"1148","Genesis","38","27","When the time came for her to give birth, there were twin boys in her womb.  "
"1149","Genesis","38","28","As she was giving birth, one of them put out his hand; so the midwife took a scarlet thread and tied it on his wrist and said, “This one came out first.”  "
"1150","Genesis","38","29","But when he drew back his hand, his brother came out, and she said, “So this is how you have broken out!” And he was named Perez.   "
"1151","Genesis","38","30","Then his brother, who had the scarlet thread on his wrist, came out. And he was named Zerah."
"1152","Genesis","39","1","Now Joseph had been taken down to Egypt. Potiphar, an Egyptian who was one of Pharaoh’s officials, the captain of the guard, bought him from the Ishmaelites who had taken him there. "
"1153","Genesis","39","2","The  Lord  was with Joseph so that he prospered, and he lived in the house of his Egyptian master.  "
"1154","Genesis","39","3","When his master saw that the  Lord  was with him and that the  Lord  gave him success in everything he did,  "
"1155","Genesis","39","4","Joseph found favor in his eyes and became his attendant. Potiphar put him in charge of his household, and he entrusted to his care everything he owned.  "
"1156","Genesis","39","5","From the time he put him in charge of his household and of all that he owned, the  Lord  blessed the household of the Egyptian because of Joseph. The blessing of the  Lord  was on everything Potiphar had, both in the house and in the field.  "
"1157","Genesis","39","6","So Potiphar left everything he had in Joseph’s care; with Joseph in charge, he did not concern himself with anything except the food he ate. Now Joseph was well-built and handsome,  "
"1158","Genesis","39","7","and after a while his master’s wife took notice of Joseph and said, “Come to bed with me!” "
"1159","Genesis","39","8","But he refused. “With me in charge,” he told her, “my master does not concern himself with anything in the house; everything he owns he has entrusted to my care.  "
"1160","Genesis","39","9","No one is greater in this house than I am. My master has withheld nothing from me except you, because you are his wife. How then could I do such a wicked thing and sin against God?”  "
"1161","Genesis","39","10","And though she spoke to Joseph day after day, he refused to go to bed with her or even be with her. "
"1162","Genesis","39","11","One day he went into the house to attend to his duties, and none of the household servants was inside.  "
"1163","Genesis","39","12","She caught him by his cloak and said, “Come to bed with me!” But he left his cloak in her hand and ran out of the house. "
"1164","Genesis","39","13","When she saw that he had left his cloak in her hand and had run out of the house,  "
"1165","Genesis","39","14","she called her household servants. “Look,” she said to them, “this Hebrew has been brought to us to make sport of us! He came in here to sleep with me, but I screamed.  "
"1166","Genesis","39","15","When he heard me scream for help, he left his cloak beside me and ran out of the house.” "
"1167","Genesis","39","16","She kept his cloak beside her until his master came home.  "
"1168","Genesis","39","17","Then she told him this story: “That Hebrew slave you brought us came to me to make sport of me.  "
"1169","Genesis","39","18","But as soon as I screamed for help, he left his cloak beside me and ran out of the house.” "
"1170","Genesis","39","19","When his master heard the story his wife told him, saying, “This is how your slave treated me,” he burned with anger.  "
"1171","Genesis","39","20","Joseph’s master took him and put him in prison, the place where the king’s prisoners were confined. But while Joseph was there in the prison,  "
"1172","Genesis","39","21","the  Lord  was with him; he showed him kindness and granted him favor in the eyes of the prison warden.  "
"1173","Genesis","39","22","So the warden put Joseph in charge of all those held in the prison, and he was made responsible for all that was done there.  "
"1174","Genesis","39","23","The warden paid no attention to anything under Joseph’s care, because the  Lord  was with Joseph and gave him success in whatever he did."
"1175","Genesis","40","1","Some time later, the cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt offended their master, the king of Egypt.  "
"1176","Genesis","40","2","Pharaoh was angry with his two officials, the chief cupbearer and the chief baker,  "
"1177","Genesis","40","3","and put them in custody in the house of the captain of the guard, in the same prison where Joseph was confined.  "
"1178","Genesis","40","4","The captain of the guard assigned them to Joseph, and he attended them. After they had been in custody for some time,  "
"1179","Genesis","40","5","each of the two men—the cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were being held in prison—had a dream the same night, and each dream had a meaning of its own. "
"1180","Genesis","40","6","When Joseph came to them the next morning, he saw that they were dejected.  "
"1181","Genesis","40","7","So he asked Pharaoh’s officials who were in custody with him in his master’s house, “Why do you look so sad today?” "
"1182","Genesis","40","8","“We both had dreams,” they answered, “but there is no one to interpret them.” Then Joseph said to them, “Do not interpretations belong to God? Tell me your dreams.” "
"1183","Genesis","40","9","So the chief cupbearer told Joseph his dream. He said to him, “In my dream I saw a vine in front of me,  "
"1184","Genesis","40","10","and on the vine were three branches. As soon as it budded, it blossomed, and its clusters ripened into grapes.  "
"1185","Genesis","40","11","Pharaoh’s cup was in my hand, and I took the grapes, squeezed them into Pharaoh’s cup and put the cup in his hand.” "
"1186","Genesis","40","12","“This is what it means,” Joseph said to him. “The three branches are three days.  "
"1187","Genesis","40","13","Within three days Pharaoh will lift up your head and restore you to your position, and you will put Pharaoh’s cup in his hand, just as you used to do when you were his cupbearer.  "
"1188","Genesis","40","14","But when all goes well with you, remember me and show me kindness; mention me to Pharaoh and get me out of this prison.  "
"1189","Genesis","40","15","I was forcibly carried off from the land of the Hebrews, and even here I have done nothing to deserve being put in a dungeon.” "
"1190","Genesis","40","16","When the chief baker saw that Joseph had given a favorable interpretation, he said to Joseph, “I too had a dream: On my head were three baskets of bread.   "
"1191","Genesis","40","17","In the top basket were all kinds of baked goods for Pharaoh, but the birds were eating them out of the basket on my head.” "
"1192","Genesis","40","18","“This is what it means,” Joseph said. “The three baskets are three days.  "
"1193","Genesis","40","19","Within three days Pharaoh will lift off your head and impale your body on a pole. And the birds will eat away your flesh.” "
"1194","Genesis","40","20","Now the third day was Pharaoh’s birthday, and he gave a feast for all his officials. He lifted up the heads of the chief cupbearer and the chief baker in the presence of his officials:  "
"1195","Genesis","40","21","He restored the chief cupbearer to his position, so that he once again put the cup into Pharaoh’s hand—  "
"1196","Genesis","40","22","but he impaled the chief baker, just as Joseph had said to them in his interpretation. "
"1197","Genesis","40","23","The chief cupbearer, however, did not remember Joseph; he forgot him."
"1198","Genesis","41","1","When two full years had passed, Pharaoh had a dream: He was standing by the Nile,  "
"1199","Genesis","41","2","when out of the river there came up seven cows, sleek and fat, and they grazed among the reeds.  "
"1200","Genesis","41","3","After them, seven other cows, ugly and gaunt, came up out of the Nile and stood beside those on the riverbank.  "
"1201","Genesis","41","4","And the cows that were ugly and gaunt ate up the seven sleek, fat cows. Then Pharaoh woke up. "
"1202","Genesis","41","5","He fell asleep again and had a second dream: Seven heads of grain, healthy and good, were growing on a single stalk.  "
"1203","Genesis","41","6","After them, seven other heads of grain sprouted—thin and scorched by the east wind.  "
"1204","Genesis","41","7","The thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven healthy, full heads. Then Pharaoh woke up; it had been a dream. "
"1205","Genesis","41","8","In the morning his mind was troubled, so he sent for all the magicians and wise men of Egypt. Pharaoh told them his dreams, but no one could interpret them for him. "
"1206","Genesis","41","9","Then the chief cupbearer said to Pharaoh, “Today I am reminded of my shortcomings.  "
"1207","Genesis","41","10","Pharaoh was once angry with his servants, and he imprisoned me and the chief baker in the house of the captain of the guard.  "
"1208","Genesis","41","11","Each of us had a dream the same night, and each dream had a meaning of its own.  "
"1209","Genesis","41","12","Now a young Hebrew was there with us, a servant of the captain of the guard. We told him our dreams, and he interpreted them for us, giving each man the interpretation of his dream.  "
"1210","Genesis","41","13","And things turned out exactly as he interpreted them to us: I was restored to my position, and the other man was impaled.” "
"1211","Genesis","41","14","So Pharaoh sent for Joseph, and he was quickly brought from the dungeon. When he had shaved and changed his clothes, he came before Pharaoh. "
"1212","Genesis","41","15","Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I had a dream, and no one can interpret it. But I have heard it said of you that when you hear a dream you can interpret it.” "
"1213","Genesis","41","16","“I cannot do it,” Joseph replied to Pharaoh, “but God will give Pharaoh the answer he desires.” "
"1214","Genesis","41","17","Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “In my dream I was standing on the bank of the Nile,  "
"1215","Genesis","41","18","when out of the river there came up seven cows, fat and sleek, and they grazed among the reeds.  "
"1216","Genesis","41","19","After them, seven other cows came up—scrawny and very ugly and lean. I had never seen such ugly cows in all the land of Egypt.  "
"1217","Genesis","41","20","The lean, ugly cows ate up the seven fat cows that came up first.  "
"1218","Genesis","41","21","But even after they ate them, no one could tell that they had done so; they looked just as ugly as before. Then I woke up. "
"1219","Genesis","41","22","“In my dream I saw seven heads of grain, full and good, growing on a single stalk.  "
"1220","Genesis","41","23","After them, seven other heads sprouted—withered and thin and scorched by the east wind.  "
"1221","Genesis","41","24","The thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven good heads. I told this to the magicians, but none of them could explain it to me.” "
"1222","Genesis","41","25","Then Joseph said to Pharaoh, “The dreams of Pharaoh are one and the same. God has revealed to Pharaoh what he is about to do.  "
"1223","Genesis","41","26","The seven good cows are seven years, and the seven good heads of grain are seven years; it is one and the same dream.  "
"1224","Genesis","41","27","The seven lean, ugly cows that came up afterward are seven years, and so are the seven worthless heads of grain scorched by the east wind: They are seven years of famine. "
"1225","Genesis","41","28","“It is just as I said to Pharaoh: God has shown Pharaoh what he is about to do.  "
"1226","Genesis","41","29","Seven years of great abundance are coming throughout the land of Egypt,  "
"1227","Genesis","41","30","but seven years of famine will follow them. Then all the abundance in Egypt will be forgotten, and the famine will ravage the land.  "
"1228","Genesis","41","31","The abundance in the land will not be remembered, because the famine that follows it will be so severe.  "
"1229","Genesis","41","32","The reason the dream was given to Pharaoh in two forms is that the matter has been firmly decided by God, and God will do it soon. "
"1230","Genesis","41","33","“And now let Pharaoh look for a discerning and wise man and put him in charge of the land of Egypt.  "
"1231","Genesis","41","34","Let Pharaoh appoint commissioners over the land to take a fifth of the harvest of Egypt during the seven years of abundance.  "
"1232","Genesis","41","35","They should collect all the food of these good years that are coming and store up the grain under the authority of Pharaoh, to be kept in the cities for food.  "
"1233","Genesis","41","36","This food should be held in reserve for the country, to be used during the seven years of famine that will come upon Egypt, so that the country may not be ruined by the famine.” "
"1234","Genesis","41","37","The plan seemed good to Pharaoh and to all his officials.  "
"1235","Genesis","41","38","So Pharaoh asked them, “Can we find anyone like this man, one in whom is the spirit of God ?” "
"1236","Genesis","41","39","Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Since God has made all this known to you, there is no one so discerning and wise as you.  "
"1237","Genesis","41","40","You shall be in charge of my palace, and all my people are to submit to your orders. Only with respect to the throne will I be greater than you.” "
"1238","Genesis","41","41","So Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I hereby put you in charge of the whole land of Egypt.”  "
"1239","Genesis","41","42","Then Pharaoh took his signet ring from his finger and put it on Joseph’s finger. He dressed him in robes of fine linen and put a gold chain around his neck.  "
"1240","Genesis","41","43","He had him ride in a chariot as his second-in-command,  and people shouted before him, “Make way !” Thus he put him in charge of the whole land of Egypt. "
"1241","Genesis","41","44","Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I am Pharaoh, but without your word no one will lift hand or foot in all Egypt.”  "
"1242","Genesis","41","45","Pharaoh gave Joseph the name Zaphenath-Paneah and gave him Asenath daughter of Potiphera, priest of On,  to be his wife. And Joseph went throughout the land of Egypt. "
"1243","Genesis","41","46","Joseph was thirty years old when he entered the service of Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from Pharaoh’s presence and traveled throughout Egypt.  "
"1244","Genesis","41","47","During the seven years of abundance the land produced plentifully.  "
"1245","Genesis","41","48","Joseph collected all the food produced in those seven years of abundance in Egypt and stored it in the cities. In each city he put the food grown in the fields surrounding it.  "
"1246","Genesis","41","49","Joseph stored up huge quantities of grain, like the sand of the sea; it was so much that he stopped keeping records because it was beyond measure. "
"1247","Genesis","41","50","Before the years of famine came, two sons were born to Joseph by Asenath daughter of Potiphera, priest of On.  "
"1248","Genesis","41","51","Joseph named his firstborn Manasseh  and said, “It is because God has made me forget all my trouble and all my father’s household.”  "
"1249","Genesis","41","52","The second son he named Ephraim  and said, “It is because God has made me fruitful in the land of my suffering.” "
"1250","Genesis","41","53","The seven years of abundance in Egypt came to an end,  "
"1251","Genesis","41","54","and the seven years of famine began, just as Joseph had said. There was famine in all the other lands, but in the whole land of Egypt there was food.  "
"1252","Genesis","41","55","When all Egypt began to feel the famine, the people cried to Pharaoh for food. Then Pharaoh told all the Egyptians, “Go to Joseph and do what he tells you.” "
"1253","Genesis","41","56","When the famine had spread over the whole country, Joseph opened all the storehouses and sold grain to the Egyptians, for the famine was severe throughout Egypt.  "
"1254","Genesis","41","57","And all the world came to Egypt to buy grain from Joseph, because the famine was severe everywhere."
"1255","Genesis","42","1","When Jacob learned that there was grain in Egypt, he said to his sons, “Why do you just keep looking at each other?”  "
"1256","Genesis","42","2","He continued, “I have heard that there is grain in Egypt. Go down there and buy some for us, so that we may live and not die.” "
"1257","Genesis","42","3","Then ten of Joseph’s brothers went down to buy grain from Egypt.  "
"1258","Genesis","42","4","But Jacob did not send Benjamin, Joseph’s brother, with the others, because he was afraid that harm might come to him.  "
"1259","Genesis","42","5","So Israel’s sons were among those who went to buy grain, for there was famine in the land of Canaan also. "
"1260","Genesis","42","6","Now Joseph was the governor of the land, the person who sold grain to all its people. So when Joseph’s brothers arrived, they bowed down to him with their faces to the ground.  "
"1261","Genesis","42","7","As soon as Joseph saw his brothers, he recognized them, but he pretended to be a stranger and spoke harshly to them. “Where do you come from?” he asked. “From the land of Canaan,” they replied, “to buy food.” "
"1262","Genesis","42","8","Although Joseph recognized his brothers, they did not recognize him.  "
"1263","Genesis","42","9","Then he remembered his dreams about them and said to them, “You are spies! You have come to see where our land is unprotected.” "
"1264","Genesis","42","10","“No, my lord,” they answered. “Your servants have come to buy food.  "
"1265","Genesis","42","11","We are all the sons of one man. Your servants are honest men, not spies.” "
"1266","Genesis","42","12","“No!” he said to them. “You have come to see where our land is unprotected.” "
"1267","Genesis","42","13","But they replied, “Your servants were twelve brothers, the sons of one man, who lives in the land of Canaan. The youngest is now with our father, and one is no more.” "
"1268","Genesis","42","14","Joseph said to them, “It is just as I told you: You are spies!  "
"1269","Genesis","42","15","And this is how you will be tested: As surely as Pharaoh lives, you will not leave this place unless your youngest brother comes here.  "
"1270","Genesis","42","16","Send one of your number to get your brother; the rest of you will be kept in prison, so that your words may be tested to see if you are telling the truth. If you are not, then as surely as Pharaoh lives, you are spies!”  "
"1271","Genesis","42","17","And he put them all in custody for three days. "
"1272","Genesis","42","18","On the third day, Joseph said to them, “Do this and you will live, for I fear God:  "
"1273","Genesis","42","19","If you are honest men, let one of your brothers stay here in prison, while the rest of you go and take grain back for your starving households.  "
"1274","Genesis","42","20","But you must bring your youngest brother to me, so that your words may be verified and that you may not die.” This they proceeded to do. "
"1275","Genesis","42","21","They said to one another, “Surely we are being punished because of our brother. We saw how distressed he was when he pleaded with us for his life, but we would not listen; that’s why this distress has come on us.” "
"1276","Genesis","42","22","Reuben replied, “Didn’t I tell you not to sin against the boy? But you wouldn’t listen! Now we must give an accounting for his blood.”  "
"1277","Genesis","42","23","They did not realize that Joseph could understand them, since he was using an interpreter. "
"1278","Genesis","42","24","He turned away from them and began to weep, but then came back and spoke to them again. He had Simeon taken from them and bound before their eyes. "
"1279","Genesis","42","25","Joseph gave orders to fill their bags with grain, to put each man’s silver back in his sack, and to give them provisions for their journey. After this was done for them,  "
"1280","Genesis","42","26","they loaded their grain on their donkeys and left. "
"1281","Genesis","42","27","At the place where they stopped for the night one of them opened his sack to get feed for his donkey, and he saw his silver in the mouth of his sack.  "
"1282","Genesis","42","28","“My silver has been returned,” he said to his brothers. “Here it is in my sack.” Their hearts sank and they turned to each other trembling and said, “What is this that God has done to us?” "
"1283","Genesis","42","29","When they came to their father Jacob in the land of Canaan, they told him all that had happened to them. They said,  "
"1284","Genesis","42","30","“The man who is lord over the land spoke harshly to us and treated us as though we were spying on the land.  "
"1285","Genesis","42","31","But we said to him, ‘We are honest men; we are not spies.  "
"1286","Genesis","42","32","We were twelve brothers, sons of one father. One is no more, and the youngest is now with our father in Canaan.’ "
"1287","Genesis","42","33","“Then the man who is lord over the land said to us, ‘This is how I will know whether you are honest men: Leave one of your brothers here with me, and take food for your starving households and go.  "
"1288","Genesis","42","34","But bring your youngest brother to me so I will know that you are not spies but honest men. Then I will give your brother back to you, and you can trade  in the land.’ ” "
"1289","Genesis","42","35","As they were emptying their sacks, there in each man’s sack was his pouch of silver! When they and their father saw the money pouches, they were frightened.  "
"1290","Genesis","42","36","Their father Jacob said to them, “You have deprived me of my children. Joseph is no more and Simeon is no more, and now you want to take Benjamin. Everything is against me!” "
"1291","Genesis","42","37","Then Reuben said to his father, “You may put both of my sons to death if I do not bring him back to you. Entrust him to my care, and I will bring him back.” "
"1292","Genesis","42","38","But Jacob said, “My son will not go down there with you; his brother is dead and he is the only one left. If harm comes to him on the journey you are taking, you will bring my gray head down to the grave in sorrow.”"
"1293","Genesis","43","1","Now the famine was still severe in the land.  "
"1294","Genesis","43","2","So when they had eaten all the grain they had brought from Egypt, their father said to them, “Go back and buy us a little more food.” "
"1295","Genesis","43","3","But Judah said to him, “The man warned us solemnly, ‘You will not see my face again unless your brother is with you.’  "
"1296","Genesis","43","4","If you will send our brother along with us, we will go down and buy food for you.  "
"1297","Genesis","43","5","But if you will not send him, we will not go down, because the man said to us, ‘You will not see my face again unless your brother is with you.’ ” "
"1298","Genesis","43","6","Israel asked, “Why did you bring this trouble on me by telling the man you had another brother?” "
"1299","Genesis","43","7","They replied, “The man questioned us closely about ourselves and our family. ‘Is your father still living?’ he asked us. ‘Do you have another brother?’ We simply answered his questions. How were we to know he would say, ‘Bring your brother down here’?” "
"1300","Genesis","43","8","Then Judah said to Israel his father, “Send the boy along with me and we will go at once, so that we and you and our children may live and not die.  "
"1301","Genesis","43","9","I myself will guarantee his safety; you can hold me personally responsible for him. If I do not bring him back to you and set him here before you, I will bear the blame before you all my life.  "
"1302","Genesis","43","10","As it is, if we had not delayed, we could have gone and returned twice.” "
"1303","Genesis","43","11","Then their father Israel said to them, “If it must be, then do this: Put some of the best products of the land in your bags and take them down to the man as a gift—a little balm and a little honey, some spices and myrrh, some pistachio nuts and almonds.  "
"1304","Genesis","43","12","Take double the amount of silver with you, for you must return the silver that was put back into the mouths of your sacks. Perhaps it was a mistake.  "
"1305","Genesis","43","13","Take your brother also and go back to the man at once.  "
"1306","Genesis","43","14","And may God Almighty  grant you mercy before the man so that he will let your other brother and Benjamin come back with you. As for me, if I am bereaved, I am bereaved.” "
"1307","Genesis","43","15","So the men took the gifts and double the amount of silver, and Benjamin also. They hurried down to Egypt and presented themselves to Joseph.  "
"1308","Genesis","43","16","When Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the steward of his house, “Take these men to my house, slaughter an animal and prepare a meal; they are to eat with me at noon.” "
"1309","Genesis","43","17","The man did as Joseph told him and took the men to Joseph’s house.  "
"1310","Genesis","43","18","Now the men were frightened when they were taken to his house. They thought, “We were brought here because of the silver that was put back into our sacks the first time. He wants to attack us and overpower us and seize us as slaves and take our donkeys.” "
"1311","Genesis","43","19","So they went up to Joseph’s steward and spoke to him at the entrance to the house.  "
"1312","Genesis","43","20","“We beg your pardon, our lord,” they said, “we came down here the first time to buy food.  "
"1313","Genesis","43","21","But at the place where we stopped for the night we opened our sacks and each of us found his silver—the exact weight—in the mouth of his sack. So we have brought it back with us.  "
"1314","Genesis","43","22","We have also brought additional silver with us to buy food. We don’t know who put our silver in our sacks.” "
"1315","Genesis","43","23","“It’s all right,” he said. “Don’t be afraid. Your God, the God of your father, has given you treasure in your sacks; I received your silver.” Then he brought Simeon out to them. "
"1316","Genesis","43","24","The steward took the men into Joseph’s house, gave them water to wash their feet and provided fodder for their donkeys.  "
"1317","Genesis","43","25","They prepared their gifts for Joseph’s arrival at noon, because they had heard that they were to eat there. "
"1318","Genesis","43","26","When Joseph came home, they presented to him the gifts they had brought into the house, and they bowed down before him to the ground.  "
"1319","Genesis","43","27","He asked them how they were, and then he said, “How is your aged father you told me about? Is he still living?” "
"1320","Genesis","43","28","They replied, “Your servant our father is still alive and well.” And they bowed down, prostrating themselves before him. "
"1321","Genesis","43","29","As he looked about and saw his brother Benjamin, his own mother’s son, he asked, “Is this your youngest brother, the one you told me about?” And he said, “God be gracious to you, my son.”  "
"1322","Genesis","43","30","Deeply moved at the sight of his brother, Joseph hurried out and looked for a place to weep. He went into his private room and wept there. "
"1323","Genesis","43","31","After he had washed his face, he came out and, controlling himself, said, “Serve the food.” "
"1324","Genesis","43","32","They served him by himself, the brothers by themselves, and the Egyptians who ate with him by themselves, because Egyptians could not eat with Hebrews, for that is detestable to Egyptians.  "
"1325","Genesis","43","33","The men had been seated before him in the order of their ages, from the firstborn to the youngest; and they looked at each other in astonishment.  "
"1326","Genesis","43","34","When portions were served to them from Joseph’s table, Benjamin’s portion was five times as much as anyone else’s. So they feasted and drank freely with him."
"1327","Genesis","44","1","Now Joseph gave these instructions to the steward of his house: “Fill the men’s sacks with as much food as they can carry, and put each man’s silver in the mouth of his sack.  "
"1328","Genesis","44","2","Then put my cup, the silver one, in the mouth of the youngest one’s sack, along with the silver for his grain.” And he did as Joseph said. "
"1329","Genesis","44","3","As morning dawned, the men were sent on their way with their donkeys.  "
"1330","Genesis","44","4","They had not gone far from the city when Joseph said to his steward, “Go after those men at once, and when you catch up with them, say to them, ‘Why have you repaid good with evil?  "
"1331","Genesis","44","5","Isn’t this the cup my master drinks from and also uses for divination? This is a wicked thing you have done.’ ” "
"1332","Genesis","44","6","When he caught up with them, he repeated these words to them.  "
"1333","Genesis","44","7","But they said to him, “Why does my lord say such things? Far be it from your servants to do anything like that!  "
"1334","Genesis","44","8","We even brought back to you from the land of Canaan the silver we found inside the mouths of our sacks. So why would we steal silver or gold from your master’s house?  "
"1335","Genesis","44","9","If any of your servants is found to have it, he will die; and the rest of us will become my lord’s slaves.” "
"1336","Genesis","44","10","“Very well, then,” he said, “let it be as you say. Whoever is found to have it will become my slave; the rest of you will be free from blame.” "
"1337","Genesis","44","11","Each of them quickly lowered his sack to the ground and opened it.  "
"1338","Genesis","44","12","Then the steward proceeded to search, beginning with the oldest and ending with the youngest. And the cup was found in Benjamin’s sack.  "
"1339","Genesis","44","13","At this, they tore their clothes. Then they all loaded their donkeys and returned to the city. "
"1340","Genesis","44","14","Joseph was still in the house when Judah and his brothers came in, and they threw themselves to the ground before him.  "
"1341","Genesis","44","15","Joseph said to them, “What is this you have done? Don’t you know that a man like me can find things out by divination?” "
"1342","Genesis","44","16","“What can we say to my lord?” Judah replied. “What can we say? How can we prove our innocence? God has uncovered your servants’ guilt. We are now my lord’s slaves—we ourselves and the one who was found to have the cup.” "
"1343","Genesis","44","17","But Joseph said, “Far be it from me to do such a thing! Only the man who was found to have the cup will become my slave. The rest of you, go back to your father in peace.” "
"1344","Genesis","44","18","Then Judah went up to him and said: “Pardon your servant, my lord, let me speak a word to my lord. Do not be angry with your servant, though you are equal to Pharaoh himself.  "
"1345","Genesis","44","19","My lord asked his servants, ‘Do you have a father or a brother?’  "
"1346","Genesis","44","20","And we answered, ‘We have an aged father, and there is a young son born to him in his old age. His brother is dead, and he is the only one of his mother’s sons left, and his father loves him.’ "
"1347","Genesis","44","21","“Then you said to your servants, ‘Bring him down to me so I can see him for myself.’  "
"1348","Genesis","44","22","And we said to my lord, ‘The boy cannot leave his father; if he leaves him, his father will die.’  "
"1349","Genesis","44","23","But you told your servants, ‘Unless your youngest brother comes down with you, you will not see my face again.’  "
"1350","Genesis","44","24","When we went back to your servant my father, we told him what my lord had said. "
"1351","Genesis","44","25","“Then our father said, ‘Go back and buy a little more food.’  "
"1352","Genesis","44","26","But we said, ‘We cannot go down. Only if our youngest brother is with us will we go. We cannot see the man’s face unless our youngest brother is with us.’ "
"1353","Genesis","44","27","“Your servant my father said to us, ‘You know that my wife bore me two sons.  "
"1354","Genesis","44","28","One of them went away from me, and I said, “He has surely been torn to pieces.” And I have not seen him since.  "
"1355","Genesis","44","29","If you take this one from me too and harm comes to him, you will bring my gray head down to the grave in misery.’ "
"1356","Genesis","44","30","“So now, if the boy is not with us when I go back to your servant my father, and if my father, whose life is closely bound up with the boy’s life,  "
"1357","Genesis","44","31","sees that the boy isn’t there, he will die. Your servants will bring the gray head of our father down to the grave in sorrow.  "
"1358","Genesis","44","32","Your servant guaranteed the boy’s safety to my father. I said, ‘If I do not bring him back to you, I will bear the blame before you, my father, all my life!’ "
"1359","Genesis","44","33","“Now then, please let your servant remain here as my lord’s slave in place of the boy, and let the boy return with his brothers.  "
"1360","Genesis","44","34","How can I go back to my father if the boy is not with me? No! Do not let me see the misery that would come on my father.”"
"1361","Genesis","45","1","Then Joseph could no longer control himself before all his attendants, and he cried out, “Have everyone leave my presence!” So there was no one with Joseph when he made himself known to his brothers.  "
"1362","Genesis","45","2","And he wept so loudly that the Egyptians heard him, and Pharaoh’s household heard about it. "
"1363","Genesis","45","3","Joseph said to his brothers, “I am Joseph! Is my father still living?” But his brothers were not able to answer him, because they were terrified at his presence. "
"1364","Genesis","45","4","Then Joseph said to his brothers, “Come close to me.” When they had done so, he said, “I am your brother Joseph, the one you sold into Egypt!  "
"1365","Genesis","45","5","And now, do not be distressed and do not be angry with yourselves for selling me here, because it was to save lives that God sent me ahead of you.  "
"1366","Genesis","45","6","For two years now there has been famine in the land, and for the next five years there will be no plowing and reaping.  "
"1367","Genesis","45","7","But God sent me ahead of you to preserve for you a remnant on earth and to save your lives by a great deliverance. "
"1368","Genesis","45","8","“So then, it was not you who sent me here, but God. He made me father to Pharaoh, lord of his entire household and ruler of all Egypt.  "
"1369","Genesis","45","9","Now hurry back to my father and say to him, ‘This is what your son Joseph says: God has made me lord of all Egypt. Come down to me; don’t delay.  "
"1370","Genesis","45","10","You shall live in the region of Goshen and be near me—you, your children and grandchildren, your flocks and herds, and all you have.  "
"1371","Genesis","45","11","I will provide for you there, because five years of famine are still to come. Otherwise you and your household and all who belong to you will become destitute.’ "
"1372","Genesis","45","12","“You can see for yourselves, and so can my brother Benjamin, that it is really I who am speaking to you.  "
"1373","Genesis","45","13","Tell my father about all the honor accorded me in Egypt and about everything you have seen. And bring my father down here quickly.” "
"1374","Genesis","45","14","Then he threw his arms around his brother Benjamin and wept, and Benjamin embraced him, weeping.  "
"1375","Genesis","45","15","And he kissed all his brothers and wept over them. Afterward his brothers talked with him. "
"1376","Genesis","45","16","When the news reached Pharaoh’s palace that Joseph’s brothers had come, Pharaoh and all his officials were pleased.  "
"1377","Genesis","45","17","Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Tell your brothers, ‘Do this: Load your animals and return to the land of Canaan,  "
"1378","Genesis","45","18","and bring your father and your families back to me. I will give you the best of the land of Egypt and you can enjoy the fat of the land.’ "
"1379","Genesis","45","19","“You are also directed to tell them, ‘Do this: Take some carts from Egypt for your children and your wives, and get your father and come.  "
"1380","Genesis","45","20","Never mind about your belongings, because the best of all Egypt will be yours.’ ” "
"1381","Genesis","45","21","So the sons of Israel did this. Joseph gave them carts, as Pharaoh had commanded, and he also gave them provisions for their journey.  "
"1382","Genesis","45","22","To each of them he gave new clothing, but to Benjamin he gave three hundred shekels  of silver and five sets of clothes.  "
"1383","Genesis","45","23","And this is what he sent to his father: ten donkeys loaded with the best things of Egypt, and ten female donkeys loaded with grain and bread and other provisions for his journey.  "
"1384","Genesis","45","24","Then he sent his brothers away, and as they were leaving he said to them, “Don’t quarrel on the way!” "
"1385","Genesis","45","25","So they went up out of Egypt and came to their father Jacob in the land of Canaan.  "
"1386","Genesis","45","26","They told him, “Joseph is still alive! In fact, he is ruler of all Egypt.” Jacob was stunned; he did not believe them.  "
"1387","Genesis","45","27","But when they told him everything Joseph had said to them, and when he saw the carts Joseph had sent to carry him back, the spirit of their father Jacob revived.  "
"1388","Genesis","45","28","And Israel said, “I’m convinced! My son Joseph is still alive. I will go and see him before I die.”"
"1389","Genesis","46","1","So Israel set out with all that was his, and when he reached Beersheba, he offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac. "
"1390","Genesis","46","2","And God spoke to Israel in a vision at night and said, “Jacob! Jacob!” “Here I am,” he replied. "
"1391","Genesis","46","3","“I am God, the God of your father,” he said. “Do not be afraid to go down to Egypt, for I will make you into a great nation there.  "
"1392","Genesis","46","4","I will go down to Egypt with you, and I will surely bring you back again. And Joseph’s own hand will close your eyes.” "
"1393","Genesis","46","5","Then Jacob left Beersheba, and Israel’s sons took their father Jacob and their children and their wives in the carts that Pharaoh had sent to transport him.  "
"1394","Genesis","46","6","So Jacob and all his offspring went to Egypt, taking with them their livestock and the possessions they had acquired in Canaan.  "
"1395","Genesis","46","7","Jacob brought with him to Egypt his sons and grandsons and his daughters and granddaughters—all his offspring. "
"1396","Genesis","46","8","These are the names of the sons of Israel (Jacob and his descendants) who went to Egypt: Reuben the firstborn of Jacob. "
"1397","Genesis","46","9","The sons of Reuben: Hanok, Pallu, Hezron and Karmi. "
"1398","Genesis","46","10","The sons of Simeon: Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jakin, Zohar and Shaul the son of a Canaanite woman. "
"1399","Genesis","46","11","The sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath and Merari. "
"1400","Genesis","46","12","The sons of Judah: Er, Onan, Shelah, Perez and Zerah (but Er and Onan had died in the land of Canaan). The sons of Perez: "
"1401","Genesis","46","13","The sons of Issachar: Tola, Puah,  Jashub  and Shimron. "
"1402","Genesis","46","14","The sons of Zebulun: Sered, Elon and Jahleel. "
"1403","Genesis","46","15","These were the sons Leah bore to Jacob in Paddan Aram,  besides his daughter Dinah. These sons and daughters of his were thirty-three in all. "
"1404","Genesis","46","16","The sons of Gad: Zephon,  Haggi, Shuni, Ezbon, Eri, Arodi and Areli. "
"1405","Genesis","46","17","The sons of Asher: Imnah, Ishvah, Ishvi and Beriah. Their sister was Serah. The sons of Beriah: "
"1406","Genesis","46","18","These were the children born to Jacob by Zilpah, whom Laban had given to his daughter Leah—sixteen in all. "
"1407","Genesis","46","19","The sons of Jacob’s wife Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin.  "
"1408","Genesis","46","20","In Egypt, Manasseh and Ephraim were born to Joseph by Asenath daughter of Potiphera, priest of On. "
"1409","Genesis","46","21","The sons of Benjamin: Bela, Beker, Ashbel, Gera, Naaman, Ehi, Rosh, Muppim, Huppim and Ard. "
"1410","Genesis","46","22","These were the sons of Rachel who were born to Jacob—fourteen in all. "
"1411","Genesis","46","23","The son of Dan: Hushim. "
"1412","Genesis","46","24","The sons of Naphtali: Jahziel, Guni, Jezer and Shillem. "
"1413","Genesis","46","25","These were the sons born to Jacob by Bilhah, whom Laban had given to his daughter Rachel—seven in all. "
"1414","Genesis","46","26","All those who went to Egypt with Jacob—those who were his direct descendants, not counting his sons’ wives—numbered sixty-six persons.  "
"1415","Genesis","46","27","With the two sons  who had been born to Joseph in Egypt, the members of Jacob’s family, which went to Egypt, were seventy  in all. "
"1416","Genesis","46","28","Now Jacob sent Judah ahead of him to Joseph to get directions to Goshen. When they arrived in the region of Goshen,  "
"1417","Genesis","46","29","Joseph had his chariot made ready and went to Goshen to meet his father Israel. As soon as Joseph appeared before him, he threw his arms around his father  and wept for a long time. "
"1418","Genesis","46","30","Israel said to Joseph, “Now I am ready to die, since I have seen for myself that you are still alive.” "
"1419","Genesis","46","31","Then Joseph said to his brothers and to his father’s household, “I will go up and speak to Pharaoh and will say to him, ‘My brothers and my father’s household, who were living in the land of Canaan, have come to me.  "
"1420","Genesis","46","32","The men are shepherds; they tend livestock, and they have brought along their flocks and herds and everything they own.’  "
"1421","Genesis","46","33","When Pharaoh calls you in and asks, ‘What is your occupation?’  "
"1422","Genesis","46","34","you should answer, ‘Your servants have tended livestock from our boyhood on, just as our fathers did.’ Then you will be allowed to settle in the region of Goshen, for all shepherds are detestable to the Egyptians.”"
"1423","Genesis","47","1","Joseph went and told Pharaoh, “My father and brothers, with their flocks and herds and everything they own, have come from the land of Canaan and are now in Goshen.”  "
"1424","Genesis","47","2","He chose five of his brothers and presented them before Pharaoh. "
"1425","Genesis","47","3","Pharaoh asked the brothers, “What is your occupation?” “Your servants are shepherds,” they replied to Pharaoh, “just as our fathers were.”  "
"1426","Genesis","47","4","They also said to him, “We have come to live here for a while, because the famine is severe in Canaan and your servants’ flocks have no pasture. So now, please let your servants settle in Goshen.” "
"1427","Genesis","47","5","Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Your father and your brothers have come to you,  "
"1428","Genesis","47","6","and the land of Egypt is before you; settle your father and your brothers in the best part of the land. Let them live in Goshen. And if you know of any among them with special ability, put them in charge of my own livestock.” "
"1429","Genesis","47","7","Then Joseph brought his father Jacob in and presented him before Pharaoh. After Jacob blessed  Pharaoh,  "
"1430","Genesis","47","8","Pharaoh asked him, “How old are you?” "
"1431","Genesis","47","9","And Jacob said to Pharaoh, “The years of my pilgrimage are a hundred and thirty. My years have been few and difficult, and they do not equal the years of the pilgrimage of my fathers.”  "
"1432","Genesis","47","10","Then Jacob blessed  Pharaoh and went out from his presence. "
"1433","Genesis","47","11","So Joseph settled his father and his brothers in Egypt and gave them property in the best part of the land, the district of Rameses, as Pharaoh directed.  "
"1434","Genesis","47","12","Joseph also provided his father and his brothers and all his father’s household with food, according to the number of their children. "
"1435","Genesis","47","13","There was no food, however, in the whole region because the famine was severe; both Egypt and Canaan wasted away because of the famine.  "
"1436","Genesis","47","14","Joseph collected all the money that was to be found in Egypt and Canaan in payment for the grain they were buying, and he brought it to Pharaoh’s palace.  "
"1437","Genesis","47","15","When the money of the people of Egypt and Canaan was gone, all Egypt came to Joseph and said, “Give us food. Why should we die before your eyes? Our money is all gone.” "
"1438","Genesis","47","16","“Then bring your livestock,” said Joseph. “I will sell you food in exchange for your livestock, since your money is gone.”  "
"1439","Genesis","47","17","So they brought their livestock to Joseph, and he gave them food in exchange for their horses, their sheep and goats, their cattle and donkeys. And he brought them through that year with food in exchange for all their livestock. "
"1440","Genesis","47","18","When that year was over, they came to him the following year and said, “We cannot hide from our lord the fact that since our money is gone and our livestock belongs to you, there is nothing left for our lord except our bodies and our land.  "
"1441","Genesis","47","19","Why should we perish before your eyes—we and our land as well? Buy us and our land in exchange for food, and we with our land will be in bondage to Pharaoh. Give us seed so that we may live and not die, and that the land may not become desolate.” "
"1442","Genesis","47","20","So Joseph bought all the land in Egypt for Pharaoh. The Egyptians, one and all, sold their fields, because the famine was too severe for them. The land became Pharaoh’s,  "
"1443","Genesis","47","21","and Joseph reduced the people to servitude,  from one end of Egypt to the other.  "
"1444","Genesis","47","22","However, he did not buy the land of the priests, because they received a regular allotment from Pharaoh and had food enough from the allotment Pharaoh gave them. That is why they did not sell their land. "
"1445","Genesis","47","23","Joseph said to the people, “Now that I have bought you and your land today for Pharaoh, here is seed for you so you can plant the ground.  "
"1446","Genesis","47","24","But when the crop comes in, give a fifth of it to Pharaoh. The other four-fifths you may keep as seed for the fields and as food for yourselves and your households and your children.” "
"1447","Genesis","47","25","“You have saved our lives,” they said. “May we find favor in the eyes of our lord; we will be in bondage to Pharaoh.” "
"1448","Genesis","47","26","So Joseph established it as a law concerning land in Egypt—still in force today—that a fifth of the produce belongs to Pharaoh. It was only the land of the priests that did not become Pharaoh’s. "
"1449","Genesis","47","27","Now the Israelites settled in Egypt in the region of Goshen. They acquired property there and were fruitful and increased greatly in number. "
"1450","Genesis","47","28","Jacob lived in Egypt seventeen years, and the years of his life were a hundred and forty-seven.  "
"1451","Genesis","47","29","When the time drew near for Israel to die, he called for his son Joseph and said to him, “If I have found favor in your eyes, put your hand under my thigh and promise that you will show me kindness and faithfulness. Do not bury me in Egypt,  "
"1452","Genesis","47","30","but when I rest with my fathers, carry me out of Egypt and bury me where they are buried.” “I will do as you say,” he said. "
"1453","Genesis","47","31","“Swear to me,” he said. Then Joseph swore to him, and Israel worshiped as he leaned on the top of his staff."
"1454","Genesis","48","1","Some time later Joseph was told, “Your father is ill.” So he took his two sons Manasseh and Ephraim along with him.  "
"1455","Genesis","48","2","When Jacob was told, “Your son Joseph has come to you,” Israel rallied his strength and sat up on the bed. "
"1456","Genesis","48","3","Jacob said to Joseph, “God Almighty  appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and there he blessed me  "
"1457","Genesis","48","4","and said to me, ‘I am going to make you fruitful and increase your numbers. I will make you a community of peoples, and I will give this land as an everlasting possession to your descendants after you.’ "
"1458","Genesis","48","5","“Now then, your two sons born to you in Egypt before I came to you here will be reckoned as mine; Ephraim and Manasseh will be mine, just as Reuben and Simeon are mine.  "
"1459","Genesis","48","6","Any children born to you after them will be yours; in the territory they inherit they will be reckoned under the names of their brothers.  "
"1460","Genesis","48","7","As I was returning from Paddan,  to my sorrow Rachel died in the land of Canaan while we were still on the way, a little distance from Ephrath. So I buried her there beside the road to Ephrath” (that is, Bethlehem). "
"1461","Genesis","48","8","When Israel saw the sons of Joseph, he asked, “Who are these?” "
"1462","Genesis","48","9","“They are the sons God has given me here,” Joseph said to his father. Then Israel said, “Bring them to me so I may bless them.” "
"1463","Genesis","48","10","Now Israel’s eyes were failing because of old age, and he could hardly see. So Joseph brought his sons close to him, and his father kissed them and embraced them. "
"1464","Genesis","48","11","Israel said to Joseph, “I never expected to see your face again, and now God has allowed me to see your children too.” "
"1465","Genesis","48","12","Then Joseph removed them from Israel’s knees and bowed down with his face to the ground.  "
"1466","Genesis","48","13","And Joseph took both of them, Ephraim on his right toward Israel’s left hand and Manasseh on his left toward Israel’s right hand, and brought them close to him.  "
"1467","Genesis","48","14","But Israel reached out his right hand and put it on Ephraim’s head, though he was the younger, and crossing his arms, he put his left hand on Manasseh’s head, even though Manasseh was the firstborn. "
"1468","Genesis","48","15","Then he blessed Joseph and said, “May the God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked faithfully, the God who has been my shepherd all my life to this day, "
"1469","Genesis","48","16","the Angel who has delivered me from all harm —may he bless these boys. May they be called by my name and the names of my fathers Abraham and Isaac, and may they increase greatly on the earth.” "
"1470","Genesis","48","17","When Joseph saw his father placing his right hand on Ephraim’s head he was displeased; so he took hold of his father’s hand to move it from Ephraim’s head to Manasseh’s head.  "
"1471","Genesis","48","18","Joseph said to him, “No, my father, this one is the firstborn; put your right hand on his head.” "
"1472","Genesis","48","19","But his father refused and said, “I know, my son, I know. He too will become a people, and he too will become great. Nevertheless, his younger brother will be greater than he, and his descendants will become a group of nations.”  "
"1473","Genesis","48","20","He blessed them that day and said, “In your  name will Israel pronounce this blessing: ‘May God make you like Ephraim and Manasseh.’ ” So he put Ephraim ahead of Manasseh. "
"1474","Genesis","48","21","Then Israel said to Joseph, “I am about to die, but God will be with you  and take you  back to the land of your  fathers.  "
"1475","Genesis","48","22","And to you I give one more ridge of land  than to your brothers, the ridge I took from the Amorites with my sword and my bow.”"
"1476","Genesis","49","1","Then Jacob called for his sons and said: “Gather around so I can tell you what will happen to you in days to come. "
"1477","Genesis","49","2","“Assemble and listen, sons of Jacob; listen to your father Israel. "
"1478","Genesis","49","3","“Reuben, you are my firstborn, my might, the first sign of my strength, excelling in honor, excelling in power. "
"1479","Genesis","49","4","Turbulent as the waters, you will no longer excel, for you went up onto your father’s bed, onto my couch and defiled it. "
"1480","Genesis","49","5","“Simeon and Levi are brothers— their swords  are weapons of violence. "
"1481","Genesis","49","6","Let me not enter their council, let me not join their assembly, for they have killed men in their anger and hamstrung oxen as they pleased. "
"1482","Genesis","49","7","Cursed be their anger, so fierce, and their fury, so cruel! I will scatter them in Jacob and disperse them in Israel. "
"1483","Genesis","49","8","“Judah,  your brothers will praise you; your hand will be on the neck of your enemies; your father’s sons will bow down to you. "
"1484","Genesis","49","9","You are a lion’s cub, Judah; you return from the prey, my son. Like a lion he crouches and lies down, like a lioness—who dares to rouse him? "
"1485","Genesis","49","10","The scepter will not depart from Judah, nor the ruler’s staff from between his feet, until he to whom it belongs  shall come and the obedience of the nations shall be his. "
"1486","Genesis","49","11","He will tether his donkey to a vine, his colt to the choicest branch; he will wash his garments in wine, his robes in the blood of grapes. "
"1487","Genesis","49","12","His eyes will be darker than wine, his teeth whiter than milk. "
"1488","Genesis","49","13","“Zebulun will live by the seashore and become a haven for ships; his border will extend toward Sidon. "
"1489","Genesis","49","14","“Issachar is a rawboned  donkey lying down among the sheep pens. "
"1490","Genesis","49","15","When he sees how good is his resting place and how pleasant is his land, he will bend his shoulder to the burden and submit to forced labor. "
"1491","Genesis","49","16","“Dan  will provide justice for his people as one of the tribes of Israel. "
"1492","Genesis","49","17","Dan will be a snake by the roadside, a viper along the path, that bites the horse’s heels so that its rider tumbles backward. "
"1493","Genesis","49","18","“I look for your deliverance,  Lord . "
"1494","Genesis","49","19","“Gad  will be attacked by a band of raiders, but he will attack them at their heels. "
"1495","Genesis","49","20","“Asher’s food will be rich; he will provide delicacies fit for a king. "
"1496","Genesis","49","21","“Naphtali is a doe set free that bears beautiful fawns. "
"1497","Genesis","49","22","“Joseph is a fruitful vine, a fruitful vine near a spring, whose branches climb over a wall. "
"1498","Genesis","49","23","With bitterness archers attacked him; they shot at him with hostility. "
"1499","Genesis","49","24","But his bow remained steady, his strong arms stayed  limber, because of the hand of the Mighty One of Jacob, because of the Shepherd, the Rock of Israel, "
"1500","Genesis","49","25","because of your father’s God, who helps you, because of the Almighty,  who blesses you with blessings of the skies above, blessings of the deep springs below, blessings of the breast and womb. "
"1501","Genesis","49","26","Your father’s blessings are greater than the blessings of the ancient mountains, than  the bounty of the age-old hills. Let all these rest on the head of Joseph, on the brow of the prince among  his brothers. "
"1502","Genesis","49","27","“Benjamin is a ravenous wolf; in the morning he devours the prey, in the evening he divides the plunder.” "
"1503","Genesis","49","28","All these are the twelve tribes of Israel, and this is what their father said to them when he blessed them, giving each the blessing appropriate to him. "
"1504","Genesis","49","29","Then he gave them these instructions: “I am about to be gathered to my people. Bury me with my fathers in the cave in the field of Ephron the Hittite,  "
"1505","Genesis","49","30","the cave in the field of Machpelah, near Mamre in Canaan, which Abraham bought along with the field as a burial place from Ephron the Hittite.  "
"1506","Genesis","49","31","There Abraham and his wife Sarah were buried, there Isaac and his wife Rebekah were buried, and there I buried Leah.  "
"1507","Genesis","49","32","The field and the cave in it were bought from the Hittites. ” "
"1508","Genesis","49","33","When Jacob had finished giving instructions to his sons, he drew his feet up into the bed, breathed his last and was gathered to his people."
"1509","Genesis","50","1","Joseph threw himself on his father and wept over him and kissed him.  "
"1510","Genesis","50","2","Then Joseph directed the physicians in his service to embalm his father Israel. So the physicians embalmed him,  "
"1511","Genesis","50","3","taking a full forty days, for that was the time required for embalming. And the Egyptians mourned for him seventy days. "
"1512","Genesis","50","4","When the days of mourning had passed, Joseph said to Pharaoh’s court, “If I have found favor in your eyes, speak to Pharaoh for me. Tell him,  "
"1513","Genesis","50","5","‘My father made me swear an oath and said, “I am about to die; bury me in the tomb I dug for myself in the land of Canaan.” Now let me go up and bury my father; then I will return.’ ” "
"1514","Genesis","50","6","Pharaoh said, “Go up and bury your father, as he made you swear to do.” "
"1515","Genesis","50","7","So Joseph went up to bury his father. All Pharaoh’s officials accompanied him—the dignitaries of his court and all the dignitaries of Egypt—  "
"1516","Genesis","50","8","besides all the members of Joseph’s household and his brothers and those belonging to his father’s household. Only their children and their flocks and herds were left in Goshen.  "
"1517","Genesis","50","9","Chariots and horsemen  also went up with him. It was a very large company. "
"1518","Genesis","50","10","When they reached the threshing floor of Atad, near the Jordan, they lamented loudly and bitterly; and there Joseph observed a seven-day period of mourning for his father.  "
"1519","Genesis","50","11","When the Canaanites who lived there saw the mourning at the threshing floor of Atad, they said, “The Egyptians are holding a solemn ceremony of mourning.” That is why that place near the Jordan is called Abel Mizraim. "
"1520","Genesis","50","12","So Jacob’s sons did as he had commanded them:  "
"1521","Genesis","50","13","They carried him to the land of Canaan and buried him in the cave in the field of Machpelah, near Mamre, which Abraham had bought along with the field as a burial place from Ephron the Hittite.  "
"1522","Genesis","50","14","After burying his father, Joseph returned to Egypt, together with his brothers and all the others who had gone with him to bury his father. "
"1523","Genesis","50","15","When Joseph’s brothers saw that their father was dead, they said, “What if Joseph holds a grudge against us and pays us back for all the wrongs we did to him?”  "
"1524","Genesis","50","16","So they sent word to Joseph, saying, “Your father left these instructions before he died:  "
"1525","Genesis","50","17","‘This is what you are to say to Joseph: I ask you to forgive your brothers the sins and the wrongs they committed in treating you so badly.’ Now please forgive the sins of the servants of the God of your father.” When their message came to him, Joseph wept. "
"1526","Genesis","50","18","His brothers then came and threw themselves down before him. “We are your slaves,” they said. "
"1527","Genesis","50","19","But Joseph said to them, “Don’t be afraid. Am I in the place of God?  "
"1528","Genesis","50","20","You intended to harm me, but God intended it for good to accomplish what is now being done, the saving of many lives.  "
"1529","Genesis","50","21","So then, don’t be afraid. I will provide for you and your children.” And he reassured them and spoke kindly to them. "
"1530","Genesis","50","22","Joseph stayed in Egypt, along with all his father’s family. He lived a hundred and ten years  "
"1531","Genesis","50","23","and saw the third generation of Ephraim’s children. Also the children of Makir son of Manasseh were placed at birth on Joseph’s knees. "
"1532","Genesis","50","24","Then Joseph said to his brothers, “I am about to die. But God will surely come to your aid and take you up out of this land to the land he promised on oath to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.”  "
"1533","Genesis","50","25","And Joseph made the Israelites swear an oath and said, “God will surely come to your aid, and then you must carry my bones up from this place.” "
"1534","Genesis","50","26","So Joseph died at the age of a hundred and ten. And after they embalmed him, he was placed in a coffin in Egypt."
"1535","Exodus","1","1","These are the names of the sons of Israel who went to Egypt with Jacob, each with his family:  "
"1536","Exodus","1","2","Reuben, Simeon, Levi and Judah;  "
"1537","Exodus","1","3","Issachar, Zebulun and Benjamin;  "
"1538","Exodus","1","4","Dan and Naphtali; Gad and Asher.  "
"1539","Exodus","1","5","The descendants of Jacob numbered seventy  in all; Joseph was already in Egypt. "
"1540","Exodus","1","6","Now Joseph and all his brothers and all that generation died,  "
"1541","Exodus","1","7","but the Israelites were exceedingly fruitful; they multiplied greatly, increased in numbers and became so numerous that the land was filled with them. "
"1542","Exodus","1","8","Then a new king, to whom Joseph meant nothing, came to power in Egypt.  "
"1543","Exodus","1","9","“Look,” he said to his people, “the Israelites have become far too numerous for us.  "
"1544","Exodus","1","10","Come, we must deal shrewdly with them or they will become even more numerous and, if war breaks out, will join our enemies, fight against us and leave the country.” "
"1545","Exodus","1","11","So they put slave masters over them to oppress them with forced labor, and they built Pithom and Rameses as store cities for Pharaoh.  "
"1546","Exodus","1","12","But the more they were oppressed, the more they multiplied and spread; so the Egyptians came to dread the Israelites  "
"1547","Exodus","1","13","and worked them ruthlessly.  "
"1548","Exodus","1","14","They made their lives bitter with harsh labor in brick and mortar and with all kinds of work in the fields; in all their harsh labor the Egyptians worked them ruthlessly. "
"1549","Exodus","1","15","The king of Egypt said to the Hebrew midwives, whose names were Shiphrah and Puah,  "
"1550","Exodus","1","16","“When you are helping the Hebrew women during childbirth on the delivery stool, if you see that the baby is a boy, kill him; but if it is a girl, let her live.”  "
"1551","Exodus","1","17","The midwives, however, feared God and did not do what the king of Egypt had told them to do; they let the boys live.  "
"1552","Exodus","1","18","Then the king of Egypt summoned the midwives and asked them, “Why have you done this? Why have you let the boys live?” "
"1553","Exodus","1","19","The midwives answered Pharaoh, “Hebrew women are not like Egyptian women; they are vigorous and give birth before the midwives arrive.” "
"1554","Exodus","1","20","So God was kind to the midwives and the people increased and became even more numerous.  "
"1555","Exodus","1","21","And because the midwives feared God, he gave them families of their own. "
"1556","Exodus","1","22","Then Pharaoh gave this order to all his people: “Every Hebrew boy that is born you must throw into the Nile, but let every girl live.”"
"1557","Exodus","2","1","Now a man of the tribe of Levi married a Levite woman,  "
"1558","Exodus","2","2","and she became pregnant and gave birth to a son. When she saw that he was a fine child, she hid him for three months.  "
"1559","Exodus","2","3","But when she could hide him no longer, she got a papyrus basket  for him and coated it with tar and pitch. Then she placed the child in it and put it among the reeds along the bank of the Nile.  "
"1560","Exodus","2","4","His sister stood at a distance to see what would happen to him. "
"1561","Exodus","2","5","Then Pharaoh’s daughter went down to the Nile to bathe, and her attendants were walking along the riverbank. She saw the basket among the reeds and sent her female slave to get it.  "
"1562","Exodus","2","6","She opened it and saw the baby. He was crying, and she felt sorry for him. “This is one of the Hebrew babies,” she said. "
"1563","Exodus","2","7","Then his sister asked Pharaoh’s daughter, “Shall I go and get one of the Hebrew women to nurse the baby for you?” "
"1564","Exodus","2","8","“Yes, go,” she answered. So the girl went and got the baby’s mother.  "
"1565","Exodus","2","9","Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, “Take this baby and nurse him for me, and I will pay you.” So the woman took the baby and nursed him.  "
"1566","Exodus","2","10","When the child grew older, she took him to Pharaoh’s daughter and he became her son. She named him Moses,  saying, “I drew him out of the water.” "
"1567","Exodus","2","11","One day, after Moses had grown up, he went out to where his own people were and watched them at their hard labor. He saw an Egyptian beating a Hebrew, one of his own people.  "
"1568","Exodus","2","12","Looking this way and that and seeing no one, he killed the Egyptian and hid him in the sand.  "
"1569","Exodus","2","13","The next day he went out and saw two Hebrews fighting. He asked the one in the wrong, “Why are you hitting your fellow Hebrew?” "
"1570","Exodus","2","14","The man said, “Who made you ruler and judge over us? Are you thinking of killing me as you killed the Egyptian?” Then Moses was afraid and thought, “What I did must have become known.” "
"1571","Exodus","2","15","When Pharaoh heard of this, he tried to kill Moses, but Moses fled from Pharaoh and went to live in Midian, where he sat down by a well.  "
"1572","Exodus","2","16","Now a priest of Midian had seven daughters, and they came to draw water and fill the troughs to water their father’s flock.  "
"1573","Exodus","2","17","Some shepherds came along and drove them away, but Moses got up and came to their rescue and watered their flock. "
"1574","Exodus","2","18","When the girls returned to Reuel their father, he asked them, “Why have you returned so early today?” "
"1575","Exodus","2","19","They answered, “An Egyptian rescued us from the shepherds. He even drew water for us and watered the flock.” "
"1576","Exodus","2","20","“And where is he?” Reuel asked his daughters. “Why did you leave him? Invite him to have something to eat.” "
"1577","Exodus","2","21","Moses agreed to stay with the man, who gave his daughter Zipporah to Moses in marriage.  "
"1578","Exodus","2","22","Zipporah gave birth to a son, and Moses named him Gershom,  saying, “I have become a foreigner in a foreign land.” "
"1579","Exodus","2","23","During that long period, the king of Egypt died. The Israelites groaned in their slavery and cried out, and their cry for help because of their slavery went up to God.  "
"1580","Exodus","2","24","God heard their groaning and he remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac and with Jacob.  "
"1581","Exodus","2","25","So God looked on the Israelites and was concerned about them."
"1582","Exodus","3","1","Now Moses was tending the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the priest of Midian, and he led the flock to the far side of the wilderness and came to Horeb, the mountain of God.  "
"1583","Exodus","3","2","There the angel of the  Lord  appeared to him in flames of fire from within a bush. Moses saw that though the bush was on fire it did not burn up.  "
"1584","Exodus","3","3","So Moses thought, “I will go over and see this strange sight—why the bush does not burn up.” "
"1585","Exodus","3","4","When the  Lord  saw that he had gone over to look, God called to him from within the bush, “Moses! Moses!” And Moses said, “Here I am.” "
"1586","Exodus","3","5","“Do not come any closer,” God said. “Take off your sandals, for the place where you are standing is holy ground.”  "
"1587","Exodus","3","6","Then he said, “I am the God of your father,  the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob.” At this, Moses hid his face, because he was afraid to look at God. "
"1588","Exodus","3","7","The  Lord  said, “I have indeed seen the misery of my people in Egypt. I have heard them crying out because of their slave drivers, and I am concerned about their suffering.  "
"1589","Exodus","3","8","So I have come down to rescue them from the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land into a good and spacious land, a land flowing with milk and honey—the home of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites.  "
"1590","Exodus","3","9","And now the cry of the Israelites has reached me, and I have seen the way the Egyptians are oppressing them.  "
"1591","Exodus","3","10","So now, go. I am sending you to Pharaoh to bring my people the Israelites out of Egypt.” "
"1592","Exodus","3","11","But Moses said to God, “Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh and bring the Israelites out of Egypt?” "
"1593","Exodus","3","12","And God said, “I will be with you. And this will be the sign to you that it is I who have sent you: When you have brought the people out of Egypt, you  will worship God on this mountain.” "
"1594","Exodus","3","13","Moses said to God, “Suppose I go to the Israelites and say to them, ‘The God of your fathers has sent me to you,’ and they ask me, ‘What is his name?’ Then what shall I tell them?” "
"1595","Exodus","3","14","God said to Moses, “ I am who I am .  This is what you are to say to the Israelites: ‘ I am  has sent me to you.’ ” "
"1596","Exodus","3","15","God also said to Moses, “Say to the Israelites, ‘The  Lord ,  the God of your fathers—the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob—has sent me to you.’ “This is my name forever, the name you shall call me from generation to generation. "
"1597","Exodus","3","16","“Go, assemble the elders of Israel and say to them, ‘The  Lord , the God of your fathers—the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob—appeared to me and said: I have watched over you and have seen what has been done to you in Egypt.  "
"1598","Exodus","3","17","And I have promised to bring you up out of your misery in Egypt into the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites—a land flowing with milk and honey.’ "
"1599","Exodus","3","18","“The elders of Israel will listen to you. Then you and the elders are to go to the king of Egypt and say to him, ‘The  Lord , the God of the Hebrews, has met with us. Let us take a three-day journey into the wilderness to offer sacrifices to the  Lord  our God.’  "
"1600","Exodus","3","19","But I know that the king of Egypt will not let you go unless a mighty hand compels him.  "
"1601","Exodus","3","20","So I will stretch out my hand and strike the Egyptians with all the wonders that I will perform among them. After that, he will let you go. "
"1602","Exodus","3","21","“And I will make the Egyptians favorably disposed toward this people, so that when you leave you will not go empty-handed.  "
"1603","Exodus","3","22","Every woman is to ask her neighbor and any woman living in her house for articles of silver and gold and for clothing, which you will put on your sons and daughters. And so you will plunder the Egyptians.”"
"1604","Exodus","4","1","Moses answered, “What if they do not believe me or listen to me and say, ‘The  Lord  did not appear to you’?” "
"1605","Exodus","4","2","Then the  Lord  said to him, “What is that in your hand?” “A staff,” he replied. "
"1606","Exodus","4","3","The  Lord  said, “Throw it on the ground.” Moses threw it on the ground and it became a snake, and he ran from it.  "
"1607","Exodus","4","4","Then the  Lord  said to him, “Reach out your hand and take it by the tail.” So Moses reached out and took hold of the snake and it turned back into a staff in his hand.  "
"1608","Exodus","4","5","“This,” said the  Lord , “is so that they may believe that the  Lord , the God of their fathers—the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob—has appeared to you.” "
"1609","Exodus","4","6","Then the  Lord  said, “Put your hand inside your cloak.” So Moses put his hand into his cloak, and when he took it out, the skin was leprous —it had become as white as snow. "
"1610","Exodus","4","7","“Now put it back into your cloak,” he said. So Moses put his hand back into his cloak, and when he took it out, it was restored, like the rest of his flesh. "
"1611","Exodus","4","8","Then the  Lord  said, “If they do not believe you or pay attention to the first sign, they may believe the second.  "
"1612","Exodus","4","9","But if they do not believe these two signs or listen to you, take some water from the Nile and pour it on the dry ground. The water you take from the river will become blood on the ground.” "
"1613","Exodus","4","10","Moses said to the  Lord , “Pardon your servant, Lord. I have never been eloquent, neither in the past nor since you have spoken to your servant. I am slow of speech and tongue.” "
"1614","Exodus","4","11","The  Lord  said to him, “Who gave human beings their mouths? Who makes them deaf or mute? Who gives them sight or makes them blind? Is it not I, the  Lord ?  "
"1615","Exodus","4","12","Now go; I will help you speak and will teach you what to say.” "
"1616","Exodus","4","13","But Moses said, “Pardon your servant, Lord. Please send someone else.” "
"1617","Exodus","4","14","Then the  Lord ’s anger burned against Moses and he said, “What about your brother, Aaron the Levite? I know he can speak well. He is already on his way to meet you, and he will be glad to see you.  "
"1618","Exodus","4","15","You shall speak to him and put words in his mouth; I will help both of you speak and will teach you what to do.  "
"1619","Exodus","4","16","He will speak to the people for you, and it will be as if he were your mouth and as if you were God to him.  "
"1620","Exodus","4","17","But take this staff in your hand so you can perform the signs with it.” "
"1621","Exodus","4","18","Then Moses went back to Jethro his father-in-law and said to him, “Let me return to my own people in Egypt to see if any of them are still alive.” Jethro said, “Go, and I wish you well.” "
"1622","Exodus","4","19","Now the  Lord  had said to Moses in Midian, “Go back to Egypt, for all those who wanted to kill you are dead.”  "
"1623","Exodus","4","20","So Moses took his wife and sons, put them on a donkey and started back to Egypt. And he took the staff of God in his hand. "
"1624","Exodus","4","21","The  Lord  said to Moses, “When you return to Egypt, see that you perform before Pharaoh all the wonders I have given you the power to do. But I will harden his heart so that he will not let the people go.  "
"1625","Exodus","4","22","Then say to Pharaoh, ‘This is what the  Lord  says: Israel is my firstborn son,  "
"1626","Exodus","4","23","and I told you, “Let my son go, so he may worship me.” But you refused to let him go; so I will kill your firstborn son.’ ” "
"1627","Exodus","4","24","At a lodging place on the way, the  Lord  met Moses  and was about to kill him.  "
"1628","Exodus","4","25","But Zipporah took a flint knife, cut off her son’s foreskin and touched Moses’ feet with it.  “Surely you are a bridegroom of blood to me,” she said.  "
"1629","Exodus","4","26","So the  Lord  let him alone. (At that time she said “bridegroom of blood,” referring to circumcision.) "
"1630","Exodus","4","27","The  Lord  said to Aaron, “Go into the wilderness to meet Moses.” So he met Moses at the mountain of God and kissed him.  "
"1631","Exodus","4","28","Then Moses told Aaron everything the  Lord  had sent him to say, and also about all the signs he had commanded him to perform. "
"1632","Exodus","4","29","Moses and Aaron brought together all the elders of the Israelites,  "
"1633","Exodus","4","30","and Aaron told them everything the  Lord  had said to Moses. He also performed the signs before the people,  "
"1634","Exodus","4","31","and they believed. And when they heard that the  Lord  was concerned about them and had seen their misery, they bowed down and worshiped."
"1635","Exodus","5","1","Afterward Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and said, “This is what the  Lord , the God of Israel, says: ‘Let my people go, so that they may hold a festival to me in the wilderness.’ ” "
"1636","Exodus","5","2","Pharaoh said, “Who is the  Lord , that I should obey him and let Israel go? I do not know the  Lord  and I will not let Israel go.” "
"1637","Exodus","5","3","Then they said, “The God of the Hebrews has met with us. Now let us take a three-day journey into the wilderness to offer sacrifices to the  Lord  our God, or he may strike us with plagues or with the sword.” "
"1638","Exodus","5","4","But the king of Egypt said, “Moses and Aaron, why are you taking the people away from their labor? Get back to your work!”  "
"1639","Exodus","5","5","Then Pharaoh said, “Look, the people of the land are now numerous, and you are stopping them from working.” "
"1640","Exodus","5","6","That same day Pharaoh gave this order to the slave drivers and overseers in charge of the people:  "
"1641","Exodus","5","7","“You are no longer to supply the people with straw for making bricks; let them go and gather their own straw.  "
"1642","Exodus","5","8","But require them to make the same number of bricks as before; don’t reduce the quota. They are lazy; that is why they are crying out, ‘Let us go and sacrifice to our God.’  "
"1643","Exodus","5","9","Make the work harder for the people so that they keep working and pay no attention to lies.” "
"1644","Exodus","5","10","Then the slave drivers and the overseers went out and said to the people, “This is what Pharaoh says: ‘I will not give you any more straw.  "
"1645","Exodus","5","11","Go and get your own straw wherever you can find it, but your work will not be reduced at all.’ ”  "
"1646","Exodus","5","12","So the people scattered all over Egypt to gather stubble to use for straw.  "
"1647","Exodus","5","13","The slave drivers kept pressing them, saying, “Complete the work required of you for each day, just as when you had straw.”  "
"1648","Exodus","5","14","And Pharaoh’s slave drivers beat the Israelite overseers they had appointed, demanding, “Why haven’t you met your quota of bricks yesterday or today, as before?” "
"1649","Exodus","5","15","Then the Israelite overseers went and appealed to Pharaoh: “Why have you treated your servants this way?  "
"1650","Exodus","5","16","Your servants are given no straw, yet we are told, ‘Make bricks!’ Your servants are being beaten, but the fault is with your own people.” "
"1651","Exodus","5","17","Pharaoh said, “Lazy, that’s what you are—lazy! That is why you keep saying, ‘Let us go and sacrifice to the  Lord .’  "
"1652","Exodus","5","18","Now get to work. You will not be given any straw, yet you must produce your full quota of bricks.” "
"1653","Exodus","5","19","The Israelite overseers realized they were in trouble when they were told, “You are not to reduce the number of bricks required of you for each day.”  "
"1654","Exodus","5","20","When they left Pharaoh, they found Moses and Aaron waiting to meet them,  "
"1655","Exodus","5","21","and they said, “May the  Lord  look on you and judge you! You have made us obnoxious to Pharaoh and his officials and have put a sword in their hand to kill us.” "
"1656","Exodus","5","22","Moses returned to the  Lord  and said, “Why, Lord, why have you brought trouble on this people? Is this why you sent me?  "
"1657","Exodus","5","23","Ever since I went to Pharaoh to speak in your name, he has brought trouble on this people, and you have not rescued your people at all.”"
"1658","Exodus","6","1","Then the  Lord  said to Moses, “Now you will see what I will do to Pharaoh: Because of my mighty hand he will let them go; because of my mighty hand he will drive them out of his country.” "
"1659","Exodus","6","2","God also said to Moses, “I am the  Lord .  "
"1660","Exodus","6","3","I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac and to Jacob as God Almighty,  but by my name the  Lord  I did not make myself fully known to them.  "
"1661","Exodus","6","4","I also established my covenant with them to give them the land of Canaan, where they resided as foreigners.  "
"1662","Exodus","6","5","Moreover, I have heard the groaning of the Israelites, whom the Egyptians are enslaving, and I have remembered my covenant. "
"1663","Exodus","6","6","“Therefore, say to the Israelites: ‘I am the  Lord , and I will bring you out from under the yoke of the Egyptians. I will free you from being slaves to them, and I will redeem you with an outstretched arm and with mighty acts of judgment.  "
"1664","Exodus","6","7","I will take you as my own people, and I will be your God. Then you will know that I am the  Lord  your God, who brought you out from under the yoke of the Egyptians.  "
"1665","Exodus","6","8","And I will bring you to the land I swore with uplifted hand to give to Abraham, to Isaac and to Jacob. I will give it to you as a possession. I am the  Lord .’ ” "
"1666","Exodus","6","9","Moses reported this to the Israelites, but they did not listen to him because of their discouragement and harsh labor. "
"1667","Exodus","6","10","Then the  Lord  said to Moses,  "
"1668","Exodus","6","11","“Go, tell Pharaoh king of Egypt to let the Israelites go out of his country.” "
"1669","Exodus","6","12","But Moses said to the  Lord , “If the Israelites will not listen to me, why would Pharaoh listen to me, since I speak with faltering lips ?” "
"1670","Exodus","6","13","Now the  Lord  spoke to Moses and Aaron about the Israelites and Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he commanded them to bring the Israelites out of Egypt. "

"1684","Exodus","6","27","They were the ones who spoke to Pharaoh king of Egypt about bringing the Israelites out of Egypt—this same Moses and Aaron. "
"1685","Exodus","6","28","Now when the  Lord  spoke to Moses in Egypt,  "
"1686","Exodus","6","29","he said to him, “I am the  Lord . Tell Pharaoh king of Egypt everything I tell you.” "
"1687","Exodus","6","30","But Moses said to the  Lord , “Since I speak with faltering lips, why would Pharaoh listen to me?”"

"1693","Exodus","7","6","Moses and Aaron did just as the  Lord  commanded them.  "
"1694","Exodus","7","7","Moses was eighty years old and Aaron eighty-three when they spoke to Pharaoh. "
"1695","Exodus","7","8","The  Lord  said to Moses and Aaron,  "

"1698","Exodus","7","11","Pharaoh then summoned wise men and sorcerers, and the Egyptian magicians also did the same things by their secret arts:  "
"1699","Exodus","7","12","Each one threw down his staff and it became a snake. But Aaron’s staff swallowed up their staffs.  "
"1700","Exodus","7","13","Yet Pharaoh’s heart became hard and he would not listen to them, just as the  Lord  had said. "
"1701","Exodus","7","14","Then the  Lord  said to Moses, “Pharaoh’s heart is unyielding; he refuses to let the people go.  "
"1702","Exodus","7","15","Go to Pharaoh in the morning as he goes out to the river. Confront him on the bank of the Nile, and take in your hand the staff that was changed into a snake.  "
"1703","Exodus","7","16","Then say to him, ‘The  Lord , the God of the Hebrews, has sent me to say to you: Let my people go, so that they may worship me in the wilderness. But until now you have not listened.  "
"1704","Exodus","7","17","This is what the  Lord  says: By this you will know that I am the  Lord : With the staff that is in my hand I will strike the water of the Nile, and it will be changed into blood.  "
"1705","Exodus","7","18","The fish in the Nile will die, and the river will stink; the Egyptians will not be able to drink its water.’ ” "
"1706","Exodus","7","19","The  Lord  said to Moses, “Tell Aaron, ‘Take your staff and stretch out your hand over the waters of Egypt—over the streams and canals, over the ponds and all the reservoirs—and they will turn to blood.’ Blood will be everywhere in Egypt, even in vessels  of wood and stone.” "
"1707","Exodus","7","20","Moses and Aaron did just as the  Lord  had commanded. He raised his staff in the presence of Pharaoh and his officials and struck the water of the Nile, and all the water was changed into blood.  "
"1708","Exodus","7","21","The fish in the Nile died, and the river smelled so bad that the Egyptians could not drink its water. Blood was everywhere in Egypt. "
"1709","Exodus","7","22","But the Egyptian magicians did the same things by their secret arts, and Pharaoh’s heart became hard; he would not listen to Moses and Aaron, just as the  Lord  had said.  "
"1710","Exodus","7","23","Instead, he turned and went into his palace, and did not take even this to heart.  "
"1711","Exodus","7","24","And all the Egyptians dug along the Nile to get drinking water, because they could not drink the water of the river. "

"1714","Exodus","8","1","Then the  Lord  said to Moses, “Go to Pharaoh and say to him, ‘This is what the  Lord  says: Let my people go, so that they may worship me.  "
"1715","Exodus","8","2","If you refuse to let them go, I will send a plague of frogs on your whole country.  "
"1716","Exodus","8","3","The Nile will teem with frogs. They will come up into your palace and your bedroom and onto your bed, into the houses of your officials and on your people, and into your ovens and kneading troughs.  "
"1717","Exodus","8","4","The frogs will come up on you and your people and all your officials.’ ” "
"1718","Exodus","8","5","Then the  Lord  said to Moses, “Tell Aaron, ‘Stretch out your hand with your staff over the streams and canals and ponds, and make frogs come up on the land of Egypt.’ ” "
"1719","Exodus","8","6","So Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt, and the frogs came up and covered the land.  "
"1720","Exodus","8","7","But the magicians did the same things by their secret arts; they also made frogs come up on the land of Egypt. "
"1721","Exodus","8","8","Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron and said, “Pray to the  Lord  to take the frogs away from me and my people, and I will let your people go to offer sacrifices to the  Lord .” "
"1722","Exodus","8","9","Moses said to Pharaoh, “I leave to you the honor of setting the time for me to pray for you and your officials and your people that you and your houses may be rid of the frogs, except for those that remain in the Nile.” "
"1723","Exodus","8","10","“Tomorrow,” Pharaoh said. Moses replied, “It will be as you say, so that you may know there is no one like the  Lord  our God.  "
"1724","Exodus","8","11","The frogs will leave you and your houses, your officials and your people; they will remain only in the Nile.” "
"1725","Exodus","8","12","After Moses and Aaron left Pharaoh, Moses cried out to the  Lord  about the frogs he had brought on Pharaoh.  "
"1726","Exodus","8","13","And the  Lord  did what Moses asked. The frogs died in the houses, in the courtyards and in the fields.  "
"1727","Exodus","8","14","They were piled into heaps, and the land reeked of them.  "
"1728","Exodus","8","15","But when Pharaoh saw that there was relief, he hardened his heart and would not listen to Moses and Aaron, just as the  Lord  had said. "
"1729","Exodus","8","16","Then the  Lord  said to Moses, “Tell Aaron, ‘Stretch out your staff and strike the dust of the ground,’ and throughout the land of Egypt the dust will become gnats.”  "
"1730","Exodus","8","17","They did this, and when Aaron stretched out his hand with the staff and struck the dust of the ground, gnats came on people and animals. All the dust throughout the land of Egypt became gnats.  "
"1731","Exodus","8","18","But when the magicians tried to produce gnats by their secret arts, they could not. Since the gnats were on people and animals everywhere,  "
"1732","Exodus","8","19","the magicians said to Pharaoh, “This is the finger of God.” But Pharaoh’s heart was hard and he would not listen, just as the  Lord  had said. "
"1733","Exodus","8","20","Then the  Lord  said to Moses, “Get up early in the morning and confront Pharaoh as he goes to the river and say to him, ‘This is what the  Lord  says: Let my people go, so that they may worship me.  "
"1734","Exodus","8","21","If you do not let my people go, I will send swarms of flies on you and your officials, on your people and into your houses. The houses of the Egyptians will be full of flies; even the ground will be covered with them. "
"1735","Exodus","8","22","“ ‘But on that day I will deal differently with the land of Goshen, where my people live; no swarms of flies will be there, so that you will know that I, the  Lord , am in this land.  "
"1736","Exodus","8","23","I will make a distinction  between my people and your people. This sign will occur tomorrow.’ ” "
"1737","Exodus","8","24","And the  Lord  did this. Dense swarms of flies poured into Pharaoh’s palace and into the houses of his officials; throughout Egypt the land was ruined by the flies. "
"1738","Exodus","8","25","Then Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron and said, “Go, sacrifice to your God here in the land.” "
"1739","Exodus","8","26","But Moses said, “That would not be right. The sacrifices we offer the  Lord  our God would be detestable to the Egyptians. And if we offer sacrifices that are detestable in their eyes, will they not stone us?  "
"1740","Exodus","8","27","We must take a three-day journey into the wilderness to offer sacrifices to the  Lord  our God, as he commands us.” "
"1741","Exodus","8","28","Pharaoh said, “I will let you go to offer sacrifices to the  Lord  your God in the wilderness, but you must not go very far. Now pray for me.” "
"1742","Exodus","8","29","Moses answered, “As soon as I leave you, I will pray to the  Lord , and tomorrow the flies will leave Pharaoh and his officials and his people. Only let Pharaoh be sure that he does not act deceitfully again by not letting the people go to offer sacrifices to the  Lord .” "
"1743","Exodus","8","30","Then Moses left Pharaoh and prayed to the  Lord ,  "
"1744","Exodus","8","31","and the  Lord  did what Moses asked. The flies left Pharaoh and his officials and his people; not a fly remained.  "
"1745","Exodus","8","32","But this time also Pharaoh hardened his heart and would not let the people go."
"1746","Exodus","9","1","Then the  Lord  said to Moses, “Go to Pharaoh and say to him, ‘This is what the  Lord , the God of the Hebrews, says: “Let my people go, so that they may worship me.”  "
"1747","Exodus","9","2","If you refuse to let them go and continue to hold them back,  "
"1748","Exodus","9","3","the hand of the  Lord  will bring a terrible plague on your livestock in the field—on your horses, donkeys and camels and on your cattle, sheep and goats.  "
"1749","Exodus","9","4","But the  Lord  will make a distinction between the livestock of Israel and that of Egypt, so that no animal belonging to the Israelites will die.’ ” "
"1750","Exodus","9","5","The  Lord  set a time and said, “Tomorrow the  Lord  will do this in the land.”  "
"1751","Exodus","9","6","And the next day the  Lord  did it: All the livestock of the Egyptians died, but not one animal belonging to the Israelites died.  "
"1752","Exodus","9","7","Pharaoh investigated and found that not even one of the animals of the Israelites had died. Yet his heart was unyielding and he would not let the people go. "
"1753","Exodus","9","8","Then the  Lord  said to Moses and Aaron, “Take handfuls of soot from a furnace and have Moses toss it into the air in the presence of Pharaoh.  "
"1754","Exodus","9","9","It will become fine dust over the whole land of Egypt, and festering boils will break out on people and animals throughout the land.” "
"1755","Exodus","9","10","So they took soot from a furnace and stood before Pharaoh. Moses tossed it into the air, and festering boils broke out on people and animals.  "
"1756","Exodus","9","11","The magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils that were on them and on all the Egyptians.  "
"1757","Exodus","9","12","But the  Lord  hardened Pharaoh’s heart and he would not listen to Moses and Aaron, just as the  Lord  had said to Moses. "
"1758","Exodus","9","13","Then the  Lord  said to Moses, “Get up early in the morning, confront Pharaoh and say to him, ‘This is what the  Lord , the God of the Hebrews, says: Let my people go, so that they may worship me,  "
"1759","Exodus","9","14","or this time I will send the full force of my plagues against you and against your officials and your people, so you may know that there is no one like me in all the earth.  "
"1760","Exodus","9","15","For by now I could have stretched out my hand and struck you and your people with a plague that would have wiped you off the earth.  "
"1761","Exodus","9","16","But I have raised you up  for this very purpose, that I might show you my power and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth.  "
"1762","Exodus","9","17","You still set yourself against my people and will not let them go.  "
"1763","Exodus","9","18","Therefore, at this time tomorrow I will send the worst hailstorm that has ever fallen on Egypt, from the day it was founded till now.  "
"1764","Exodus","9","19","Give an order now to bring your livestock and everything you have in the field to a place of shelter, because the hail will fall on every person and animal that has not been brought in and is still out in the field, and they will die.’ ” "
"1765","Exodus","9","20","Those officials of Pharaoh who feared the word of the  Lord  hurried to bring their slaves and their livestock inside.  "
"1766","Exodus","9","21","But those who ignored the word of the  Lord  left their slaves and livestock in the field. "
"1767","Exodus","9","22","Then the  Lord  said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand toward the sky so that hail will fall all over Egypt—on people and animals and on everything growing in the fields of Egypt.”  "
"1768","Exodus","9","23","When Moses stretched out his staff toward the sky, the  Lord  sent thunder and hail, and lightning flashed down to the ground. So the  Lord  rained hail on the land of Egypt;  "
"1769","Exodus","9","24","hail fell and lightning flashed back and forth. It was the worst storm in all the land of Egypt since it had become a nation.  "
"1770","Exodus","9","25","Throughout Egypt hail struck everything in the fields—both people and animals; it beat down everything growing in the fields and stripped every tree.  "
"1771","Exodus","9","26","The only place it did not hail was the land of Goshen, where the Israelites were. "
"1772","Exodus","9","27","Then Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron. “This time I have sinned,” he said to them. “The  Lord  is in the right, and I and my people are in the wrong.  "
"1773","Exodus","9","28","Pray to the  Lord , for we have had enough thunder and hail. I will let you go; you don’t have to stay any longer.” "
"1774","Exodus","9","29","Moses replied, “When I have gone out of the city, I will spread out my hands in prayer to the  Lord . The thunder will stop and there will be no more hail, so you may know that the earth is the  Lord ’s.  "
"1775","Exodus","9","30","But I know that you and your officials still do not fear the  Lord  God.” "
"1776","Exodus","9","31","(The flax and barley were destroyed, since the barley had headed and the flax was in bloom.  "
"1777","Exodus","9","32","The wheat and spelt, however, were not destroyed, because they ripen later.) "
"1778","Exodus","9","33","Then Moses left Pharaoh and went out of the city. He spread out his hands toward the  Lord ; the thunder and hail stopped, and the rain no longer poured down on the land.  "
"1779","Exodus","9","34","When Pharaoh saw that the rain and hail and thunder had stopped, he sinned again: He and his officials hardened their hearts.  "
"1780","Exodus","9","35","So Pharaoh’s heart was hard and he would not let the Israelites go, just as the  Lord  had said through Moses."
"1781","Exodus","10","1","Then the  Lord  said to Moses, “Go to Pharaoh, for I have hardened his heart and the hearts of his officials so that I may perform these signs of mine among them  "
"1782","Exodus","10","2","that you may tell your children and grandchildren how I dealt harshly with the Egyptians and how I performed my signs among them, and that you may know that I am the  Lord .” "
"1783","Exodus","10","3","So Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and said to him, “This is what the  Lord , the God of the Hebrews, says: ‘How long will you refuse to humble yourself before me? Let my people go, so that they may worship me.  "
"1784","Exodus","10","4","If you refuse to let them go, I will bring locusts into your country tomorrow.  "
"1785","Exodus","10","5","They will cover the face of the ground so that it cannot be seen. They will devour what little you have left after the hail, including every tree that is growing in your fields.  "
"1786","Exodus","10","6","They will fill your houses and those of all your officials and all the Egyptians—something neither your parents nor your ancestors have ever seen from the day they settled in this land till now.’ ” Then Moses turned and left Pharaoh. "
"1787","Exodus","10","7","Pharaoh’s officials said to him, “How long will this man be a snare to us? Let the people go, so that they may worship the  Lord  their God. Do you not yet realize that Egypt is ruined?” "
"1788","Exodus","10","8","Then Moses and Aaron were brought back to Pharaoh. “Go, worship the  Lord  your God,” he said. “But tell me who will be going.” "
"1789","Exodus","10","9","Moses answered, “We will go with our young and our old, with our sons and our daughters, and with our flocks and herds, because we are to celebrate a festival to the  Lord .” "
"1790","Exodus","10","10","Pharaoh said, “The  Lord  be with you—if I let you go, along with your women and children! Clearly you are bent on evil.   "
"1791","Exodus","10","11","No! Have only the men go and worship the  Lord , since that’s what you have been asking for.” Then Moses and Aaron were driven out of Pharaoh’s presence. "
"1792","Exodus","10","12","And the  Lord  said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand over Egypt so that locusts swarm over the land and devour everything growing in the fields, everything left by the hail.” "
"1793","Exodus","10","13","So Moses stretched out his staff over Egypt, and the  Lord  made an east wind blow across the land all that day and all that night. By morning the wind had brought the locusts;  "
"1794","Exodus","10","14","they invaded all Egypt and settled down in every area of the country in great numbers. Never before had there been such a plague of locusts, nor will there ever be again.  "
"1795","Exodus","10","15","They covered all the ground until it was black. They devoured all that was left after the hail—everything growing in the fields and the fruit on the trees. Nothing green remained on tree or plant in all the land of Egypt. "
"1796","Exodus","10","16","Pharaoh quickly summoned Moses and Aaron and said, “I have sinned against the  Lord  your God and against you.  "
"1797","Exodus","10","17","Now forgive my sin once more and pray to the  Lord  your God to take this deadly plague away from me.” "
"1798","Exodus","10","18","Moses then left Pharaoh and prayed to the  Lord .  "
"1799","Exodus","10","19","And the  Lord  changed the wind to a very strong west wind, which caught up the locusts and carried them into the Red Sea.  Not a locust was left anywhere in Egypt.  "
"1800","Exodus","10","20","But the  Lord  hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he would not let the Israelites go. "
"1801","Exodus","10","21","Then the  Lord  said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand toward the sky so that darkness spreads over Egypt—darkness that can be felt.”  "
"1802","Exodus","10","22","So Moses stretched out his hand toward the sky, and total darkness covered all Egypt for three days.  "
"1803","Exodus","10","23","No one could see anyone else or move about for three days. Yet all the Israelites had light in the places where they lived. "
"1804","Exodus","10","24","Then Pharaoh summoned Moses and said, “Go, worship the  Lord . Even your women and children may go with you; only leave your flocks and herds behind.” "
"1805","Exodus","10","25","But Moses said, “You must allow us to have sacrifices and burnt offerings to present to the  Lord  our God.  "
"1806","Exodus","10","26","Our livestock too must go with us; not a hoof is to be left behind. We have to use some of them in worshiping the  Lord  our God, and until we get there we will not know what we are to use to worship the  Lord .” "
"1807","Exodus","10","27","But the  Lord  hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he was not willing to let them go.  "
"1808","Exodus","10","28","Pharaoh said to Moses, “Get out of my sight! Make sure you do not appear before me again! The day you see my face you will die.” "
"1809","Exodus","10","29","“Just as you say,” Moses replied. “I will never appear before you again.”"
"1810","Exodus","11","1","Now the  Lord  had said to Moses, “I will bring one more plague on Pharaoh and on Egypt. After that, he will let you go from here, and when he does, he will drive you out completely.  "
"1811","Exodus","11","2","Tell the people that men and women alike are to ask their neighbors for articles of silver and gold.”  "
"1812","Exodus","11","3","(The  Lord  made the Egyptians favorably disposed toward the people, and Moses himself was highly regarded in Egypt by Pharaoh’s officials and by the people.) "
"1813","Exodus","11","4","So Moses said, “This is what the  Lord  says: ‘About midnight I will go throughout Egypt.  "
"1814","Exodus","11","5","Every firstborn son in Egypt will die, from the firstborn son of Pharaoh, who sits on the throne, to the firstborn son of the female slave, who is at her hand mill, and all the firstborn of the cattle as well.  "
"1815","Exodus","11","6","There will be loud wailing throughout Egypt—worse than there has ever been or ever will be again.  "
"1816","Exodus","11","7","But among the Israelites not a dog will bark at any person or animal.’ Then you will know that the  Lord  makes a distinction between Egypt and Israel.  "
"1817","Exodus","11","8","All these officials of yours will come to me, bowing down before me and saying, ‘Go, you and all the people who follow you!’ After that I will leave.” Then Moses, hot with anger, left Pharaoh. "
"1818","Exodus","11","9","The  Lord  had said to Moses, “Pharaoh will refuse to listen to you—so that my wonders may be multiplied in Egypt.”  "
"1819","Exodus","11","10","Moses and Aaron performed all these wonders before Pharaoh, but the  Lord  hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he would not let the Israelites go out of his country."
"1820","Exodus","12","1","The  Lord  said to Moses and Aaron in Egypt,  "
"1821","Exodus","12","2","“This month is to be for you the first month, the first month of your year.  "
"1822","Exodus","12","3","Tell the whole community of Israel that on the tenth day of this month each man is to take a lamb  for his family, one for each household.  "
"1823","Exodus","12","4","If any household is too small for a whole lamb, they must share one with their nearest neighbor, having taken into account the number of people there are. You are to determine the amount of lamb needed in accordance with what each person will eat.  "
"1824","Exodus","12","5","The animals you choose must be year-old males without defect, and you may take them from the sheep or the goats.  "
"1825","Exodus","12","6","Take care of them until the fourteenth day of the month, when all the members of the community of Israel must slaughter them at twilight.  "
"1826","Exodus","12","7","Then they are to take some of the blood and put it on the sides and tops of the doorframes of the houses where they eat the lambs.  "
"1827","Exodus","12","8","That same night they are to eat the meat roasted over the fire, along with bitter herbs, and bread made without yeast.  "
"1828","Exodus","12","9","Do not eat the meat raw or boiled in water, but roast it over a fire—with the head, legs and internal organs.  "
"1829","Exodus","12","10","Do not leave any of it till morning; if some is left till morning, you must burn it.  "
"1830","Exodus","12","11","This is how you are to eat it: with your cloak tucked into your belt, your sandals on your feet and your staff in your hand. Eat it in haste; it is the  Lord ’s Passover. "
"1831","Exodus","12","12","“On that same night I will pass through Egypt and strike down every firstborn of both people and animals, and I will bring judgment on all the gods of Egypt. I am the  Lord .  "
"1832","Exodus","12","13","The blood will be a sign for you on the houses where you are, and when I see the blood, I will pass over you. No destructive plague will touch you when I strike Egypt. "
"1833","Exodus","12","14","“This is a day you are to commemorate; for the generations to come you shall celebrate it as a festival to the  Lord —a lasting ordinance.  "
"1834","Exodus","12","15","For seven days you are to eat bread made without yeast. On the first day remove the yeast from your houses, for whoever eats anything with yeast in it from the first day through the seventh must be cut off from Israel.  "
"1835","Exodus","12","16","On the first day hold a sacred assembly, and another one on the seventh day. Do no work at all on these days, except to prepare food for everyone to eat; that is all you may do. "
"1836","Exodus","12","17","“Celebrate the Festival of Unleavened Bread, because it was on this very day that I brought your divisions out of Egypt. Celebrate this day as a lasting ordinance for the generations to come.  "
"1837","Exodus","12","18","In the first month you are to eat bread made without yeast, from the evening of the fourteenth day until the evening of the twenty-first day.  "
"1838","Exodus","12","19","For seven days no yeast is to be found in your houses. And anyone, whether foreigner or native-born, who eats anything with yeast in it must be cut off from the community of Israel.  "
"1839","Exodus","12","20","Eat nothing made with yeast. Wherever you live, you must eat unleavened bread.” "
"1840","Exodus","12","21","Then Moses summoned all the elders of Israel and said to them, “Go at once and select the animals for your families and slaughter the Passover lamb.  "
"1841","Exodus","12","22","Take a bunch of hyssop, dip it into the blood in the basin and put some of the blood on the top and on both sides of the doorframe. None of you shall go out of the door of your house until morning.  "
"1842","Exodus","12","23","When the  Lord  goes through the land to strike down the Egyptians, he will see the blood on the top and sides of the doorframe and will pass over that doorway, and he will not permit the destroyer to enter your houses and strike you down. "
"1843","Exodus","12","24","“Obey these instructions as a lasting ordinance for you and your descendants.  "
"1844","Exodus","12","25","When you enter the land that the  Lord  will give you as he promised, observe this ceremony.  "
"1845","Exodus","12","26","And when your children ask you, ‘What does this ceremony mean to you?’  "
"1846","Exodus","12","27","then tell them, ‘It is the Passover sacrifice to the  Lord , who passed over the houses of the Israelites in Egypt and spared our homes when he struck down the Egyptians.’ ” Then the people bowed down and worshiped.  "
"1847","Exodus","12","28","The Israelites did just what the  Lord  commanded Moses and Aaron. "
"1848","Exodus","12","29","At midnight the  Lord  struck down all the firstborn in Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh, who sat on the throne, to the firstborn of the prisoner, who was in the dungeon, and the firstborn of all the livestock as well.  "
"1849","Exodus","12","30","Pharaoh and all his officials and all the Egyptians got up during the night, and there was loud wailing in Egypt, for there was not a house without someone dead. "
"1850","Exodus","12","31","During the night Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron and said, “Up! Leave my people, you and the Israelites! Go, worship the  Lord  as you have requested.  "
"1851","Exodus","12","32","Take your flocks and herds, as you have said, and go. And also bless me.” "
"1852","Exodus","12","33","The Egyptians urged the people to hurry and leave the country. “For otherwise,” they said, “we will all die!”  "
"1853","Exodus","12","34","So the people took their dough before the yeast was added, and carried it on their shoulders in kneading troughs wrapped in clothing.  "
"1854","Exodus","12","35","The Israelites did as Moses instructed and asked the Egyptians for articles of silver and gold and for clothing.  "
"1855","Exodus","12","36","The  Lord  had made the Egyptians favorably disposed toward the people, and they gave them what they asked for; so they plundered the Egyptians. "
"1856","Exodus","12","37","The Israelites journeyed from Rameses to Sukkoth. There were about six hundred thousand men on foot, besides women and children.  "
"1857","Exodus","12","38","Many other people went up with them, and also large droves of livestock, both flocks and herds.  "
"1858","Exodus","12","39","With the dough the Israelites had brought from Egypt, they baked loaves of unleavened bread. The dough was without yeast because they had been driven out of Egypt and did not have time to prepare food for themselves. "
"1859","Exodus","12","40","Now the length of time the Israelite people lived in Egypt  was 430 years.  "
"1860","Exodus","12","41","At the end of the 430 years, to the very day, all the  Lord ’s divisions left Egypt.  "
"1861","Exodus","12","42","Because the  Lord  kept vigil that night to bring them out of Egypt, on this night all the Israelites are to keep vigil to honor the  Lord  for the generations to come. "
"1862","Exodus","12","43","The  Lord  said to Moses and Aaron, “These are the regulations for the Passover meal: “No foreigner may eat it.  "
"1863","Exodus","12","44","Any slave you have bought may eat it after you have circumcised him,  "
"1864","Exodus","12","45","but a temporary resident or a hired worker may not eat it. "
"1865","Exodus","12","46","“It must be eaten inside the house; take none of the meat outside the house. Do not break any of the bones.  "
"1866","Exodus","12","47","The whole community of Israel must celebrate it. "
"1867","Exodus","12","48","“A foreigner residing among you who wants to celebrate the  Lord ’s Passover must have all the males in his household circumcised; then he may take part like one born in the land. No uncircumcised male may eat it.  "
"1868","Exodus","12","49","The same law applies both to the native-born and to the foreigner residing among you.” "
"1869","Exodus","12","50","All the Israelites did just what the  Lord  had commanded Moses and Aaron.  "
"1870","Exodus","12","51","And on that very day the  Lord  brought the Israelites out of Egypt by their divisions."
"1871","Exodus","13","1","The  Lord  said to Moses,  "
"1872","Exodus","13","2","“Consecrate to me every firstborn male. The first offspring of every womb among the Israelites belongs to me, whether human or animal.” "
"1873","Exodus","13","3","Then Moses said to the people, “Commemorate this day, the day you came out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery, because the  Lord  brought you out of it with a mighty hand. Eat nothing containing yeast.  "
"1874","Exodus","13","4","Today, in the month of Aviv, you are leaving.  "
"1875","Exodus","13","5","When the  Lord  brings you into the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Hivites and Jebusites—the land he swore to your ancestors to give you, a land flowing with milk and honey—you are to observe this ceremony in this month:  "
"1876","Exodus","13","6","For seven days eat bread made without yeast and on the seventh day hold a festival to the  Lord .  "
"1877","Exodus","13","7","Eat unleavened bread during those seven days; nothing with yeast in it is to be seen among you, nor shall any yeast be seen anywhere within your borders.  "
"1878","Exodus","13","8","On that day tell your son, ‘I do this because of what the  Lord  did for me when I came out of Egypt.’  "
"1879","Exodus","13","9","This observance will be for you like a sign on your hand and a reminder on your forehead that this law of the  Lord  is to be on your lips. For the  Lord  brought you out of Egypt with his mighty hand.  "
"1880","Exodus","13","10","You must keep this ordinance at the appointed time year after year. "
"1881","Exodus","13","11","“After the  Lord  brings you into the land of the Canaanites and gives it to you, as he promised on oath to you and your ancestors,  "
"1882","Exodus","13","12","you are to give over to the  Lord  the first offspring of every womb. All the firstborn males of your livestock belong to the  Lord .  "
"1883","Exodus","13","13","Redeem with a lamb every firstborn donkey, but if you do not redeem it, break its neck. Redeem every firstborn among your sons. "
"1884","Exodus","13","14","“In days to come, when your son asks you, ‘What does this mean?’ say to him, ‘With a mighty hand the  Lord  brought us out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery.  "
"1885","Exodus","13","15","When Pharaoh stubbornly refused to let us go, the  Lord  killed the firstborn of both people and animals in Egypt. This is why I sacrifice to the  Lord  the first male offspring of every womb and redeem each of my firstborn sons.’  "
"1886","Exodus","13","16","And it will be like a sign on your hand and a symbol on your forehead that the  Lord  brought us out of Egypt with his mighty hand.” "
"1887","Exodus","13","17","When Pharaoh let the people go, God did not lead them on the road through the Philistine country, though that was shorter. For God said, “If they face war, they might change their minds and return to Egypt.”  "
"1888","Exodus","13","18","So God led the people around by the desert road toward the Red Sea.  The Israelites went up out of Egypt ready for battle. "
"1889","Exodus","13","19","Moses took the bones of Joseph with him because Joseph had made the Israelites swear an oath. He had said, “God will surely come to your aid, and then you must carry my bones up with you from this place.” "
"1890","Exodus","13","20","After leaving Sukkoth they camped at Etham on the edge of the desert.  "
"1891","Exodus","13","21","By day the  Lord  went ahead of them in a pillar of cloud to guide them on their way and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light, so that they could travel by day or night.  "
"1892","Exodus","13","22","Neither the pillar of cloud by day nor the pillar of fire by night left its place in front of the people."
"1893","Exodus","14","1","Then the  Lord  said to Moses,  "
"1894","Exodus","14","2","“Tell the Israelites to turn back and encamp near Pi Hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea. They are to encamp by the sea, directly opposite Baal Zephon.  "
"1895","Exodus","14","3","Pharaoh will think, ‘The Israelites are wandering around the land in confusion, hemmed in by the desert.’  "
"1896","Exodus","14","4","And I will harden Pharaoh’s heart, and he will pursue them. But I will gain glory for myself through Pharaoh and all his army, and the Egyptians will know that I am the  Lord .” So the Israelites did this. "
"1897","Exodus","14","5","When the king of Egypt was told that the people had fled, Pharaoh and his officials changed their minds about them and said, “What have we done? We have let the Israelites go and have lost their services!”  "
"1898","Exodus","14","6","So he had his chariot made ready and took his army with him.  "
"1899","Exodus","14","7","He took six hundred of the best chariots, along with all the other chariots of Egypt, with officers over all of them.  "
"1900","Exodus","14","8","The  Lord  hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, so that he pursued the Israelites, who were marching out boldly.  "
"1901","Exodus","14","9","The Egyptians—all Pharaoh’s horses and chariots, horsemen  and troops—pursued the Israelites and overtook them as they camped by the sea near Pi Hahiroth, opposite Baal Zephon. "
"1902","Exodus","14","10","As Pharaoh approached, the Israelites looked up, and there were the Egyptians, marching after them. They were terrified and cried out to the  Lord .  "
"1903","Exodus","14","11","They said to Moses, “Was it because there were no graves in Egypt that you brought us to the desert to die? What have you done to us by bringing us out of Egypt?  "
"1904","Exodus","14","12","Didn’t we say to you in Egypt, ‘Leave us alone; let us serve the Egyptians’? It would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in the desert!” "
"1905","Exodus","14","13","Moses answered the people, “Do not be afraid. Stand firm and you will see the deliverance the  Lord  will bring you today. The Egyptians you see today you will never see again.  "
"1906","Exodus","14","14","The  Lord  will fight for you; you need only to be still.” "
"1907","Exodus","14","15","Then the  Lord  said to Moses, “Why are you crying out to me? Tell the Israelites to move on.  "
"1908","Exodus","14","16","Raise your staff and stretch out your hand over the sea to divide the water so that the Israelites can go through the sea on dry ground.  "
"1909","Exodus","14","17","I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians so that they will go in after them. And I will gain glory through Pharaoh and all his army, through his chariots and his horsemen.  "
"1910","Exodus","14","18","The Egyptians will know that I am the  Lord  when I gain glory through Pharaoh, his chariots and his horsemen.” "
"1911","Exodus","14","19","Then the angel of God, who had been traveling in front of Israel’s army, withdrew and went behind them. The pillar of cloud also moved from in front and stood behind them,  "
"1912","Exodus","14","20","coming between the armies of Egypt and Israel. Throughout the night the cloud brought darkness to the one side and light to the other side; so neither went near the other all night long. "
"1913","Exodus","14","21","Then Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and all that night the  Lord  drove the sea back with a strong east wind and turned it into dry land. The waters were divided,  "
"1914","Exodus","14","22","and the Israelites went through the sea on dry ground, with a wall of water on their right and on their left. "
"1915","Exodus","14","23","The Egyptians pursued them, and all Pharaoh’s horses and chariots and horsemen followed them into the sea.  "
"1916","Exodus","14","24","During the last watch of the night the  Lord  looked down from the pillar of fire and cloud at the Egyptian army and threw it into confusion.  "
"1917","Exodus","14","25","He jammed  the wheels of their chariots so that they had difficulty driving. And the Egyptians said, “Let’s get away from the Israelites! The  Lord  is fighting for them against Egypt.” "
"1918","Exodus","14","26","Then the  Lord  said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand over the sea so that the waters may flow back over the Egyptians and their chariots and horsemen.”  "
"1919","Exodus","14","27","Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and at daybreak the sea went back to its place. The Egyptians were fleeing toward  it, and the  Lord  swept them into the sea.  "
"1920","Exodus","14","28","The water flowed back and covered the chariots and horsemen—the entire army of Pharaoh that had followed the Israelites into the sea. Not one of them survived. "
"1921","Exodus","14","29","But the Israelites went through the sea on dry ground, with a wall of water on their right and on their left.  "
"1922","Exodus","14","30","That day the  Lord  saved Israel from the hands of the Egyptians, and Israel saw the Egyptians lying dead on the shore.  "
"1923","Exodus","14","31","And when the Israelites saw the mighty hand of the  Lord  displayed against the Egyptians, the people feared the  Lord  and put their trust in him and in Moses his servant."
"1924","Exodus","15","1","Then Moses and the Israelites sang this song to the  Lord : “I will sing to the  Lord , for he is highly exalted. Both horse and driver he has hurled into the sea. "
"1925","Exodus","15","2","“The  Lord  is my strength and my defense ; he has become my salvation. He is my God, and I will praise him, my father’s God, and I will exalt him. "
"1926","Exodus","15","3","The  Lord  is a warrior; the  Lord  is his name. "
"1927","Exodus","15","4","Pharaoh’s chariots and his army he has hurled into the sea. The best of Pharaoh’s officers are drowned in the Red Sea. "
"1928","Exodus","15","5","The deep waters have covered them; they sank to the depths like a stone. "
"1929","Exodus","15","6","Your right hand,  Lord , was majestic in power. Your right hand,  Lord , shattered the enemy. "
"1930","Exodus","15","7","“In the greatness of your majesty you threw down those who opposed you. You unleashed your burning anger; it consumed them like stubble. "
"1931","Exodus","15","8","By the blast of your nostrils the waters piled up. The surging waters stood up like a wall; the deep waters congealed in the heart of the sea. "
"1932","Exodus","15","9","The enemy boasted, ‘I will pursue, I will overtake them. I will divide the spoils; I will gorge myself on them. I will draw my sword and my hand will destroy them.’ "
"1933","Exodus","15","10","But you blew with your breath, and the sea covered them. They sank like lead in the mighty waters. "
"1934","Exodus","15","11","Who among the gods is like you,  Lord ? Who is like you— majestic in holiness, awesome in glory, working wonders? "
"1935","Exodus","15","12","“You stretch out your right hand, and the earth swallows your enemies. "
"1936","Exodus","15","13","In your unfailing love you will lead the people you have redeemed. In your strength you will guide them to your holy dwelling. "
"1937","Exodus","15","14","The nations will hear and tremble; anguish will grip the people of Philistia. "
"1938","Exodus","15","15","The chiefs of Edom will be terrified, the leaders of Moab will be seized with trembling, the people  of Canaan will melt away; "
"1939","Exodus","15","16","terror and dread will fall on them. By the power of your arm they will be as still as a stone— until your people pass by,  Lord , until the people you bought  pass by. "
"1940","Exodus","15","17","You will bring them in and plant them on the mountain of your inheritance— the place,  Lord , you made for your dwelling, the sanctuary, Lord, your hands established. "
"1941","Exodus","15","18","“The  Lord  reigns for ever and ever.” "
"1942","Exodus","15","19","When Pharaoh’s horses, chariots and horsemen  went into the sea, the  Lord  brought the waters of the sea back over them, but the Israelites walked through the sea on dry ground.  "
"1943","Exodus","15","20","Then Miriam the prophet, Aaron’s sister, took a timbrel in her hand, and all the women followed her, with timbrels and dancing.  "
"1944","Exodus","15","21","Miriam sang to them: “Sing to the  Lord , for he is highly exalted. Both horse and driver he has hurled into the sea.” "
"1945","Exodus","15","22","Then Moses led Israel from the Red Sea and they went into the Desert of Shur. For three days they traveled in the desert without finding water.  "
"1946","Exodus","15","23","When they came to Marah, they could not drink its water because it was bitter. (That is why the place is called Marah. )  "
"1947","Exodus","15","24","So the people grumbled against Moses, saying, “What are we to drink?” "
"1948","Exodus","15","25","Then Moses cried out to the  Lord , and the  Lord  showed him a piece of wood. He threw it into the water, and the water became fit to drink. There the  Lord  issued a ruling and instruction for them and put them to the test.  "
"1949","Exodus","15","26","He said, “If you listen carefully to the  Lord  your God and do what is right in his eyes, if you pay attention to his commands and keep all his decrees, I will not bring on you any of the diseases I brought on the Egyptians, for I am the  Lord , who heals you.” "
"1950","Exodus","15","27","Then they came to Elim, where there were twelve springs and seventy palm trees, and they camped there near the water."
"1951","Exodus","16","1","The whole Israelite community set out from Elim and came to the Desert of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after they had come out of Egypt.  "
"1952","Exodus","16","2","In the desert the whole community grumbled against Moses and Aaron.  "
"1953","Exodus","16","3","The Israelites said to them, “If only we had died by the  Lord ’s hand in Egypt! There we sat around pots of meat and ate all the food we wanted, but you have brought us out into this desert to starve this entire assembly to death.” "
"1954","Exodus","16","4","Then the  Lord  said to Moses, “I will rain down bread from heaven for you. The people are to go out each day and gather enough for that day. In this way I will test them and see whether they will follow my instructions.  "
"1955","Exodus","16","5","On the sixth day they are to prepare what they bring in, and that is to be twice as much as they gather on the other days.” "
"1956","Exodus","16","6","So Moses and Aaron said to all the Israelites, “In the evening you will know that it was the  Lord  who brought you out of Egypt,  "
"1957","Exodus","16","7","and in the morning you will see the glory of the  Lord , because he has heard your grumbling against him. Who are we, that you should grumble against us?”  "
"1958","Exodus","16","8","Moses also said, “You will know that it was the  Lord  when he gives you meat to eat in the evening and all the bread you want in the morning, because he has heard your grumbling against him. Who are we? You are not grumbling against us, but against the  Lord .” "
"1959","Exodus","16","9","Then Moses told Aaron, “Say to the entire Israelite community, ‘Come before the  Lord , for he has heard your grumbling.’ ” "
"1960","Exodus","16","10","While Aaron was speaking to the whole Israelite community, they looked toward the desert, and there was the glory of the  Lord  appearing in the cloud. "
"1961","Exodus","16","11","The  Lord  said to Moses,  "
"1962","Exodus","16","12","“I have heard the grumbling of the Israelites. Tell them, ‘At twilight you will eat meat, and in the morning you will be filled with bread. Then you will know that I am the  Lord  your God.’ ” "
"1963","Exodus","16","13","That evening quail came and covered the camp, and in the morning there was a layer of dew around the camp.  "
"1964","Exodus","16","14","When the dew was gone, thin flakes like frost on the ground appeared on the desert floor.  "
"1965","Exodus","16","15","When the Israelites saw it, they said to each other, “What is it?” For they did not know what it was. Moses said to them, “It is the bread the  Lord  has given you to eat.  "
"1966","Exodus","16","16","This is what the  Lord  has commanded: ‘Everyone is to gather as much as they need. Take an omer  for each person you have in your tent.’ ” "
"1967","Exodus","16","17","The Israelites did as they were told; some gathered much, some little.  "
"1968","Exodus","16","18","And when they measured it by the omer, the one who gathered much did not have too much, and the one who gathered little did not have too little. Everyone had gathered just as much as they needed. "
"1969","Exodus","16","19","Then Moses said to them, “No one is to keep any of it until morning.” "
"1970","Exodus","16","20","However, some of them paid no attention to Moses; they kept part of it until morning, but it was full of maggots and began to smell. So Moses was angry with them. "
"1971","Exodus","16","21","Each morning everyone gathered as much as they needed, and when the sun grew hot, it melted away.  "
"1972","Exodus","16","22","On the sixth day, they gathered twice as much—two omers  for each person—and the leaders of the community came and reported this to Moses.  "
"1973","Exodus","16","23","He said to them, “This is what the  Lord  commanded: ‘Tomorrow is to be a day of sabbath rest, a holy sabbath to the  Lord . So bake what you want to bake and boil what you want to boil. Save whatever is left and keep it until morning.’ ” "
"1974","Exodus","16","24","So they saved it until morning, as Moses commanded, and it did not stink or get maggots in it.  "
"1975","Exodus","16","25","“Eat it today,” Moses said, “because today is a sabbath to the  Lord . You will not find any of it on the ground today.  "
"1976","Exodus","16","26","Six days you are to gather it, but on the seventh day, the Sabbath, there will not be any.” "
"1977","Exodus","16","27","Nevertheless, some of the people went out on the seventh day to gather it, but they found none.  "
"1978","Exodus","16","28","Then the  Lord  said to Moses, “How long will you  refuse to keep my commands and my instructions?  "
"1979","Exodus","16","29","Bear in mind that the  Lord  has given you the Sabbath; that is why on the sixth day he gives you bread for two days. Everyone is to stay where they are on the seventh day; no one is to go out.”  "
"1980","Exodus","16","30","So the people rested on the seventh day. "
"1981","Exodus","16","31","The people of Israel called the bread manna.  It was white like coriander seed and tasted like wafers made with honey.  "
"1982","Exodus","16","32","Moses said, “This is what the  Lord  has commanded: ‘Take an omer of manna and keep it for the generations to come, so they can see the bread I gave you to eat in the wilderness when I brought you out of Egypt.’ ” "
"1983","Exodus","16","33","So Moses said to Aaron, “Take a jar and put an omer of manna in it. Then place it before the  Lord  to be kept for the generations to come.” "
"1984","Exodus","16","34","As the  Lord  commanded Moses, Aaron put the manna with the tablets of the covenant law, so that it might be preserved.  "
"1985","Exodus","16","35","The Israelites ate manna forty years, until they came to a land that was settled; they ate manna until they reached the border of Canaan. "
"1986","Exodus","16","36","(An omer is one-tenth of an ephah.)"
"1987","Exodus","17","1","The whole Israelite community set out from the Desert of Sin, traveling from place to place as the  Lord  commanded. They camped at Rephidim, but there was no water for the people to drink.  "
"1988","Exodus","17","2","So they quarreled with Moses and said, “Give us water to drink.” Moses replied, “Why do you quarrel with me? Why do you put the  Lord  to the test?” "
"1989","Exodus","17","3","But the people were thirsty for water there, and they grumbled against Moses. They said, “Why did you bring us up out of Egypt to make us and our children and livestock die of thirst?” "
"1990","Exodus","17","4","Then Moses cried out to the  Lord , “What am I to do with these people? They are almost ready to stone me.” "
"1991","Exodus","17","5","The  Lord  answered Moses, “Go out in front of the people. Take with you some of the elders of Israel and take in your hand the staff with which you struck the Nile, and go.  "
"1992","Exodus","17","6","I will stand there before you by the rock at Horeb. Strike the rock, and water will come out of it for the people to drink.” So Moses did this in the sight of the elders of Israel.  "
"1993","Exodus","17","7","And he called the place Massah  and Meribah  because the Israelites quarreled and because they tested the  Lord  saying, “Is the  Lord  among us or not?” "
"1994","Exodus","17","8","The Amalekites came and attacked the Israelites at Rephidim.  "
"1995","Exodus","17","9","Moses said to Joshua, “Choose some of our men and go out to fight the Amalekites. Tomorrow I will stand on top of the hill with the staff of God in my hands.” "
"1996","Exodus","17","10","So Joshua fought the Amalekites as Moses had ordered, and Moses, Aaron and Hur went to the top of the hill.  "
"1997","Exodus","17","11","As long as Moses held up his hands, the Israelites were winning, but whenever he lowered his hands, the Amalekites were winning.  "
"1998","Exodus","17","12","When Moses’ hands grew tired, they took a stone and put it under him and he sat on it. Aaron and Hur held his hands up—one on one side, one on the other—so that his hands remained steady till sunset.  "
"1999","Exodus","17","13","So Joshua overcame the Amalekite army with the sword. "
"2000","Exodus","17","14","Then the  Lord  said to Moses, “Write this on a scroll as something to be remembered and make sure that Joshua hears it, because I will completely blot out the name of Amalek from under heaven.” "
"2001","Exodus","17","15","Moses built an altar and called it The  Lord  is my Banner.  "
"2002","Exodus","17","16","He said, “Because hands were lifted up against  the throne of the  Lord ,  the  Lord  will be at war against the Amalekites from generation to generation.”"
"2003","Exodus","19","1","On the first day of the third month after the Israelites left Egypt—on that very day—they came to the Desert of Sinai.  "
"2004","Exodus","19","2","After they set out from Rephidim, they entered the Desert of Sinai, and Israel camped there in the desert in front of the mountain. "
"2005","Exodus","19","3","Then Moses went up to God, and the  Lord  called to him from the mountain and said, “This is what you are to say to the descendants of Jacob and what you are to tell the people of Israel:  "
"2006","Exodus","19","4","‘You yourselves have seen what I did to Egypt, and how I carried you on eagles’ wings and brought you to myself.  "
"2007","Exodus","19","5","Now if you obey me fully and keep my covenant, then out of all nations you will be my treasured possession. Although the whole earth is mine,  "
"2008","Exodus","19","6","you  will be for me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.’ These are the words you are to speak to the Israelites.” "
"2009","Exodus","19","7","So Moses went back and summoned the elders of the people and set before them all the words the  Lord  had commanded him to speak.  "
"2010","Exodus","19","8","The people all responded together, “We will do everything the  Lord  has said.” So Moses brought their answer back to the  Lord . "
"2011","Exodus","19","9","The  Lord  said to Moses, “I am going to come to you in a dense cloud, so that the people will hear me speaking with you and will always put their trust in you.” Then Moses told the  Lord  what the people had said. "
"2012","Exodus","19","10","And the  Lord  said to Moses, “Go to the people and consecrate them today and tomorrow. Have them wash their clothes  "
"2013","Exodus","19","11","and be ready by the third day, because on that day the  Lord  will come down on Mount Sinai in the sight of all the people.  "
"2014","Exodus","19","12","Put limits for the people around the mountain and tell them, ‘Be careful that you do not approach the mountain or touch the foot of it. Whoever touches the mountain is to be put to death.  "
"2015","Exodus","19","13","They are to be stoned or shot with arrows; not a hand is to be laid on them. No person or animal shall be permitted to live.’ Only when the ram’s horn sounds a long blast may they approach the mountain.” "
"2016","Exodus","19","14","After Moses had gone down the mountain to the people, he consecrated them, and they washed their clothes.  "
"2017","Exodus","19","15","Then he said to the people, “Prepare yourselves for the third day. Abstain from sexual relations.” "
"2018","Exodus","19","16","On the morning of the third day there was thunder and lightning, with a thick cloud over the mountain, and a very loud trumpet blast. Everyone in the camp trembled.  "
"2019","Exodus","19","17","Then Moses led the people out of the camp to meet with God, and they stood at the foot of the mountain.  "
"2020","Exodus","19","18","Mount Sinai was covered with smoke, because the  Lord  descended on it in fire. The smoke billowed up from it like smoke from a furnace, and the whole mountain  trembled violently.  "
"2021","Exodus","19","19","As the sound of the trumpet grew louder and louder, Moses spoke and the voice of God answered him. "
"2022","Exodus","19","20","The  Lord  descended to the top of Mount Sinai and called Moses to the top of the mountain. So Moses went up  "
"2023","Exodus","19","21","and the  Lord  said to him, “Go down and warn the people so they do not force their way through to see the  Lord  and many of them perish.  "
"2024","Exodus","19","22","Even the priests, who approach the  Lord , must consecrate themselves, or the  Lord  will break out against them.” "
"2025","Exodus","19","23","Moses said to the  Lord , “The people cannot come up Mount Sinai, because you yourself warned us, ‘Put limits around the mountain and set it apart as holy.’ ” "
"2026","Exodus","19","24","The  Lord  replied, “Go down and bring Aaron up with you. But the priests and the people must not force their way through to come up to the  Lord , or he will break out against them.” "
"2027","Exodus","19","25","So Moses went down to the people and told them."
"2028","Exodus","20","1","And God spoke all these words: "

"2030","Exodus","20","3","“You shall have no other gods before  me. "

"2032","Exodus","20","5","You shall not bow down to them or worship them; for I, the  Lord  your God, am a jealous God, punishing the children for the sin of the parents to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me,  "
"2033","Exodus","20","6","but showing love to a thousand generations of those who love me and keep my commandments. "
"2034","Exodus","20","7","“You shall not misuse the name of the  Lord  your God, for the  Lord  will not hold anyone guiltless who misuses his name. "

"2036","Exodus","20","9","Six days you shall labor and do all your work,  "

"2038","Exodus","20","11","For in six days the  Lord  made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, but he rested on the seventh day. Therefore the  Lord  blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy. "

"2045","Exodus","20","18","When the people saw the thunder and lightning and heard the trumpet and saw the mountain in smoke, they trembled with fear. They stayed at a distance  "
"2046","Exodus","20","19","and said to Moses, “Speak to us yourself and we will listen. But do not have God speak to us or we will die.” "
"2047","Exodus","20","20","Moses said to the people, “Do not be afraid. God has come to test you, so that the fear of God will be with you to keep you from sinning.” "
"2048","Exodus","20","21","The people remained at a distance, while Moses approached the thick darkness where God was. "

"2142","Exodus","23","21","Pay attention to him and listen to what he says. Do not rebel against him; he will not forgive your rebellion, since my Name is in him.  "
"2143","Exodus","23","22","If you listen carefully to what he says and do all that I say, I will be an enemy to your enemies and will oppose those who oppose you.  "
"2144","Exodus","23","23","My angel will go ahead of you and bring you into the land of the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Canaanites, Hivites and Jebusites, and I will wipe them out.  "
"2145","Exodus","23","24","Do not bow down before their gods or worship them or follow their practices. You must demolish them and break their sacred stones to pieces.  "
"2146","Exodus","23","25","Worship the  Lord  your God, and his blessing will be on your food and water. I will take away sickness from among you,  "

"2148","Exodus","23","27","“I will send my terror ahead of you and throw into confusion every nation you encounter. I will make all your enemies turn their backs and run.  "
"2149","Exodus","23","28","I will send the hornet ahead of you to drive the Hivites, Canaanites and Hittites out of your way.  "
"2150","Exodus","23","29","But I will not drive them out in a single year, because the land would become desolate and the wild animals too numerous for you.  "
"2151","Exodus","23","30","Little by little I will drive them out before you, until you have increased enough to take possession of the land. "
"2152","Exodus","23","31","“I will establish your borders from the Red Sea  to the Mediterranean Sea,  and from the desert to the Euphrates River. I will give into your hands the people who live in the land, and you will drive them out before you.  "
"2153","Exodus","23","32","Do not make a covenant with them or with their gods.  "
"2154","Exodus","23","33","Do not let them live in your land or they will cause you to sin against me, because the worship of their gods will certainly be a snare to you.”"
"2155","Exodus","24","1","Then the  Lord  said to Moses, “Come up to the  Lord , you and Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel. You are to worship at a distance,  "
"2156","Exodus","24","2","but Moses alone is to approach the  Lord ; the others must not come near. And the people may not come up with him.” "
"2157","Exodus","24","3","When Moses went and told the people all the  Lord ’s words and laws, they responded with one voice, “Everything the  Lord  has said we will do.”  "
"2158","Exodus","24","4","Moses then wrote down everything the  Lord  had said. He got up early the next morning and built an altar at the foot of the mountain and set up twelve stone pillars representing the twelve tribes of Israel.  "
"2159","Exodus","24","5","Then he sent young Israelite men, and they offered burnt offerings and sacrificed young bulls as fellowship offerings to the  Lord .  "
"2160","Exodus","24","6","Moses took half of the blood and put it in bowls, and the other half he splashed against the altar.  "
"2161","Exodus","24","7","Then he took the Book of the Covenant and read it to the people. They responded, “We will do everything the  Lord  has said; we will obey.” "
"2162","Exodus","24","8","Moses then took the blood, sprinkled it on the people and said, “This is the blood of the covenant that the  Lord  has made with you in accordance with all these words.” "
"2163","Exodus","24","9","Moses and Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, and the seventy elders of Israel went up  "
"2164","Exodus","24","10","and saw the God of Israel. Under his feet was something like a pavement made of lapis lazuli, as bright blue as the sky.  "
"2165","Exodus","24","11","But God did not raise his hand against these leaders of the Israelites; they saw God, and they ate and drank. "
"2166","Exodus","24","12","The  Lord  said to Moses, “Come up to me on the mountain and stay here, and I will give you the tablets of stone with the law and commandments I have written for their instruction.” "

"2168","Exodus","24","14","He said to the elders, “Wait here for us until we come back to you. Aaron and Hur are with you, and anyone involved in a dispute can go to them.” "
"2169","Exodus","24","15","When Moses went up on the mountain, the cloud covered it,  "
"2170","Exodus","24","16","and the glory of the  Lord  settled on Mount Sinai. For six days the cloud covered the mountain, and on the seventh day the  Lord  called to Moses from within the cloud.  "
"2171","Exodus","24","17","To the Israelites the glory of the  Lord  looked like a consuming fire on top of the mountain.  "
"2172","Exodus","24","18","Then Moses entered the cloud as he went on up the mountain. And he stayed on the mountain forty days and forty nights."
"2173","Exodus","25","1","The  Lord  said to Moses,  "
